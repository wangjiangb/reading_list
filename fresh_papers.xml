In thiswork, we propose using discrete-state models to connect them and explore theirscalability in the vision domain. First, we conduct a step-by-step analysis ina unified design space across two types of models includingtimestep-independence, noise schedule, temperature, guidance strength, etc in ascalable manner. Second, we re-cast typical discriminative tasks, e.g., imagesegmentation, as an unmasking process from [MASK]tokens on a discrete-statemodel. This enables us to perform various sampling processes, includingflexible conditional sampling by only training once to model the jointdistribution. All aforementioned explorations lead to our framework namedDiscrete Interpolants, which enables us to achieve state-of-the-art orcompetitive performance compared to previous discrete-state based methods invarious benchmarks, like ImageNet256, MS COCO, and video dataset FaceForensics.In summary, by leveraging [MASK] in discrete-state models, we can bridge MaskedGenerative and Non-autoregressive Diffusion models, as well as generative anddiscriminative tasks.</description><author>Vincent Tao Hu, Bj√∂rn Ommer</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:59:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06787v1</guid></item><item><title>Retrieving Semantics from the Deep: an RAG Solution for Gesture Synthesis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06786v1</link><description>Non-verbal communication often comprises of semantically rich gestures thathelp convey the meaning of an utterance. Producing such semantic co-speechgestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that cangenerate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semanticallymeaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-basedgesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicitgesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures groundedin interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domainknowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures.Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into ourdiffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrievalguidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, wepropose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate theamount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence.Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach againstrecent gesture generation approaches.

However, they often fail to produce realistic geometricdetails, resulting in overly smooth surfaces or geometric details inaccuratelybaked in albedo maps. To address this, we introduce a new method thatincorporates touch as an additional modality to improve the geometric detailsof generated 3D assets. We design a lightweight 3D texture field to synthesizevisual and tactile textures, guided by 2D diffusion model priors on both visualand tactile domains. We condition the visual texture generation onhigh-resolution tactile normals and guide the patch-based tactile texturerefinement with a customized TextureDreambooth. We further present a multi-partgeneration pipeline that enables us to synthesize different textures acrossvarious regions. To our knowledge, we are the first to leverage high-resolutiontactile sensing to enhance geometric details for 3D generation tasks. Weevaluate our method in both text-to-3D and image-to-3D settings. Ourexperiments demonstrate that our method provides customized and realistic finegeometric textures while maintaining accurate alignment between two modalitiesof vision and touch.</description><author>Ruihan Gao, Kangle Deng, Gengshan Yang, Wenzhen Yuan, Jun-Yan Zhu</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:59:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06785v1</guid></item><item><title>P3-PO: Prescriptive Point Priors for Visuo-Spatial Generalization of Robot Policies</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06784v1</link><description>Developing generalizable robot policies that can robustly handle variedenvironmental conditions and object instances remains a fundamental challengein robot learning. While considerable efforts have focused on collecting largerobot datasets and developing policy architectures to learn from such data,naively learning from visual inputs often results in brittle policies that failto transfer beyond the training data. This work presents Prescriptive PointPriors for Policies or P3-PO, a novel framework that constructs a unique staterepresentation of the environment leveraging recent advances in computer visionand robot learning to achieve improved out-of-distribution generalization forrobot manipulation. This representation is obtained through two steps. First, ahuman annotator prescribes a set of semantically meaningful points on a singledemonstration frame. These points are then propagated through the dataset usingoff-the-shelf vision models. The derived points serve as an input tostate-of-the-art policy architectures for policy learning. Our experimentsacross four real-world tasks demonstrate an overall 43% absolute improvementover prior methods when evaluated in identical settings as training. Further,P3-PO exhibits 58% and 80% gains across tasks for new object instances and morecluttered environments respectively.

However, they suffer frominefficiency due to multiple denoising steps and limited flexibility fromcomplex constraints. In this paper, we introduce Coarse-to-Fine AutoRegressivePolicy (CARP), a novel paradigm for visuomotor policy learning that redefinesthe autoregressive action generation process as a coarse-to-fine, next-scaleapproach. CARP decouples action generation into two stages: first, an actionautoencoder learns multi-scale representations of the entire action sequence;then, a GPT-style transformer refines the sequence prediction through acoarse-to-fine autoregressive process. This straightforward and intuitiveapproach produces highly accurate and smooth actions, matching or evensurpassing the performance of diffusion-based policies while maintainingefficiency on par with autoregressive policies. We conduct extensiveevaluations across diverse settings, including single-task and multi-taskscenarios on state-based and image-based simulation benchmarks, as well asreal-world tasks. CARP achieves competitive success rates, with up to a 10%improvement, and delivers 10x faster inference compared to state-of-the-artpolicies, establishing a high-performance, efficient, and flexible paradigm foraction generation in robotic tasks.</description><author>Zhefei Gong, Pengxiang Ding, Shangke Lyu, Siteng Huang, Mingyang Sun, Wei Zhao, Zhaoxin Fan, Donglin Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:59:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06782v1</guid></item><item><title>Around the World in 80 Timesteps: A Generative Approach to Global Visual Geolocation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06781v1</link><description>Global visual geolocation predicts where an image was captured on Earth.Since images vary in how precisely they can be localized, this task inherentlyinvolves a significant degree of ambiguity. However, existing approaches aredeterministic and overlook this aspect. In this paper, we aim to close the gapbetween traditional geolocalization and modern generative methods. We proposethe first generative geolocation approach based on diffusion and Riemannianflow matching, where the denoising process operates directly on the Earth'ssurface. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three visualgeolocation benchmarks: OpenStreetView-5M, YFCC-100M, and iNat21. In addition,we introduce the task of probabilistic visual geolocation, where the modelpredicts a probability distribution over all possible locations instead of asingle point. We introduce new metrics and baselines for this task,demonstrating the advantages of our diffusion-based approach.

A common limitation of existing scoredistillation formulations, however, is that the outputs of the (mode-seeking)optimization are limited in diversity despite the underlying diffusion modelbeing capable of generating diverse samples. In this work, inspired by thesampling process in denoising diffusion, we propose a score formulation thatguides the optimization to follow generation paths defined by random initialseeds, thus ensuring diversity. We then present an approximation to adopt thisformulation for scenarios where the optimization may not precisely follow thegeneration paths (e.g. a 3D representation whose renderings evolve in aco-dependent manner). We showcase the applications of our `Diverse ScoreDistillation' (DSD) formulation across tasks such as 2D optimization,text-based 3D inference, and single-view reconstruction. We also empiricallyvalidate DSD against prior score distillation formulations and show that itsignificantly improves sample diversity while preserving fidelity.</description><author>Yanbo Xu, Jayanth Srinivasa, Gaowen Liu, Shubham Tulsiani</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:59:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06780v1</guid></item><item><title>AnyBimanual: Transferring Unimanual Policy for General Bimanual Manipulation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06779v1</link><description>Performing general language-conditioned bimanual manipulation tasks is ofgreat importance for many applications ranging from household service toindustrial assembly. However, collecting bimanual manipulation data isexpensive due to the high-dimensional action space, which poses challenges forconventional methods to handle general bimanual manipulation tasks. Incontrast, unimanual policy has recently demonstrated impressivegeneralizability across a wide range of tasks because of scaled modelparameters and training data, which can provide sharable manipulation knowledgefor bimanual systems. To this end, we propose a plug-and-play method namedAnyBimanual, which transfers pre-trained unimanual policy to general bimanualmanipulation policy with few bimanual demonstrations. Specifically, we firstintroduce a skill manager to dynamically schedule the skill representationsdiscovered from pre-trained unimanual policy for bimanual manipulation tasks,which linearly combines skill primitives with task-oriented compensation torepresent the bimanual manipulation instruction. To mitigate the observationdiscrepancy between unimanual and bimanual systems, we present a visual alignerto generate soft masks for visual embedding of the workspace, which aims toalign visual input of unimanual policy model for each arm with those duringpretraining stage. AnyBimanual shows superiority on 12 simulated tasks fromRLBench2 with a sizable 12.67% improvement in success rate over previousmethods. Experiments on 9 real-world tasks further verify its practicality withan average success rate of 84.62%.</description><author>Guanxing Lu, Tengbo Yu, Haoyuan Deng, Season Si Chen, Yansong Tang, Ziwei Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:58:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06779v1</guid></item><item><title>Data Attribution for Text-to-Image Models by Unlearning Synthesized Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09408v2</link><description>The goal of data attribution for text-to-image models is to identify thetraining images that most influence the generation of a new image. Influence isdefined such that, for a given output, if a model is retrained from scratchwithout the most influential images, the model would fail to reproduce the sameoutput. Unfortunately, directly searching for these influential images iscomputationally infeasible, since it would require repeatedly retraining modelsfrom scratch. In our work, we propose an efficient data attribution method bysimulating unlearning the synthesized image. We achieve this by increasing thetraining loss on the output image, without catastrophic forgetting of other,unrelated concepts. We then identify training images with significant lossdeviations after the unlearning process and label these as influential. Weevaluate our method with a computationally intensive but "gold-standard"retraining from scratch and demonstrate our method's advantages over previousmethods.</description><author>Sheng-Yu Wang, Aaron Hertzmann, Alexei A.

Towards that goal, it is important to understand the 3D reasoningcapabilities of current models as well as identify the gaps between thesemodels and humans. Therefore, we construct a new 3D visual understandingbenchmark named UniQA-3D. UniQA-3D covers fundamental 3D vision tasks in theVisual Question Answering (VQA) format. We evaluate state-of-the-artVision-Language Models (VLMs), specialized models, and human subjects on it.Our results show that VLMs generally perform poorly, while the specializedmodels are accurate but not robust, failing under geometric perturbations. Incontrast, human vision continues to be the most reliable 3D visual system. Wefurther demonstrate that neural networks align more closely with human 3Dvision mechanisms compared to classical computer vision methods, andTransformer-based networks such as ViT align more closely with human 3D visionmechanisms than CNNs. We hope our study will benefit the future development offoundation models for 3D vision.

Most existing methods rely on depth estimationthrough self-supervision or multi-modality sensor fusion. In this paper, wepropose Driv3R, a DUSt3R-based framework that directly regresses per-framepoint maps from multi-view image sequences. To achieve streaming densereconstruction, we maintain a memory pool to reason both spatial relationshipsacross sensors and dynamic temporal contexts to enhance multi-view 3Dconsistency and temporal integration. Furthermore, we employ a 4D flowpredictor to identify moving objects within the scene to direct our networkfocus more on reconstructing these dynamic regions. Finally, we align allper-frame pointmaps consistently to the world coordinate system in anoptimization-free manner. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scalenuScenes dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Driv3Routperforms previous frameworks in 4D dynamic scene reconstruction, achieving15x faster inference speed compared to methods requiring global alignment.Code: https://github.com/Barrybarry-Smith/Driv3R.</description><author>Xin Fei, Wenzhao Zheng, Yueqi Duan, Wei Zhan, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Kurt Keutzer, Jiwen Lu</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:58:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06777v1</guid></item><item><title>Delve into Visual Contrastive Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation of Large Vision-Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06775v1</link><description>While large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilitiesin generating plausible responses correlated with input visual contents, theystill suffer from hallucinations, where the generated text inaccuratelyreflects visual contents. To address this, recent approaches apply contrastivedecoding to calibrate the model's response via contrasting output distributionswith original and visually distorted samples, demonstrating promisinghallucination mitigation in a training-free manner. However, the potential ofchanging information in visual inputs is not well-explored, so a deeperinvestigation into the behaviors of visual contrastive decoding is of greatinterest. In this paper, we first explore various methods for contrastivedecoding to change visual contents, including image downsampling and editing.Downsampling images reduces the detailed textual information while editingyields new contents in images, providing new aspects as visual contrastivesamples. To further study benefits by using different contrastive samples, weanalyze probability-level metrics, including entropy and distribution distance.Interestingly, the effect of these samples in mitigating hallucinations variesa lot across LVLMs and benchmarks. Based on our analysis, we propose a simpleyet effective method to combine contrastive samples, offering a practicalsolution for applying contrastive decoding across various scenarios. Extensiveexperiments are conducted to validate the proposed fusion method amongdifferent benchmarks.</description><author>Yi-Lun Lee, Yi-Hsuan Tsai, Wei-Chen Chiu</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:57:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06775v1</guid></item><item><title>SCADE: Scalable Framework for Anomaly Detection in High-Performance System</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04259v2</link><description>As command-line interfaces remain integral to high-performance computingenvironments, the risk of exploitation through stealthy and complexcommand-line abuse grows. Conventional security solutions struggle to detectthese anomalies due to their context-specific nature, lack of labeled data, andthe prevalence of sophisticated attacks like Living-off-the-Land (LOL). Toaddress this gap, we introduce the Scalable Command-Line Anomaly DetectionEngine (SCADE), a framework that combines global statistical models with localcontext-specific analysis for unsupervised anomaly detection. SCADE leveragesnovel statistical methods, including BM25 and Log Entropy, alongside dynamicthresholding to adaptively detect rare, malicious command-line patterns in lowsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. Experimental results show that SCADEachieves above 98% SNR in identifying anomalous behavior while minimizing falsepositives. Designed for scalability and precision, SCADE provides aninnovative, metadata-enriched approach to anomaly detection, offering a robustsolution for cybersecurity in high-computation environments. This work presentsSCADE's architecture, detection methodology, and its potential for enhancinganomaly detection in enterprise systems. We argue that SCADE represents asignificant advancement in unsupervised anomaly detection, offering a robust,adaptive framework for security analysts and researchers seeking to enhancedetection accuracy in high-computation environments.</description><author>Vaishali Vinay, Anjali Mangal</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:57:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04259v2</guid></item><item><title>Visual Lexicon: Rich Image Features in Language Space</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06774v1</link><description>We present Visual Lexicon, a novel visual language that encodes rich imageinformation into the text space of vocabulary tokens while retaining intricatevisual details that are often challenging to convey in natural language. Unliketraditional methods that prioritize either high-level semantics (e.g., CLIP) orpixel-level reconstruction (e.g., VAE), ViLex simultaneously captures richsemantic content and fine visual details, enabling high-quality imagegeneration and comprehensive visual scene understanding. Through aself-supervised learning pipeline, ViLex generates tokens optimized forreconstructing input images using a frozen text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model,preserving the detailed information necessary for high-fidelity semantic-levelreconstruction. As an image embedding in the language space, ViLex tokensleverage the compositionality of natural languages, allowing them to be usedindependently as "text tokens" or combined with natural language tokens toprompt pretrained T2I models with both visual and textual inputs, mirroring howwe interact with vision-language models (VLMs). Experiments demonstrate thatViLex achieves higher fidelity in image reconstruction compared to textembeddings--even with a single ViLex token. Moreover, ViLex successfullyperforms various DreamBooth tasks in a zero-shot, unsupervised manner withoutfine-tuning T2I models. Additionally, ViLex serves as a powerful visionencoder, consistently improving vision-language model performance across 15benchmarks relative to a strong SigLIP baseline.</description><author>XuDong Wang, Xingyi Zhou, Alireza Fathi, Trevor Darrell, Cordelia Schmid</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:57:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06774v1</guid></item><item><title>Proactive Agents for Multi-Turn Text-to-Image Generation Under Uncertainty</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06771v1</link><description>User prompts for generative AI models are often underspecified, leading tosub-optimal responses. This problem is particularly evident in text-to-image(T2I) generation, where users commonly struggle to articulate their preciseintent. This disconnect between the user's vision and the model'sinterpretation often forces users to painstakingly and repeatedly refine theirprompts. To address this, we propose a design for proactive T2I agents equippedwith an interface to (1) actively ask clarification questions when uncertain,and (2) present their understanding of user intent as an understandable beliefgraph that a user can edit. We build simple prototypes for such agents andverify their effectiveness through both human studies and automated evaluation.We observed that at least 90% of human subjects found these agents and theirbelief graphs helpful for their T2I workflow. Moreover, we develop a scalableautomated evaluation approach using two agents, one with a ground truth imageand the other tries to ask as few questions as possible to align with theground truth. On DesignBench, a benchmark we created for artists and designers,the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014), and ImageInWords (Garg et al., 2024), weobserved that these T2I agents were able to ask informative questions andelicit crucial information to achieve successful alignment with at least 2times higher VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024) than the standard single-turn T2Igeneration.

It is especially challenging in poor lighting and with fastmotion. It is partly due to the limitations of RGB cameras: To capture fastmotion without much blur, the framerate must be increased, which in turnrequires more lighting. In contrast, event cameras, which record changes inpixel brightness asynchronously, are much less dependent on lighting, makingthem more suitable for recording fast motion. We hence propose the first methodto spatiotemporally reconstruct a scene from sparse multi-view event streamsand sparse RGB frames. We train a sequence of cross-faded time-conditioned NeRFmodels, one per short recording segment. The individual segments are supervisedwith a set of event- and RGB-based losses and sparse-view regularisation. Weassemble a real-world multi-view camera rig with six static event camerasaround the object and record a benchmark multi-view event stream dataset ofchallenging motions. Our work outperforms RGB-based baselines, producingstate-of-the-art results, and opens up the topic of multi-view event-basedreconstruction as a new path for fast scene capture beyond RGB cameras.

However, we arguethat language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, mostword tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential forreasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose hugechallenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in anunrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a newparadigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hiddenstate of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed "continuousthought"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to theLLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space.Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on severalreasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergentadvanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiplealternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-firstsearch (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to asingle deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logicalreasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, withfewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promiseof latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.</description><author>Shibo Hao, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, DiJia Su, Xian Li, Zhiting Hu, Jason Weston, Yuandong Tian</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:55:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769v1</guid></item><item><title>MAtCha Gaussians: Atlas of Charts for High-Quality Geometry and Photorealism From Sparse Views</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06767v1</link><description>We present a novel appearance model that simultaneously realizes explicithigh-quality 3D surface mesh recovery and photorealistic novel view synthesisfrom sparse view samples. Our key idea is to model the underlying scenegeometry Mesh as an Atlas of Charts which we render with 2D Gaussian surfels(MAtCha Gaussians). MAtCha distills high-frequency scene surface details froman off-the-shelf monocular depth estimator and refines it through Gaussiansurfel rendering. The Gaussian surfels are attached to the charts on the fly,satisfying photorealism of neural volumetric rendering and crisp geometry of amesh model, i.e., two seemingly contradicting goals in a single model. At thecore of MAtCha lies a novel neural deformation model and a structure loss thatpreserve the fine surface details distilled from learned monocular depths whileaddressing their fundamental scale ambiguities. Results of extensiveexperimental validation demonstrate MAtCha's state-of-the-art quality ofsurface reconstruction and photorealism on-par with top contenders but withdramatic reduction in the number of input views and computational time.

Yet, with text as their only input modality, they cannot leveragethe large body of visual artifacts that engineers have used for centuries andare accustomed to. This gap is addressed with the release of multimodalvision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4V, enabling AI to impact many moretypes of tasks. Our work presents a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs across aspectrum of engineering design tasks, categorized into four main areas:Conceptual Design, System-Level and Detailed Design, Manufacturing andInspection, and Engineering Education Tasks. Specifically in this paper, weassess the capabilities of two VLMs, GPT-4V and LLaVA 1.6 34B, in design taskssuch as sketch similarity analysis, CAD generation, topology optimization,manufacturability assessment, and engineering textbook problems. Through thisstructured evaluation, we not only explore VLMs' proficiency in handlingcomplex design challenges but also identify their limitations in complexengineering design applications.

To address this, we propose an effective yet efficientapproach that reframes the CLIP model into a learning-to-rank task andintroduces a lightweight adapter to augment CLIP for text-guided image ranking.Specifically, our approach incorporates learnable prompts to adapt to newinstructions for ranking purposes and an auxiliary branch with ranking-awareattention, leveraging text-conditioned visual differences for additionalsupervision in image ranking. Our ranking-aware adapter consistentlyoutperforms fine-tuned CLIPs on various tasks and achieves competitive resultscompared to state-of-the-art models designed for specific tasks like facial ageestimation and image quality assessment. Overall, our approach primarilyfocuses on ranking images with a single instruction, which provides a naturaland generalized way of learning from visual differences across images,bypassing the need for extensive text prompts tailored to individual tasks.Code is available: https://github.com/uynaes/RankingAwareCLIP.</description><author>Wei-Hsiang Yu, Yen-Yu Lin, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Yi-Hsuan Tsai</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:51:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06760v1</guid></item><item><title>XRZoo: A Large-Scale and Versatile Dataset of Extended Reality (XR) Applications</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06759v1</link><description>The rapid advancement of Extended Reality (XR, encompassing AR, MR, and VR)and spatial computing technologies forms a foundational layer for the emergingMetaverse, enabling innovative applications across healthcare, education,manufacturing, and entertainment. However, research in this area is oftenlimited by the lack of large, representative, and highquality applicationdatasets that can support empirical studies and the development of newapproaches benefiting XR software processes. In this paper, we introduce XRZoo,a comprehensive and curated dataset of XR applications designed to bridge thisgap. XRZoo contains 12,528 free XR applications, spanning nine app stores,across all XR techniques (i.e., AR, MR, and VR) and use cases, with detailedmetadata on key aspects such as application descriptions, applicationcategories, release dates, user review numbers, and hardware specifications,etc. By making XRZoo publicly available, we aim to foster reproducible XRsoftware engineering and security research, enable cross-disciplinaryinvestigations, and also support the development of advanced XR systems byproviding examples to developers. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource forresearchers and practitioners interested in improving the scalability,usability, and effectiveness of XR applications. XRZoo will be released andactively maintained.</description><author>Shuqing Li, Chenran Zhang, Cuiyun Gao, Michael R.

Despite its growing prominence in various industries,the increasing scale of SR models incurs substantial computational costs andunpredictability, challenging developers to manage resources efficiently. Underthis predicament, Scaling Laws have achieved significant success by examiningthe loss as models scale up. However, there remains a disparity between lossand model performance, which is of greater concern in practical applications.Moreover, as data continues to expand, it incorporates repetitive andinefficient data. In response, we introduce the Performance Law for SR models,which aims to theoretically investigate and model the relationship betweenmodel performance and data quality. Specifically, we first fit the HR and NDCGmetrics to transformer-based SR models. Subsequently, we propose ApproximateEntropy (ApEn) to assess data quality, presenting a more nuanced approachcompared to traditional data quantity metrics. Our method enables accuratepredictions across various dataset scales and model sizes, demonstrating astrong correlation in large SR models and offering insights into achievingoptimal performance for any given model configuration.</description><author>Tingjia Shen, Hao Wang, Chuhan Wu, Jin Yao Chin, Wei Guo, Yong Liu, Huifeng Guo, Defu Lian, Ruiming Tang, Enhong Chen</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:46:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00430v3</guid></item><item><title>InstantRestore: Single-Step Personalized Face Restoration with Shared-Image Attention</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06753v1</link><description>Face image restoration aims to enhance degraded facial images whileaddressing challenges such as diverse degradation types, real-time processingdemands, and, most crucially, the preservation of identity-specific features.Existing methods often struggle with slow processing times and suboptimalrestoration, especially under severe degradation, failing to accuratelyreconstruct finer-level identity details. To address these issues, we introduceInstantRestore, a novel framework that leverages a single-step image diffusionmodel and an attention-sharing mechanism for fast and personalized facerestoration. Additionally, InstantRestore incorporates a novel landmarkattention loss, aligning key facial landmarks to refine the attention maps,enhancing identity preservation. At inference time, given a degraded input anda small (~4) set of reference images, InstantRestore performs a single forwardpass through the network to achieve near real-time performance. Unlike priorapproaches that rely on full diffusion processes or per-identity model tuning,InstantRestore offers a scalable solution suitable for large-scaleapplications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstantRestore outperformsexisting methods in quality and speed, making it an appealing choice foridentity-preserving face restoration.</description><author>Howard Zhang, Yuval Alaluf, Sizhuo Ma, Achuta Kadambi, Jian Wang, Kfir Aberman</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:43:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06753v1</guid></item><item><title>ZS4C: Zero-Shot Synthesis of Compilable Code for Incomplete Code Snippets using LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14279v3</link><description>Technical Q&amp;A sites are valuable for software developers seeking knowledge,but the code snippets they provide are often uncompilable and incomplete due tounresolved types and missing libraries. This poses a challenge for users whowish to reuse or analyze these snippets. Existing methods either do not focuson creating compilable code or have low success rates. To address this, wepropose ZS4C, a lightweight approach for zero-shot synthesis of compilable codefrom incomplete snippets using Large Language Models (LLMs). ZS4C operates intwo stages: first, it uses an LLM, like GPT-3.5, to identify missing importstatements in a snippet; second, it collaborates with a validator (e.g.,compiler) to fix compilation errors caused by incorrect imports and syntaxissues. We evaluated ZS4C on the StatType-SO benchmark and a new dataset,Python-SO, which includes 539 Python snippets from Stack Overflow across the 20most popular Python libraries. ZS4C significantly outperforms existing methods,improving the compilation rate from 63% to 95.1% compared to thestate-of-the-art SnR, marking a 50.1% improvement.

We may want models to output refusal messages for various categoriesof user queries, for example, ill-posed questions, instructions for committingillegal acts, or queries which require information past the model's knowledgehorizon. Engineering models that refuse to answer such questions is complicatedby the fact that an individual may want their model to exhibit varying levelsof sensitivity for refusing queries of various categories, and different usersmay want different refusal rates. The current default approach involvestraining multiple models with varying proportions of refusal messages from eachcategory to achieve the desired refusal rates, which is computationallyexpensive and may require training a new model to accommodate each user'sdesired preference over refusal rates. To address these challenges, we proposerefusal tokens, one such token for each refusal category or a single refusaltoken, which are prepended to the model's responses during training. We thenshow how to increase or decrease the probability of generating the refusaltoken for each category during inference to steer the model's refusal behavior.Refusal tokens enable controlling a single model's refusal rates without theneed of any further fine-tuning, but only by selectively intervening duringgeneration.</description><author>Neel Jain, Aditya Shrivastava, Chenyang Zhu, Daben Liu, Alfy Samuel, Ashwinee Panda, Anoop Kumar, Micah Goldblum, Tom Goldstein</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:40:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06748v1</guid></item><item><title>Croissant: A Metadata Format for ML-Ready Datasets</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19546v3</link><description>Data is a critical resource for machine learning (ML), yet working with dataremains a key friction point.

Results includedcomparisons to more conventional docking approaches, with DiffDock showingsuperior performance. Here, we employ a fully automatic workflow using theSurflex-Dock methods to generate a fair baseline for conventional dockingapproaches. Results were generated for the common and expected situation wherea binding site location is known and also for the condition of an unknownbinding site. For the known binding site condition, Surflex-Dock success ratesat 2.0 Angstroms RMSD far exceeded those for DiffDock (Top-1/Top-5 successrates, respectively, were 68/81% compared with 45/51%). Glide performed withsimilar success rates (67/73%) to Surflex-Dock for the known binding sitecondition, and results for AutoDock Vina and Gnina followed this pattern. Forthe unknown binding site condition, using an automated method to identifymultiple binding pockets, Surflex-Dock success rates again exceeded those ofDiffDock, but by a somewhat lesser margin. DiffDock made use of roughly 17,000co-crystal structures for learning (98% of PDBBind version 2020, pre-2019structures) for a training set in order to predict on 363 test cases (2% ofPDBBind 2020) from 2019 forward. DiffDock's performance was inextricably linkedwith the presence of near-neighbor cases of close to identical protein-ligandcomplexes in the training set for over half of the test set cases. DiffDockexhibited a 40 percentage point difference on near-neighbor cases (two-thirdsof all test cases) compared with cases with no near-neighbor training case.DiffDock has apparently encoded a type of table-lookup during its learningprocess, rendering meaningful applications beyond its reach. Further, it doesnot perform even close to competitively with a competently run modern dockingworkflow.</description><author>Ajay N. Jain, Ann E. Cleves, W.

To address this, we propose ONEBench(OpeN-EndedBenchmarking), a new testing paradigm that consolidates individual evaluationdatasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. ONEBench allows users togenerate custom, open-ended evaluation benchmarks from this pool, correspondingto specific capabilities of interest. By aggregating samples across test sets,ONEBench enables the assessment of diverse capabilities beyond those covered bythe original test sets, while mitigating overfitting and dataset bias. Mostimportantly, it frames model evaluation as a collective process of selectingand aggregating sample-level tests. The shift from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces twochallenges: (1)heterogeneity and (2)incompleteness. Heterogeneity refers to theaggregation over diverse metrics, while incompleteness describes comparingmodels evaluated on different data subsets. To address these challenges, weexplore algorithms to aggregate sparse measurements into reliable model scores.Our aggregation algorithm ensures identifiability(asymptotically recoveringground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model rankingwith less data. On homogenous datasets, we show our aggregation algorithmprovides rankings that highly correlate with those produced by average scores.We also demonstrate robustness to ~95% of measurements missing, reducingevaluation cost by up to 20x with little-to-no change in model rankings. Weintroduce ONEBench-LLM for language models and ONEBench-LMM for vision-languagemodels, unifying evaluations across these domains. Overall, we present atechnique for open-ended evaluation, which can aggregate over incomplete,heterogeneous sample-level measurements to continually grow a benchmarkalongside the rapidly developing foundation models.</description><author>Adhiraj Ghosh, Sebastian Dziadzio, Ameya Prabhu, Vishaal Udandarao, Samuel Albanie, Matthias Bethge</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:37:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06745v1</guid></item><item><title>3D Graph Attention Networks for High Fidelity Pediatric Glioma Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06743v1</link><description>Pediatric brain tumors, particularly gliomas, represent a significant causeof cancer related mortality in children with complex infiltrative growthpatterns that complicate treatment.

To fill this gap, wefirst conduct an in-depth analysis of the vulnerability of AIGC detectors anddiscover the feature that detectors vary in vulnerability to differentpost-processing. Then, considering the uncertainty of detectors in real-worldscenarios, and based on the discovery, we propose a Realistic-like RobustBlack-box Adversarial attack (R$^2$BA) with post-processing fusionoptimization. Unlike typical perturbations, R$^2$BA uses real-worldpost-processing, i.e., Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, Gaussian noise andlight spot to generate adversarial examples. Specifically, we use a stochasticparticle swarm algorithm with inertia decay to optimize post-processing fusionintensity and explore the detector's decision boundary.

However, existing MEL methods typically utilize mentionwords as mentions for retrieval. This results in a significant dependence ofMEL on mention words, thereby constraining its capacity to effectively leverageinformation from both images and text. In situations where mention words areabsent, MEL methods struggle to leverage image-text pairs for entity linking.To solve these issues, we introduce a Visual Prompts guided Multimodal EntityLinking (VP-MEL) task. VP-MEL directly marks specific regions within the image.These markers are referred to as visual prompts in VP-MEL. Without mentionwords, VP-MEL aims to utilize marked image-text pairs to align visual promptswith specific entities in the knowledge bases.

Since these candegrade the quality of the user's experience, it is important to automaticallyand accurately detect them in order to enable effective quality measurement andenhancement. Existing detection methods often focus on a single type ofartifact and/or determine the presence of an artifact through thresholdingobjective quality indices. Such approaches have been reported to offerinconsistent prediction performance and are also impractical for real-worldapplications where multiple artifacts co-exist and interact. In this paper, wepropose a Multiple Visual Artifact Detector, MVAD, for video streaming which,for the first time, is able to detect multiple artifacts using a singleframework that is not reliant on video quality assessment models. Our approachemploys a new Artifact-aware Dynamic Feature Extractor (ADFE) to obtainartifact-relevant spatial features within each frame for multiple artifacttypes. The extracted features are further processed by a Recurrent MemoryVision Transformer (RMViT) module, which captures both short-term and long-termtemporal information within the input video. The proposed network architectureis optimized in an end-to-end manner based on a new, large and diverse trainingdatabase that is generated by simulating the video streaming pipeline and basedon Adversarial Data Augmentation. This model has been evaluated on two videoartifact databases, Maxwell and BVI-Artifact, and achieves consistent andimproved prediction results for ten target visual artifacts when compared toseven existing single and multiple artifact detectors.

This studydevelops deep learning (DL) models to detect Bankart lesions on both standardMRIs and MRAs, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce reliance onMRAs. We curated a dataset of 586 shoulder MRIs (335 standard, 251 MRAs) from558 patients who underwent arthroscopy. Ground truth labels were derived fromintraoperative findings, the gold standard for Bankart lesion diagnosis.Separate DL models for MRAs and standard MRIs were trained using the SwinTransformer architecture, pre-trained on a public knee MRI dataset. Predictionsfrom sagittal, axial, and coronal views were ensembled to optimize performance.The models were evaluated on a 20% hold-out test set (117 MRIs: 46 MRAs, 71standard MRIs). Bankart lesions were identified in 31.9% of MRAs and 8.6% ofstandard MRIs. The models achieved AUCs of 0.87 (86% accuracy, 83% sensitivity,86% specificity) and 0.90 (85% accuracy, 82% sensitivity, 86% specificity) onstandard MRIs and MRAs, respectively. These results match or surpassradiologist performance on our dataset and reported literature metrics.Notably, our model's performance on non-invasive standard MRIs matched orsurpassed the radiologists interpreting MRAs. This study demonstrates thefeasibility of using DL to address the diagnostic challenges posed by subtlepathologies like Bankart lesions. Our models demonstrate potential to improvediagnostic confidence, reduce reliance on invasive imaging, and enhanceaccessibility to care.</description><author>Sahil Sethi, Sai Reddy, Mansi Sakarvadia, Jordan Serotte, Darlington Nwaudo, Nicholas Maassen, Lewis Shi</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:04:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06717v1</guid></item><item><title>ALEN: An Adaptive Dual-Approach for Enhancing Uniform and Non-Uniform Low-Light Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19708v2</link><description>Low-light image enhancement is vital for improving the visibility and qualityof images captured under suboptimal lighting conditions. Traditional methodsoften fail to adequately capture local lighting variations and enhance bothtextural and chromatic details. Recent deep learning-based approaches, whileeffective, still struggle with generalization across diverse datasets, leadingto noise amplification and unnatural color saturation. To address thesechallenges, the Adaptive Light Enhancement Network (ALEN) is introduced, anovel method that utilizes a classification mechanism to determine whetherlocal or global illumination enhancement is required. ALEN integrates the SwinLight-Classification Transformer (SLCformer) for illuminance categorization,complemented by the Single-Channel Network (SCNet) and Multi-Channel Network(MCNet) for precise illumination and color estimation, respectively. Extensiveexperiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate ALEN's robustgeneralization capabilities, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in bothquantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Furthermore, ALEN not onlyenhances image quality but also improves the performance of high-level visiontasks such as semantic segmentation, showcasing its broader applicability andpotential impact.

However, most existing model merging approaches assume that all expertsare available simultaneously. In reality, new tasks and domains emergeprogressively over time, requiring strategies to integrate the knowledge ofexpert models as they become available: a process we call temporal modelmerging. The temporal dimension introduces unique challenges not addressed inprior work, raising new questions such as: when training for a new task, shouldthe expert model start from the merged past experts or from the original basemodel? Should we merge all models at each time step? Which merging techniquesare best suited for temporal merging? Should different strategies be used toinitialize the training and deploy the model? To answer these questions, wepropose a unified framework called TIME - Temporal Integration of ModelExpertise - which defines temporal model merging across three axes: (1)Initialization Phase, (2) Deployment Phase, and (3) Merging Technique. UsingTIME, we study temporal model merging across model sizes, compute budgets, andlearning horizons on the FoMo-in-Flux benchmark. Our comprehensive suite ofexperiments across TIME allows us to uncover key insights for temporal modelmerging, offering a better understanding of current challenges and bestpractices for effective temporal model merging.</description><author>Sebastian Dziadzio, Vishaal Udandarao, Karsten Roth, Ameya Prabhu, Zeynep Akata, Samuel Albanie, Matthias Bethge</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:01:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06712v1</guid></item><item><title>MISFEAT: Feature Selection for Subgroups with Systematic Missing Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06711v1</link><description>We investigate the problem of selecting features for datasets that can benaturally partitioned into subgroups (e.g., according to socio-demographicgroups and age), each with its own dominant set of features. Within thissubgroup-oriented framework, we address the challenge of systematic missingdata, a scenario in which some feature values are missing for all tuples of asubgroup, due to flawed data integration, regulatory constraints, or privacyconcerns. Feature selection is governed by finding mutual Information, apopular quantification of correlation, between features and a target variable.Our goal is to identify top-K feature subsets of some fixed size with thehighest joint mutual information with a target variable. In the presence ofsystematic missing data, the closed form of mutual information could not simplybe applied. We argue that in such a setting, leveraging relationships betweenavailable feature mutual information within a subgroup or across subgroups canassist inferring missing mutual information values. We propose a generalizablemodel based on heterogeneous graph neural network to identify interdependenciesbetween feature-subgroup-target variable connections by modeling it as amultiplex graph, and employing information propagation between its nodes.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative conditioncharacterized by the deterioration of brain function. In the initial stages ofPD, automatic diagnosis poses a challenge due to the similarity in behaviorbetween individuals with PD and those who are healthy. Our objective is topropose an effective model that can aid in the early detection of Parkinson'sdisease. We employed the VGRF gait signal dataset sourced from Physionet fordistinguishing between healthy individuals and those diagnosed with Parkinson'sdisease. This paper introduces a novel deep learning architecture based on theLSTM network for automatically detecting freezing of gait episodes inParkinson's disease patients. In contrast to conventional machine learningalgorithms, this method eliminates manual feature engineering and proficientlycaptures prolonged temporal dependencies in gait patterns, thereby improvingthe diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The LSTM network resolves the issue ofvanishing gradients by employing memory blocks in place of self-connectedhidden units, allowing for optimal information assimilation. To preventoverfitting, dropout and L2 regularization techniques have been employed.Additionally, the stochastic gradient-based optimizer Adam is used for theoptimization process. The results indicate that our proposed approach surpassescurrent state-of-the-art models in FOG episode detection, achieving an accuracyof 97.71%, sensitivity of 99%, precision of 98%, and specificity of 96%.

Existing event-based object detection methods, however,are limited by fixed-frequency paradigms and fail to fully exploit thehigh-temporal resolution and adaptability of event cameras. To address theselimitations, we propose FlexEvent, a novel event camera object detectionframework that enables detection at arbitrary frequencies. Our approachconsists of two key components: FlexFuser, an adaptive event-frame fusionmodule that integrates high-frequency event data with rich semantic informationfrom RGB frames, and FAL, a frequency-adaptive learning mechanism thatgenerates frequency-adjusted labels to enhance model generalization acrossvarying operational frequencies. This combination allows our method to detectobjects with high accuracy in both fast-moving and static scenarios, whileadapting to dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on large-scale eventcamera datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-artmethods, achieving significant improvements in both standard and high-frequencysettings. Notably, our method maintains robust performance when scaling from 20Hz to 90 Hz and delivers accurate detection up to 180 Hz, proving itseffectiveness in extreme conditions.

However, their performance isupper-bounded by constrained 3D priors due to the lack of scalable learningparadigms. In this work, we present See3D, a visual-conditional multi-viewdiffusion model trained on large-scale Internet videos for open-world 3Dcreation. The model aims to Get 3D knowledge by solely Seeing the visualcontents from the vast and rapidly growing video data -- You See it, You Gotit. To achieve this, we first scale up the training data using a proposed datacuration pipeline that automatically filters out multi-view inconsistencies andinsufficient observations from source videos. This results in a high-quality,richly diverse, large-scale dataset of multi-view images, termed WebVi3D,containing 320M frames from 16M video clips. Nevertheless, learning generic 3Dpriors from videos without explicit 3D geometry or camera pose annotations isnontrivial, and annotating poses for web-scale videos is prohibitivelyexpensive. To eliminate the need for pose conditions, we introduce aninnovative visual-condition - a purely 2D-inductive visual signal generated byadding time-dependent noise to the masked video data. Finally, we introduce anovel visual-conditional 3D generation framework by integrating See3D into awarping-based pipeline for high-fidelity 3D generation. Our numerical andvisual comparisons on single and sparse reconstruction benchmarks show thatSee3D, trained on cost-effective and scalable video data, achieves notablezero-shot and open-world generation capabilities, markedly outperforming modelstrained on costly and constrained 3D datasets.

Due to its ill-posed nature, recentworks leverage powerful prior from 2D diffusion models pretrained on largedatasets. Although 2D diffusion models demonstrate strong generalizationcapability, they cannot guarantee the generated multi-view images are 3Dconsistent. In this paper, we propose Gen-3Diffusion: Realistic Image-to-3DGeneration via 2D &amp; 3D Diffusion Synergy. We leverage a pre-trained 2Ddiffusion model and a 3D diffusion model via our elegantly designed processthat synchronizes two diffusion models at both training and sampling time. Thesynergy between the 2D and 3D diffusion models brings two major advantages: 1)2D helps 3D in generalization: the pretrained 2D model has stronggeneralization ability to unseen images, providing strong shape priors for the3D diffusion model; 2) 3D helps 2D in multi-view consistency: the 3D diffusionmodel enhances the 3D consistency of 2D multi-view sampling process, resultingin more accurate multi-view generation. We validate our idea through extensiveexperiments in image-based objects and clothed avatar generation tasks. Resultsshow that our method generates realistic 3D objects and avatars withhigh-fidelity geometry and texture.

The use of sCT enables the calculation ofdoses, pushing towards Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guided radiotherapytreatments. Moreover, with the introduction of MRI-Positron Emission Tomography(PET) hybrid scanners, the derivation of sCT from MRI can improve theattenuation correction of PET images.

In the case of the unseen centre, the federated model achieved a median MeanAbsolute Error (MAE) of 102.0 HU across 23 patients, with an interquartilerange of 96.7-110.5 HU. The median (interquartile range) for the StructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) and the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PNSR) were 0.89(0.86-0.89) and 26.58 (25.52-27.42), respectively.

While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise forsimpler manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g.,the object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability whenhandling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduceDexDiffuser, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptivedexterous manipulation. DexDiffuser models joint state-action dynamics througha dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contactalignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptivegeneralizable dexterous manipulation.

While imitation learning discards non-expert data, reinforcementlearning (RL) can still learn from suboptimal data. However, instantiating RLtraining of a new policy class often presents a different challenge: most deepRL machinery is co-developed with assumptions on the policy class and backbone,resulting in poor performance when the policy class changes. For instance, SACutilizes a low-variance reparameterization policy gradient for Gaussianpolicies, but this is unstable for diffusion policies and intractable forautoregressive categorical policies. To address this issue, we develop anoffline RL and online fine-tuning approach called policy-agnostic RL (PA-RL)that can effectively train multiple policy classes, with varying architecturesand sizes. We build off the basic idea that a universal supervised learningloss can replace the policy improvement step in RL, as long as it is applied on"optimized" actions. To obtain these optimized actions, we first samplemultiple actions from a base policy, and run global optimization (i.e.,re-ranking multiple action samples using the Q-function) and local optimization(i.e., running gradient steps on an action sample) to maximize the critic onthese candidates. PA-RL enables fine-tuning diffusion and transformer policieswith either autoregressive tokens or continuous action outputs, at differentsizes, entirely via actor-critic RL. Moreover, PA-RL improves the performanceand sample-efficiency by up to 2 times compared to existing offline RL andonline fine-tuning methods. We show the first result that successfullyfine-tunes OpenVLA, a 7B generalist robot policy, autonomously with Cal-QL, anonline RL fine-tuning algorithm, improving from 40% to 70% in the real world in40 minutes.</description><author>Max Sobol Mark, Tian Gao, Georgia Gabriela Sampaio, Mohan Kumar Srirama, Archit Sharma, Chelsea Finn, Aviral Kumar</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 17:28:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06685v1</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Critical Testing Scenarios for Decision-Making Policies: An LLM Approach</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06684v1</link><description>Recent years have witnessed surprising achievements of decision-makingpolicies across various fields, such as autonomous driving and robotics.Testing for decision-making policies is crucial with the existence of criticalscenarios that may threaten their reliability. Numerous research efforts havebeen dedicated to testing these policies. However, there are still significantchallenges, such as low testing efficiency and diversity due to the complexityof the policies and environments under test. Inspired by the remarkablecapabilities of large language models (LLMs), in this paper, we propose anLLM-driven online testing framework for efficiently testing decision-makingpolicies. The main idea is to employ an LLM-based test scenario generator tointelligently generate challenging test cases through contemplation andreasoning. Specifically, we first design a "generate-test-feedback" pipelineand apply templated prompt engineering to fully leverage the knowledge andreasoning abilities of LLMs. Then, we introduce a multi-scale scenariogeneration strategy to address the inherent challenges LLMs face in making fineadjustments, further enhancing testing efficiency. Finally, we evaluate theLLM-driven approach on five widely used benchmarks. The experimental resultsdemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches inuncovering both critical and diverse scenarios.</description><author>Weichao Xu, Huaxin Pei, Jingxuan Yang, Yuchen Shi, Yi Zhang</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 17:27:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06684v1</guid></item><item><title>Toward LLM-Agent-Based Modeling of Transportation Systems: A Conceptual Framework</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06681v1</link><description>In transportation system demand modeling and simulation, agent-based modelsand microsimulations are current state-of-the-art approaches.

Thispaper introduces a novel multi-modal deep learning framework namedFlow-Attention Adaptive Semantic Hierarchical Fusion (FLAASH) designed toanalyze tobacco-related video content comprehensively. FLAASH addresses thecomplexities of integrating visual and textual information in short-form videosby leveraging a hierarchical fusion mechanism inspired by flow network theory.Our approach incorporates three key innovations, including a flow-attentionmechanism that captures nuanced interactions between visual and textualmodalities, an adaptive weighting scheme that balances the contribution ofdifferent hierarchical levels, and a gating mechanism that selectivelyemphasizes relevant features. This multi-faceted approach enables FLAASH toeffectively process and analyze diverse tobacco-related content, from productshowcases to usage scenarios.

Ourgoal is to set up the new frontier of the 5M magnitude lightweight model onvarious downstream tasks. Inverted Residual Block (IRB) serves as theinfrastructure for lightweight CNNs, but no counterparts have been recognizedby attention-based design. Our work rethinks the lightweight infrastructure ofefficient IRB and practical components in Transformer from a unifiedperspective, extending CNN-based IRB to attention-based models and abstractinga one-residual Meta Mobile Block (MMBlock) for lightweight model design.Following neat but effective design criterion, we deduce a modern ImprovedInverted Residual Mobile Block (i2RMB) and improve a hierarchical EfficientMOdel (EMOv2) with no elaborate complex structures. Considering theimperceptible latency for mobile users when downloading models under 4G/5Gbandwidth and ensuring model performance, we investigate the performance upperlimit of lightweight models with a magnitude of 5M. Extensive experiments onvarious vision recognition, dense prediction, and image generation tasksdemonstrate the superiority of our EMOv2 over state-of-the-art methods, e.g.,EMOv2-1M/2M/5M achieve 72.3, 75.8, and 79.4 Top-1 that surpass equal-orderCNN-/Attention-based models significantly. At the same time, EMOv2-5M equippedRetinaNet achieves 41.5 mAP for object detection tasks that surpasses theprevious EMO-5M by +2.6.

We apply distributed Thompson sampling, using a Gaussianprocess as a surrogate model, to approach the multi-agent Bayesian optimizationproblem. In our distributed Thompson sampling implementation, each agentreceives sampled points from neighbors, where the communication network isencoded in a graph; each agent utilizes their own Gaussian process to model theobjective function. We demonstrate theoretical bounds on Bayesian simple regretand Bayesian average regret, where the bound depends on the structure of thecommunication graph. Unlike in batch Bayesian optimization, this bound isapplicable in cases where the communication graph amongst agents isconstrained. When compared to sequential single-agent Thompson sampling, ourbound guarantees faster convergence with respect to time as long as thecommunication graph is connected. We confirm the efficacy of our algorithm withnumerical simulations on traditional optimization test functions, illustratingthe significance of graph connectivity on improving regret convergence.</description><author>Saba Zerefa, Zhaolin Ren, Haitong Ma, Na Li</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 17:12:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15543v2</guid></item><item><title>ILLUME: Illuminating Your LLMs to See, Draw, and Self-Enhance</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06673v1</link><description>In this paper, we introduce ILLUME, a unified multimodal large language model(MLLM) that seamlessly integrates multimodal understanding and generationcapabilities within a single large language model through a unified next-tokenprediction formulation. To address the large dataset size typically requiredfor image-text alignment, we propose to enhance data efficiency through thedesign of a vision tokenizer that incorporates semantic information and aprogressive multi-stage training procedure. This approach reduces the datasetsize to just 15M for pretraining -- over four times fewer than what istypically needed -- while achieving competitive or even superior performancewith existing unified MLLMs, such as Janus. Additionally, to promotesynergistic enhancement between understanding and generation capabilities,which is under-explored in previous works, we introduce a novel self-enhancingmultimodal alignment scheme. This scheme supervises the MLLM to self-assess theconsistency between text descriptions and self-generated images, facilitatingthe model to interpret images more accurately and avoid unrealistic andincorrect predictions caused by misalignment in image generation.

However, the repetitivedenoising process is computationally intensive during inference, which rendersDiffusion models less suitable for real-world applications that require lowlatency and scalability. Recent studies have employed post-trainingquantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) methods to compressDiffusion models. Nevertheless, prior research has often neglected to examinethe consistency between results generated by quantized models and those fromfloating-point models. This consistency is crucial in fields such as contentcreation, design, and edge deployment, as it can significantly enhance bothefficiency and system stability for practitioners. To ensure that quantizedmodels generate high-quality and consistent images, we propose an efficientquantization framework for Stable Diffusion models. Our approach features aSerial-to-Parallel calibration pipeline that addresses the consistency of boththe calibration and inference processes, as well as ensuring trainingstability.

For each state and action, thisintrinsic reward is the relative entropy of the discounted distribution ofstates and actions (or features from these states and actions) visited duringthe next time steps. We first prove that an optimal exploration policy, whichmaximizes the expected discounted sum of intrinsic rewards, is also a policythat maximizes a lower bound on the state-action value function of the decisionprocess under some assumptions. We also prove that the visitation distributionused in the intrinsic reward definition is the fixed point of a contractionoperator. Following, we describe how to adapt existing algorithms to learn thisfixed point and compute the intrinsic rewards to enhance exploration. A newpractical off-policy maximum entropy reinforcement learning algorithm isfinally introduced.

A comparison between human and LLM labelling</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16851v2</link><description>Quickly detecting problematic research articles is crucial to safeguardingthe integrity of scientific research. This study explores whether Twittermentions of retracted articles can signal potential problems with the articlesprior to their retraction, potentially serving as an early warning system forscholars. To investigate this, we analysed a dataset of 4,354 Twitter mentionsassociated with 504 retracted articles. The effectiveness of Twitter mentionsin predicting article retractions was evaluated by both manual and LargeLanguage Model (LLM) labelling. Manual labelling results indicated that 25.7%of tweets signalled problems before retraction. Using the manual labellingresults as the baseline, we found that LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5 Flash, andClaude-3.5-Haiku) outperformed lexicon-based sentiment analysis tools (e.g.,TextBlob) in detecting potential problems, suggesting that automatic detectionof problematic articles from social media using LLMs is technically feasible.Nevertheless, since only a small proportion of retracted articles (11.1%) werecriticised on Twitter prior to retraction, such automatic systems would detectonly a minority of problematic articles. Overall, this study offers insightsinto how social media data, coupled with emerging generative AI techniques, cansupport research integrity.</description><author>Er-Te Zheng, Hui-Zhen Fu, Mike Thelwall, Zhichao Fang</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 16:42:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16851v2</guid></item><item><title>Extraction Propagation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15883v4</link><description>Running backpropagation end to end on large neural networks is fraught withdifficulties like vanishing gradients and degradation.

Current detectors leverage spikingneural networks, Transformers, or convolutional neural networks as their corearchitectures, each with its own set of limitations including restrictedperformance, high computational overhead, or limited local receptive fields.This paper introduces a novel MoE (Mixture of Experts) heat conduction-basedobject detection algorithm that strikingly balances accuracy and computationalefficiency. Initially, we employ a stem network for event data embedding,followed by processing through our innovative MoE-HCO blocks. Each blockintegrates various expert modules to mimic heat conduction within eventstreams. Subsequently, an IoU-based query selection module is utilized forefficient token extraction, which is then channeled into a detection head forthe final object detection process. Furthermore, we are pleased to introduceEvDET200K, a novel benchmark dataset for event-based object detection. Capturedwith a high-definition Prophesee EVK4-HD event camera, this dataset encompasses10 distinct categories, 200,000 bounding boxes, and 10,054 samples, eachspanning 2 to 5 seconds. We also provide comprehensive results from over 15state-of-the-art detectors, offering a solid foundation for future research andcomparison.

Thisstudy investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) handle image-understandingtasks, specifically focusing on how visual information is processed andtransferred to the textual domain. We compare VLMs that generate both imagesand text with those that output only text, highlighting key differences ininformation flow. We find that in models with multimodal outputs, image andtext embeddings are more separated within the residual stream. Additionally,models vary in how information is exchanged from visual to textual tokens. VLMsthat only output text exhibit a distributed communication pattern, whereinformation is exchanged through multiple image tokens. In contrast, modelstrained for image and text generation rely on a single token that acts as anarrow gate for the visual information. We demonstrate that ablating thissingle token significantly deteriorates performance on image understandingtasks. Furthermore, modifying this token enables effective steering of theimage semantics, showing that targeted, local interventions can reliablycontrol the model's global behavior.</description><author>Alessandro Serra, Francesco Ortu, Emanuele Panizon, Lucrezia Valeriani, Lorenzo Basile, Alessio Ansuini, Diego Doimo, Alberto Cazzaniga</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 16:39:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06646v1</guid></item><item><title>Detecting Facial Image Manipulations with Multi-Layer CNN Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06643v1</link><description>The rapid evolution of digital image manipulation techniques posessignificant challenges for content verification, with models such as stablediffusion and mid-journey producing highly realistic, yet synthetic, imagesthat can deceive human perception. This research develops and evaluatesconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) specifically tailored for the detection ofthese manipulated images.

Nevertheless, theheuristic few-shot annotations may not always cover the most informativesamples, which largely restricts the capability of incremental learner. We aimto start from a pool of large-scale unlabeled data and then annotate the mostinformative samples for incremental learning. Based on this premise, this paperintroduces the Active Class-Incremental Learning (ACIL). The objective of ACILis to select the most informative samples from the unlabeled pool toeffectively train an incremental learner, aiming to maximize the performance ofthe resulting model. Note that vanilla active learning algorithms suffer fromclass-imbalanced distribution among annotated samples, which restricts theability of incremental learning. To achieve both class balance andinformativeness in chosen samples, we propose Class-Balanced Selection (CBS)strategy. Specifically, we first cluster the features of all unlabeled imagesinto multiple groups. Then for each cluster, we employ greedy selectionstrategy to ensure that the Gaussian distribution of the sampled featuresclosely matches the Gaussian distribution of all unlabeled features within thecluster. Our CBS can be plugged and played into those CIL methods which arebased on pretrained models with prompts tunning technique. Extensiveexperiments under ACIL protocol across five diverse datasets demonstrate thatCBS outperforms both random selection and other SOTA active learningapproaches.

Motivated by this, we investigate the internalmechanisms that underpin a network's ability to perform complex logicalreasoning. We first construct a synthetic propositional logic problem thatserves as a concrete test-bed for network training and evaluation. Crucially,this problem demands nontrivial planning to solve. We perform our study on twofronts. First, we pursue an understanding of precisely how a three-layertransformer, trained from scratch and attains perfect test accuracy, solvesthis problem. We are able to identify certain "planning" and "reasoning"mechanisms in the network that necessitate cooperation between the attentionblocks to implement the desired logic. Second, we study how pretrained LLMs,namely Mistral-7B and Gemma-2-9B, solve this problem. We characterize theirreasoning circuits through causal intervention experiments, providing necessityand sufficiency evidence for the circuits. We find evidence suggesting that thetwo models' latent reasoning strategies are surprisingly similar, andhuman-like.

Diverse training protocols oftenresult in significantly different feature spaces, which are usually comparedthrough alignment analysis. However, current alignment measures quantify thisrelationship in terms of a single scalar value, obscuring the distinctionsbetween common and unique features in pairs of representations that share thesame scalar alignment. We address this limitation by combining alignmentanalysis with concept discovery, which enables a breakdown of alignment intosingle concepts encoded in feature space. This fine-grained comparison revealsboth universal and unique concepts across different representations, as well asthe internal structure of concepts within each of them. Our methodologicalcontributions address two key prerequisites for concept-based alignment: 1) Fora description of the representation in terms of concepts that faithfullycapture the geometry of the feature space, we define concepts as the mostgeneral structure they can possibly form - arbitrary manifolds, allowing hiddenfeatures to be described by their proximity to these manifolds. 2) To measuredistances between concept proximity scores of two representations, we use ageneralized Rand index and partition it for alignment between pairs ofconcepts. We confirm the superiority of our novel concept definition foralignment analysis over existing linear baselines in a sanity check. Theconcept-based alignment analysis of representations from four different ViTsreveals that increased supervision correlates with a reduction in the semanticstructure of learned representations.</description><author>Johanna Vielhaben, Dilyara Bareeva, Jim Berend, Wojciech Samek, Nils Strodthoff</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 16:33:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06639v1</guid></item><item><title>RARE: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement for Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02830v3</link><description>This work introduces RARE (Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement), aversatile extension to the mutual reasoning framework (rStar), aimed atenhancing reasoning accuracy and factual integrity across large language models(LLMs) for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks such as commonsense and medicalreasoning. RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo TreeSearch (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on theinitial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries,and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer;and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generatedsub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextualinformation.

Existing bias mitigationmethods focus on a small set of predefined biases, limiting their applicabilityin visual datasets where multiple, possibly unknown biases exist. To addressthis limitation, we introduce MAVias, an open-set bias mitigation approachleveraging foundation models to discover spurious associations between visualattributes and target classes. MAVias first captures a wide variety of visualfeatures in natural language via a foundation image tagging model, and thenleverages a large language model to select those visual features defining thetarget class, resulting in a set of language-coded potential visual biases. Wethen translate this set of potential biases into vision-language embeddings andintroduce an in-processing bias mitigation approach to prevent the model fromencoding information related to them. Our experiments on diverse datasets,including CelebA, Waterbirds, ImageNet, and UrbanCars, show that MAViaseffectively detects and mitigates a wide range of biases in visual recognitiontasks outperforming current state-of-the-art.</description><author>Ioannis Sarridis, Christos Koutlis, Symeon Papadopoulos, Christos Diou</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 16:23:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06632v1</guid></item><item><title>PolytopeWalk: Sparse MCMC Sampling over Polytopes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06629v1</link><description>High dimensional sampling is an important computational tool in statisticsand other computational disciplines, with applications ranging from Bayesianstatistical uncertainty quantification, metabolic modeling in systems biologyto volume computation.

Machine learning (ML) techniques havebeen introduced to assist in VA measurement, potentially alleviatingclinicians' workloads. However, the inherent uncertainties in ML models makerelying solely on them for VA prediction less than ideal. The VA predictiontask involves multiple sources of uncertainty, requiring more robustapproaches. A promising method is to build prediction sets or intervals ratherthan point estimates, offering coverage guarantees through techniques likeconformal prediction and Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) prediction sets.Despite the potential, to date, these approaches have not been applied to theVA prediction task.To address this, we propose a method for deriving predictionintervals for estimating visual acuity from fundus images with a PAC guarantee.Our experimental results demonstrate that the PAC guarantees are upheld, withperformance comparable to or better than that of two prior works that do notprovide such guarantees.</description><author>Sooyong Jang, Kuk Jin Jang, Hyonyoung Choi, Yong-Seop Han, Seongjin Lee, Jin-hyun Kim, Insup Lee</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 16:16:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06624v1</guid></item><item><title>Copyright-Protected Language Generation via Adaptive Model Fusion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06619v1</link><description>The risk of language models reproducing copyrighted material from theirtraining data has led to the development of various protective measures.

Automaticapproaches have proven challenging to align with human preferences, and themixed comparison of text- and image-driven methods often leads to unfairevaluations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework to betteralign and evaluate multi-view diffusion models with human preferences. To beginwith, we first collect and filter a standardized image prompt set fromDALL$\cdot$E and Objaverse, which we then use to generate multi-view assetswith several multi-view diffusion models. Through a systematic ranking pipelineon these assets, we obtain a human annotation dataset with 16k expert pairwisecomparisons and train a reward model, coined MVReward, to effectively encodehuman preferences. With MVReward, image-driven 3D methods can be evaluatedagainst each other in a more fair and transparent manner. Building on this, wefurther propose Multi-View Preference Learning (MVP), a plug-and-playmulti-view diffusion tuning strategy.

This memory burdennecessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limitingtraining scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficientoptimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, theyface critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii)significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) stillsubstantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance. In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can beeffectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on thisinsight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLMOptimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using anauxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. Thisstructured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to furthermemory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Evenits rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performancecompared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par withor better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearlyeliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significantsystem-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GBsetup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes.

These covariates, referred to as biomarkers, areextracted from pre-treatment data, often within randomized controlled trials,and should be distinguished from prognostic biomarkers, which are independentof treatment assignment. Our study focuses on discovering predictive imagingbiomarkers, specific image features, by leveraging pre-treatment images touncover new causal relationships. Unlike labor-intensive approaches relying onhandcrafted features prone to bias, we present a novel task of directlylearning predictive features from images. We propose an evaluation protocol toassess a model's ability to identify predictive imaging biomarkers anddifferentiate them from purely prognostic ones by employing statistical testingand a comprehensive analysis of image feature attribution. We explore thesuitability of deep learning models originally developed for estimating theconditional average treatment effect (CATE) for this task, which have beenassessed primarily for their precision of CATE estimation while overlooking theevaluation of imaging biomarker discovery. Our proof-of-concept analysisdemonstrates the feasibility and potential of our approach in discovering andvalidating predictive imaging biomarkers from synthetic outcomes and real-worldimage datasets.

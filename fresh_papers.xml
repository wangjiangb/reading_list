Recentefforts have aimed to enhance the high-resolution understanding capabilities ofLVLMs, yet they remain capped at approximately 1500 x 1500 pixels andconstrained to a relatively narrow resolution range. This paper representsInternLM-XComposer2-4KHD, a groundbreaking exploration into elevating LVLMresolution capabilities up to 4K HD (3840 x 1600) and beyond. Concurrently,considering the ultra-high resolution may not be necessary in all scenarios, itsupports a wide range of diverse resolutions from 336 pixels to 4K standard,significantly broadening its scope of applicability. Specifically, thisresearch advances the patch division paradigm by introducing a novel extension:dynamic resolution with automatic patch configuration. It maintains thetraining image aspect ratios while automatically varying patch counts andconfiguring layouts based on a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) (336 x336), leading to dynamic training resolution from 336 pixels to 4K standard.Our research demonstrates that scaling training resolution up to 4K HD leads toconsistent performance enhancements without hitting the ceiling of potentialimprovements. InternLM-XComposer2-4KHD shows superb capability that matches oreven surpasses GPT-4V and Gemini Pro in 10 of the 16 benchmarks.

Previous modular methodshave shown promise with a single planning stage ungrounded in visual content.However, through a simple and effective baseline, we find that such systems canlead to brittle behavior in practice for challenging videoQA settings. Thus,unlike traditional single-stage planning methods, we propose a multi-stagesystem consisting of an event parser, a grounding stage, and a final reasoningstage in conjunction with an external memory. All stages are training-free, andperformed using few-shot prompting of large models, creating interpretableintermediate outputs at each stage. By decomposing the underlying planning andtask complexity, our method, MoReVQA, improves over prior work on standardvideoQA benchmarks (NExT-QA, iVQA, EgoSchema, ActivityNet-QA) withstate-of-the-art results, and extensions to related tasks (grounded videoQA,paragraph captioning).</description><author>Juhong Min, Shyamal Buch, Arsha Nagrani, Minsu Cho, Cordelia Schmid</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 18:59:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06511v1</guid></item><item><title>Can Feedback Enhance Semantic Grounding in Large Vision-Language Models?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06510v1</link><description>Enhancing semantic grounding abilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) ofteninvolves collecting domain-specific training data, refining the networkarchitectures, or modifying the training recipes. In this work, we venture intoan orthogonal direction and explore whether VLMs can improve their semanticgrounding by "receiving" feedback, without requiring in-domain data,fine-tuning, or modifications to the network architectures. We systematicallyanalyze this hypothesis using a feedback mechanism composed of a binary signal.We find that if prompted appropriately, VLMs can utilize feedback both in asingle step and iteratively, showcasing the potential of feedback as analternative technique to improve grounding in internet-scale VLMs. Furthermore,VLMs, like LLMs, struggle to self-correct errors out-of-the-box. However, wefind that this issue can be mitigated via a binary verification mechanism.Finally, we explore the potential and limitations of amalgamating thesefindings and applying them iteratively to automatically enhance VLMs' groundingperformance, showing grounding accuracy consistently improves using automatedfeedback across all models in all settings investigated. Overall, our iterativeframework improves semantic grounding in VLMs by more than 15 accuracy pointsunder noise-free feedback and up to 5 accuracy points under a simple automatedbinary verification mechanism.

It involves splitting acharacter sequence into subwords which are assigned arbitrary indices beforebeing served to the LM. While typically lossless, however, this process maylead to less sample efficient LM training: as it removes character-levelinformation, it could make it harder for LMs to generalise across similarsubwords, such as now and Now. We refer to such subwords as near duplicates. Inthis paper, we study the impact of near duplicate subwords on LM trainingefficiency. First, we design an experiment that gives us an upper bound to howmuch we should expect a model to improve if we could perfectly generaliseacross near duplicates. We do this by duplicating each subword in our LM'svocabulary, creating perfectly equivalent classes of subwords. Experimentally,we find that LMs need roughly 17% more data when trained in a fully duplicatedsetting. Second, we investigate the impact of naturally occurring nearduplicates on LMs. Here, we see that merging them considerably hurts LMperformance. Therefore, although subword duplication negatively impacts LMtraining efficiency, naturally occurring near duplicates may not be as similaras anticipated, limiting the potential for performance improvements.</description><author>Anton Sch√§fer, Thomas Hofmann, Imanol Schlag, Tiago Pimentel</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 18:57:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06508v1</guid></item><item><title>Reconstructing Hand-Held Objects in 3D</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06507v1</link><description>Objects manipulated by the hand (i.e., manipulanda) are particularlychallenging to reconstruct from in-the-wild RGB images or videos. Not only doesthe hand occlude much of the object, but also the object is often only visiblein a small number of image pixels. At the same time, two strong anchors emergein this setting: (1) estimated 3D hands help disambiguate the location andscale of the object, and (2) the set of manipulanda is small relative to allpossible objects. With these insights in mind, we present a scalable paradigmfor handheld object reconstruction that builds on recent breakthroughs in largelanguage/vision models and 3D object datasets. Our model, MCC-Hand-Object(MCC-HO), jointly reconstructs hand and object geometry given a single RGBimage and inferred 3D hand as inputs. Subsequently, we use GPT-4(V) to retrievea 3D object model that matches the object in the image and rigidly align themodel to the network-inferred geometry; we call this alignmentRetrieval-Augmented Reconstruction (RAR). Experiments demonstrate that MCC-HOachieves state-of-the-art performance on lab and Internet datasets, and we showhow RAR can be used to automatically obtain 3D labels for in-the-wild images ofhand-object interactions.</description><author>Jane Wu, Georgios Pavlakos, Georgia Gkioxari, Jitendra Malik</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 18:55:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06507v1</guid></item><item><title>Zero-shot Referring Expression Comprehension via Structural Similarity Between Images and Captions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17048v3</link><description>Zero-shot referring expression comprehension aims at localizing boundingboxes in an image corresponding to provided textual prompts, which requires:(i) a fine-grained disentanglement of complex visual scene and textual context,and (ii) a capacity to understand relationships among disentangled entities.Unfortunately, existing large vision-language alignment (VLA) models, e.g.,CLIP, struggle with both aspects so cannot be directly used for this task. Tomitigate this gap, we leverage large foundation models to disentangle bothimages and texts into triplets in the format of (subject, predicate, object).After that, grounding is accomplished by calculating the structural similaritymatrix between visual and textual triplets with a VLA model, and subsequentlypropagate it to an instance-level similarity matrix. Furthermore, to equip VLAmodels with the ability of relationship understanding, we design atriplet-matching objective to fine-tune the VLA models on a collection ofcurated dataset containing abundant entity relationships. Experimentsdemonstrate that our visual grounding performance increase of up to 19.5% overthe SOTA zero-shot model on RefCOCO/+/g. On the more challenging Who's Waldodataset, our zero-shot approach achieves comparable accuracy to the fullysupervised model.

Aclinical note is not simply a summary of the conversation but requires the useof appropriate medical terminology. The relevant information can then beextracted and organized according to the structure of the SOAP note. In thispaper we analyze two different approaches to generate the different sections ofa SOAP note based on the audio recording of the conversation, and specificallyexamine them in terms of note consistency. The first approach generates thesections independently, while the second method generates them all together. Inthis work we make use of PEGASUS-X Transformer models and observe that bothmethods lead to similar ROUGE values (less than 1% difference) and have nodifference in terms of the Factuality metric. We perform a human evaluation tomeasure aspects of consistency and demonstrate that LLMs like Llama2 can beused to perform the same tasks with roughly the same agreement as the humanannotators. Between the Llama2 analysis and the human reviewers we observe aCohen Kappa inter-rater reliability of 0.79, 1.00, and 0.32 for consistency ofage, gender, and body part injury, respectively. With this we demonstrate theusefulness of leveraging an LLM to measure quality indicators that can beidentified by humans but are not currently captured by automatic metrics. Thisallows scaling evaluation to larger data sets, and we find that clinical noteconsistency improves by generating each new section conditioned on the outputof all previously generated sections.</description><author>Nathan Brake, Thomas Schaaf</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 18:54:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06503v1</guid></item><item><title>Multi-person 3D pose estimation from unlabelled data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08731v3</link><description>Its numerous applications make multi-human 3D pose estimation a remarkablyimpactful area of research. Nevertheless, assuming a multiple-view systemcomposed of several regular RGB cameras, 3D multi-pose estimation presentsseveral challenges. First of all, each person must be uniquely identified inthe different views to separate the 2D information provided by the cameras.Secondly, the 3D pose estimation process from the multi-view 2D information ofeach person must be robust against noise and potential occlusions in thescenario. In this work, we address these two challenges with the help of deeplearning. Specifically, we present a model based on Graph Neural Networkscapable of predicting the cross-view correspondence of the people in thescenario along with a Multilayer Perceptron that takes the 2D points to yieldthe 3D poses of each person. These two models are trained in a self-supervisedmanner, thus avoiding the need for large datasets with 3D annotations.</description><author>Daniel Rodriguez-Criado, Pilar Bachiller, George Vogiatzis, Luis J.

Recent work has argued that permutationsymmetries are the only sources of non-convexity, meaning there are essentiallyno such barriers between trained networks if they are permuted appropriately.In this work, we refine these arguments into three distinct claims ofincreasing strength. We show that existing evidence only supports "weak linearconnectivity"-that for each pair of networks belonging to a set of SGDsolutions, there exist (multiple) permutations that linearly connect it withthe other networks. In contrast, the claim "strong linear connectivity"-thatfor each network, there exists one permutation that simultaneously connects itwith the other networks-is both intuitively and practically more desirable.This stronger claim would imply that the loss landscape is convex afteraccounting for permutation, and enable linear interpolation between three ormore independently trained models without increased loss. In this work, weintroduce an intermediate claim-that for certain sequences of networks, thereexists one permutation that simultaneously aligns matching pairs of networksfrom these sequences. Specifically, we discover that a single permutationaligns sequences of iteratively trained as well as iteratively pruned networks,meaning that two networks exhibit low loss barriers at each step of theiroptimization and sparsification trajectories respectively. Finally, we providethe first evidence that strong linear connectivity may be possible undercertain conditions, by showing that barriers decrease with increasing networkwidth when interpolating among three networks.</description><author>Ekansh Sharma, Devin Kwok, Tom Denton, Daniel M.

Our approach relies on a new ultrafast imaging setup to capture afirst-of-its kind, multi-viewpoint video dataset with picosecond-level temporalresolution. Combined with this dataset, we introduce an efficient neural volumerendering framework based on the transient field. This field is defined as amapping from a 3D point and 2D direction to a high-dimensional, discrete-timesignal that represents time-varying radiance at ultrafast timescales. Renderingwith transient fields naturally accounts for effects due to the finite speed oflight, including viewpoint-dependent appearance changes caused by lightpropagation delays to the camera. We render a range of complex effects,including scattering, specular reflection, refraction, and diffraction.Additionally, we demonstrate removing viewpoint-dependent propagation delaysusing a time warping procedure, rendering of relativistic effects, and videosynthesis of direct and global components of light transport.</description><author>Anagh Malik, Noah Juravsky, Ryan Po, Gordon Wetzstein, Kiriakos N.

Online Direct Policy Optimization: A Comparative Study and A Unified Training Paradigm for Neural Network-Based Optimal Feedback Control</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15930v3</link><description>This work is concerned with solving neural network-based feedback controllersefficiently for optimal control problems. We first conduct a comparative studyof two prevalent approaches: offline supervised learning and online directpolicy optimization. Albeit the training part of the supervised learningapproach is relatively easy, the success of the method heavily depends on theoptimal control dataset generated by open-loop optimal control solvers. Incontrast, direct policy optimization turns the optimal control problem into anoptimization problem directly without any requirement of pre-computing, but thedynamics-related objective can be hard to optimize when the problem iscomplicated. Our results underscore the superiority of offline supervisedlearning in terms of both optimality and training time. To overcome the mainchallenges, dataset and optimization, in the two approaches respectively, wecomplement them and propose the Pre-train and Fine-tune strategy as a unifiedtraining paradigm for optimal feedback control, which further improves theperformance and robustness significantly.

Combinatorial optimization problems, which arise whenconsidering an objective function related to a process of interest on discretestructures, are often challenging due to the rapid growth of the solutionspace. The trial-and-error paradigm of Reinforcement Learning has recentlyemerged as a promising alternative to traditional methods, such as exactalgorithms and (meta)heuristics, for discovering better decision-makingstrategies in a variety of disciplines including chemistry, computer science,and statistics. Despite the fact that they arose in markedly different fields,these techniques share significant commonalities. Therefore, we set out tosynthesize this work in a unifying perspective that we term Graph ReinforcementLearning, interpreting it as a constructive decision-making method for graphproblems. After covering the relevant technical background, we review worksalong the dividing line of whether the goal is to optimize graph structuregiven a process of interest, or to optimize the outcome of the process itselfunder fixed graph structure. Finally, we discuss the common challenges facingthe field and open research questions. In contrast with other surveys, thepresent work focuses on non-canonical graph problems for which performantalgorithms are typically not known and Reinforcement Learning is able toprovide efficient and effective solutions.</description><author>Victor-Alexandru Darvariu, Stephen Hailes, Mirco Musolesi</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 18:45:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06492v1</guid></item><item><title>Influencer Backdoor Attack on Semantic Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12054v4</link><description>When a small number of poisoned samples are injected into the trainingdataset of a deep neural network, the network can be induced to exhibitmalicious behavior during inferences, which poses potential threats toreal-world applications. While they have been intensively studied inclassification, backdoor attacks on semantic segmentation have been largelyoverlooked. Unlike classification, semantic segmentation aims to classify everypixel within a given image. In this work, we explore backdoor attacks onsegmentation models to misclassify all pixels of a victim class by injecting aspecific trigger on non-victim pixels during inferences, which is dubbedInfluencer Backdoor Attack (IBA). IBA is expected to maintain theclassification accuracy of non-victim pixels and mislead classifications of allvictim pixels in every single inference and could be easily applied toreal-world scenes. Based on the context aggregation ability of segmentationmodels, we proposed a simple, yet effective, Nearest-Neighbor trigger injectionstrategy. We also introduce an innovative Pixel Random Labeling strategy whichmaintains optimal performance even when the trigger is placed far from thevictim pixels. Our extensive experiments reveal that current segmentationmodels do suffer from backdoor attacks, demonstrate IBA real-worldapplicability, and show that our proposed techniques can further increaseattack performance.</description><author>Haoheng Lan, Jindong Gu, Philip Torr, Hengshuang Zhao</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 18:44:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12054v4</guid></item><item><title>Pitfalls of Conversational LLMs on News Debiasing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06488v1</link><description>This paper addresses debiasing in news editing and evaluates theeffectiveness of conversational Large Language Models in this task.

While such funding is generally welcomed by OSS practitioners,how OSS developers perceive the relative benefits and drawbacks of governmentalfunding remains an open question. This paper explores this question through acase study on scikit-learn, a Python library for machine learning, whosefunding model combines research grants, commercial sponsorship, communitydonations, and a 32 million EUR grant from the French government's artificialintelligence strategy. Through 25 interviews with scikit-learn maintainers andfunders, this study makes two key contributions with implications for researchand practice. First, it provides novel insights into the role of apublic-private funding model in a successful, community-led OSS project and howmaintainers evaluate their funding model. Furthermore, it highlights thegovernance mechanisms employed by maintainers to safeguard the community ethosof the project. Second, it offers practical implications for OSS developercommunities, companies, and governments. For OSS communities, the studyillustrates the benefits of a diversified funding model in balancing the meritsand drawbacks of different funding sources. For companies, it serves as areminder that sponsoring developers or directly funding OSS projects cansignificantly support OSS maintainers, who often struggle with limitedresources and towering workloads. For governments, the findings emphasise theimportance of funding the maintenance of existing OSS projects in addition toor exclusively funding new innovations.

Asvarious long-text techniques and model architectures emerge, the precise anddetailed evaluation of models' long-text capabilities has become increasinglyimportant. Existing long-text evaluation benchmarks, such as L-Eval andLongBench, construct long-text test sets based on open-source datasets,focusing mainly on QA and summarization tasks. These datasets include testsamples of varying lengths (from 2k to 32k+) entangled together, making itchallenging to assess model capabilities across different length ranges.Moreover, they do not cover the ultralong settings (100k+ tokens) that thelatest LLMs claim to achieve. In this paper, we introduce Ada-LEval, alength-adaptable benchmark for evaluating the long-context understanding ofLLMs. Ada-LEval includes two challenging subsets, TSort and BestAnswer, whichenable a more reliable evaluation of LLMs' long context capabilities. Thesebenchmarks support intricate manipulation of the length of test cases, and caneasily produce text samples up to 128k tokens. We evaluate 4 state-of-the-artclosed-source API models and 6 open-source models with Ada-LEval.

In particular,this failure mode persists in question-answering tasks about vector graphics --images composed purely of 2D objects and shapes. To address this challenge, wepropose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which performstext-based reasoning about vector graphics. VDLM leverages Scalable VectorGraphics (SVG) for a more precise visual description and first uses anoff-the-shelf raster-to-SVG algorithm for encoding. Since existing languagemodels cannot understand raw SVGs in a zero-shot setting, VDLM then bridges SVGwith pretrained language models through a newly introduced intermediatesymbolic representation, Primal Visual Description (PVD), comprising primitiveattributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) with their correspondingpredicted values. PVD is task-agnostic and represents visual primitives thatare universal across all vector graphics. It can be learned with procedurallygenerated (SVG, PVD) pairs and also enables the direct use of LLMs forgeneralization to complex reasoning tasks. By casting an image to a text-basedrepresentation, we can leverage the power of language models to learn alignmentfrom SVG to visual primitives and generalize to unseen question-answeringtasks. Empirical results show that VDLM achieves stronger zero-shot performancecompared to state-of-the-art LMMs, such as GPT-4V, in various low-levelmultimodal perception and reasoning tasks on vector graphics. We additionallypresent extensive analyses on VDLM's performance, demonstrating that ourframework offers better interpretability due to its disentangled perception andreasoning processes.

By state invariance, we mean robust with respect to changes in thestructural form of the object, such as when an umbrella is folded, or when anitem of clothing is tossed on the floor. Since humans generally have nodifficulty in recognizing objects despite such state changes, we are naturallyfaced with the question of whether it is possible to devise a neuralarchitecture with similar abilities. To that end, we present a novel dataset,ObjectsWithStateChange, that captures state and pose variations in the objectimages recorded from arbitrary viewpoints. We believe that this dataset willfacilitate research in fine-grained object recognition and retrieval of objectsthat are capable of state changes. The goal of such research would be to trainmodels capable of generating object embeddings that remain invariant to statechanges while also staying invariant to transformations induced by changes inviewpoint, pose, illumination, etc. To demonstrate the usefulness of theObjectsWithStateChange dataset, we also propose a curriculum learning strategythat uses the similarity relationships in the learned embedding space aftereach epoch to guide the training process. The model learns discriminativefeatures by comparing visually similar objects within and across differentcategories, encouraging it to differentiate between objects that may bechallenging to distinguish due to changes in their state. We believe that thisstrategy enhances the model's ability to capture discriminative features forfine-grained tasks that may involve objects with state changes, leading toperformance improvements on object-level tasks not only on our new dataset, butalso on two other challenging multi-view datasets such as ModelNet40 andObjectPI.</description><author>Rohan Sarkar, Avinash Kak</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 18:17:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06470v1</guid></item><item><title>Hyperparameter Selection in Continual Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06466v1</link><description>In continual learning (CL) -- where a learner trains on a stream of data --standard hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) cannot be applied, as a learner doesnot have access to all of the data at the same time. This has prompted thedevelopment of CL-specific HPO frameworks. The most popular way to tunehyperparameters in CL is to repeatedly train over the whole data stream withdifferent hyperparameter settings. However, this end-of-training HPO isunrealistic as in practice a learner can only see the stream once. Hence, thereis an open question: what HPO framework should a practitioner use for a CLproblem in reality? This paper answers this question by evaluating severalrealistic HPO frameworks. We find that all the HPO frameworks considered,including end-of-training HPO, perform similarly. We therefore advocate usingthe realistic and most computationally efficient method: fitting thehyperparameters on the first task and then fixing them throughout training.</description><author>Thomas L.

In analogy with GANs, those noisemaps could be considered as the latent code associated with the generatedimage. However, this native noise space does not possess a convenientstructure, and is thus challenging to work with in editing tasks. Here, wepropose an alternative latent noise space for DDPM that enables a wide range ofediting operations via simple means, and present an inversion method forextracting these edit-friendly noise maps for any given image (real orsynthetically generated). As opposed to the native DDPM noise space, theedit-friendly noise maps do not have a standard normal distribution and are notstatistically independent across timesteps. However, they allow perfectreconstruction of any desired image, and simple transformations on themtranslate into meaningful manipulations of the output image (e.g. shifting,color edits). Moreover, in text-conditional models, fixing those noise mapswhile changing the text prompt, modifies semantics while retaining structure.We illustrate how this property enables text-based editing of real images viathe diverse DDPM sampling scheme (in contrast to the popular non-diverse DDIMinversion). We also show how it can be used within existing diffusion-basedediting methods to improve their quality and diversity.

As a remedy, causal sensitivityanalysis is an important tool to draw causal conclusions under unobservedconfounding with mathematical guarantees. In this paper, we propose NeuralCSA,a neural framework for generalized causal sensitivity analysis. Unlike previouswork, our framework is compatible with (i) a large class of sensitivity models,including the marginal sensitivity model, f-sensitivity models, and Rosenbaum'ssensitivity model; (ii) different treatment types (i.e., binary andcontinuous); and (iii) different causal queries, including (conditional)average treatment effects and simultaneous effects on multiple outcomes. Thegenerality of NeuralCSA is achieved by learning a latent distribution shiftthat corresponds to a treatment intervention using two conditional normalizingflows. We provide theoretical guarantees that NeuralCSA is able to infer validbounds on the causal query of interest and also demonstrate this empiricallyusing both simulated and real-world data.</description><author>Dennis Frauen, Fergus Imrie, Alicia Curth, Valentyn Melnychuk, Stefan Feuerriegel, Mihaela van der Schaar</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 18:08:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16026v2</guid></item><item><title>Interpreting Key Mechanisms of Factual Recall in Transformer-Based Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19521v2</link><description>In this paper, we deeply explore the mechanisms employed by Transformer-basedlanguage models in factual recall tasks. In zero-shot scenarios, given a promptlike "The capital of France is," task-specific attention heads extract thetopic entity, such as "France," from the context and pass it to subsequent MLPsto recall the required answer such as "Paris." We introduce a novel analysismethod aimed at decomposing the outputs of the MLP into componentsunderstandable by humans. Through this method, we quantify the function of theMLP layer following these task-specific heads. In the residual stream, iteither erases or amplifies the information originating from individual heads.Moreover, it generates a component that redirects the residual stream towardsthe direction of its expected answer. These zero-shot mechanisms are alsoemployed in few-shot scenarios. Additionally, we observed a widely existentanti-overconfidence mechanism in the final layer of models, which suppressescorrect predictions. We mitigate this suppression by leveraging ourinterpretation to improve factual recall performance.

Forexample, given an image with a girl playing guitar before a building, one mayanalogously imagine how it seems like if Iron Man playing guitar before Pyramidin Egypt. Nonetheless, visual condition may not be precisely aligned with theimaginary result indicated by text prompt, and existing layout-controllabletext-to-image (T2I) generation models is prone to producing degraded generatedresults with obvious artifacts. To address this issue, we present a novel T2Igeneration method dubbed SmartControl, which is designed to modify the roughvisual conditions for adapting to text prompt. The key idea of our SmartControlis to relax the visual condition on the areas that are conflicted with textprompts. In specific, a Control Scale Predictor (CSP) is designed to identifythe conflict regions and predict the local control scales, while a dataset withtext prompts and rough visual conditions is constructed for training CSP. It isworth noting that, even with a limited number (e.g., 1,000~2,000) of trainingsamples, our SmartControl can generalize well to unseen objects. Extensiveexperiments on four typical visual condition types clearly show the efficacy ofour SmartControl against state-of-the-arts.

However,for many downstream tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune LLMs using privatedata. While federated learning offers a promising privacy-preserving solutionto LLM fine-tuning, the substantial size of an LLM, combined with highcomputational and communication demands, makes it hard to apply to downstreamtasks. More importantly, private edge servers often possess varying computingand network resources in real-world scenarios, introducing additionalcomplexities to LLM fine-tuning. To tackle these problems, we design andimplement an automated federated pipeline, named FedPipe, to fine-tune LLMswith minimal training cost but without adding any inference latency. FedPipefirstly identifies the weights to be fine-tuned based on their contributions tothe LLM training. It then configures a low-rank adapter for each selectedweight to train local low-rank adapters on an edge server, and aggregate localadapters of all edge servers to fine-tune the whole LLM. Finally, itappropriately quantizes the parameters of LLM to reduce memory space accordingto the requirements of edge servers. Extensive experiments demonstrate thatFedPipe expedites the model training and achieves higher accuracy thanstate-of-the-art benchmarks.</description><author>Zihan Fang, Zheng Lin, Zhe Chen, Xianhao Chen, Yue Gao, Yuguang Fang</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:50:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06448v1</guid></item><item><title>The Central Spanning Tree Problem</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06447v1</link><description>Spanning trees are an important primitive in many data analysis tasks, when adata set needs to be summarized in terms of its "skeleton", or when atree-shaped graph over all observations is required for downstream processing.Popular definitions of spanning trees include the minimum spanning tree and theoptimum distance spanning tree, a.k.a. the minimum routing cost tree. Whensearching for the shortest spanning tree but admitting additional branchingpoints, even shorter spanning trees can be realized: Steiner trees.Unfortunately, both minimum spanning and Steiner trees are not robust withrespect to noise in the observations; that is, small perturbations of theoriginal data set often lead to drastic changes in the associated spanningtrees. In response, we make two contributions when the data lies in a Euclideanspace: on the theoretical side, we introduce a new optimization problem, the"(branched) central spanning tree", which subsumes all previously mentioneddefinitions as special cases. On the practical side, we show empirically thatthe (branched) central spanning tree is more robust to noise in the data, andas such is better suited to summarize a data set in terms of its skeleton. Wealso propose a heuristic to address the NP-hard optimization problem, andillustrate its use on single cell RNA expression data from biology and 3D pointclouds of plants.</description><author>Enrique Fita Sanmart√≠n, Christoph Schn√∂rr, Fred A.

In this paper, we propose a novel Event Data Association(called EDA) approach to explicitly address the event association and fusionproblem. The proposed EDA seeks for event trajectories that best fit the eventdata, in order to perform unifying data association and information fusion. InEDA, we first asynchronously fuse the event data based on its informationentropy. Then, we introduce a deterministic model hypothesis generationstrategy, which effectively generates model hypotheses from the fused events,to represent the corresponding event trajectories. After that, we present atwo-stage weighting algorithm, which robustly weighs and selects true modelsfrom the generated model hypotheses, through multi-structural geometric modelfitting. Meanwhile, we also propose an adaptive model selection strategy toautomatically determine the number of the true models. Finally, we use theselected true models to associate and fuse the event data, without beingaffected by sensor noise and irrelevant structures. We evaluate the performanceof the proposed EDA on the object tracking task. The experimental results showthe effectiveness of EDA under challenging scenarios, such as high speed,motion blur, and high dynamic range conditions.</description><author>Haosheng Chen, Shuyuan Lin, Yan Yan, Hanzi Wang, Xinbo Gao</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:39:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12962v2</guid></item><item><title>Large Language Models on Fine-grained Emotion Detection Dataset with Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06108v2</link><description>This paper delves into enhancing the classification performance on theGoEmotions dataset, a large, manually annotated dataset for emotion detectionin text.

However, concerns have arisen regarding theunauthorized data usage during the training or fine-tuning process. One exampleis when a model trainer collects a set of images created by a particular artistand attempts to train a model capable of generating similar images withoutobtaining permission and giving credit to the artist. To address this issue, wepropose a method for detecting such unauthorized data usage by planting theinjected memorization into the text-to-image diffusion models trained on theprotected dataset. Specifically, we modify the protected images by addingunique contents on these images using stealthy image warping functions that arenearly imperceptible to humans but can be captured and memorized by diffusionmodels. By analyzing whether the model has memorized the injected content(i.e., whether the generated images are processed by the injectedpost-processing function), we can detect models that had illegally utilized theunauthorized data. Experiments on Stable Diffusion and VQ Diffusion withdifferent model training or fine-tuning methods (i.e, LoRA, DreamBooth, andstandard training) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method indetecting unauthorized data usages.

We introducepfl-research, a fast, modular, and easy-to-use Python framework for simulatingFL. It supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, and non-neural network models, and istightly integrated with state-of-the-art privacy algorithms. We study the speedof open-source FL frameworks and show that pfl-research is 7-72$\times$ fasterthan alternative open-source frameworks on common cross-device setups. Suchspeedup will significantly boost the productivity of the FL research communityand enable testing hypotheses on realistic FL datasets that were previously tooresource intensive. We release a suite of benchmarks that evaluates analgorithm's overall performance on a diverse set of realistic scenarios. Thecode is available on GitHub at https://github.com/apple/pfl-research.</description><author>Filip Granqvist, Congzheng Song, √Åine Cahill, Rogier van Dalen, Martin Pelikan, Yi Sheng Chan, Xiaojun Feng, Natarajan Krishnaswami, Vojta Jina, Mona Chitnis</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 17:23:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06430v1</guid></item><item><title>Towards generalizing deep-audio fake detection networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13033v3</link><description>Today's generative neural networks allow the creation of high-qualitysynthetic speech at scale.

One promising solutioninvolves the fine-tuning of pre-trained 2D diffusion models to harness theircapacity for producing multi-view images, which are then lifted into accurate3D models via methods like fast-NeRFs or large reconstruction models. However,as inconsistency still exists and limited generated resolution, the generationresults of such methods still lack intricate textures and complex geometries.To solve this problem, we propose Magic-Boost, a multi-view conditioneddiffusion model that significantly refines coarse generative results through abrief period of SDS optimization ($\sim15$min). Compared to the previous textor single image based diffusion models, Magic-Boost exhibits a robustcapability to generate images with high consistency from pseudo synthesizedmulti-view images. It provides precise SDS guidance that well aligns with theidentity of the input images, enriching the local detail in both geometry andtexture of the initial generative results. Extensive experiments showMagic-Boost greatly enhances the coarse inputs and generates high-quality 3Dassets with rich geometric and textural details.

Inthis paper, we study the benefits of modeling uncertainty in deep neuralnetworks for survival analysis with a focus on prediction and calibrationperformance. For this, we present a Bayesian deep learning framework thatconsists of three Bayesian network architectures, which we train by optimizingthe Cox partial likelihood and combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertaintywith model-specific epistemic uncertainty.

Without an external intervention, often in terms of ahigh-level command, it is not possible to guarantee that just a low-levelcontrol policy can resolve such deadlocks. Utilizing the generalizability andlow data requirements of large language models (LLMs), this paper explores thepossibility of using LLMs for deadlock resolution. We propose a hierarchicalcontrol framework where an LLM resolves deadlocks by assigning a leader anddirection for the leader to move along. A graph neural network (GNN) basedlow-level distributed control policy executes the assigned plan. Wesystematically study various prompting techniques to improve LLM's performancein resolving deadlocks. In particular, as part of prompt engineering, weprovide in-context examples for LLMs. We conducted extensive experiments onvarious multi-robot environments with up to 15 agents and 40 obstacles.

Rethinking How to Evaluate Language Model Jailbreak</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06407v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly integrated with variousapplications. To ensure that LLMs do not generate unsafe responses, they arealigned with safeguards that specify what content is restricted. However, suchalignment can be bypassed to produce prohibited content using a techniquecommonly referred to as jailbreak. Different systems have been proposed toperform the jailbreak automatically. These systems rely on evaluation methodsto determine whether a jailbreak attempt is successful. However, our analysisreveals that current jailbreak evaluation methods have two limitations. (1)Their objectives lack clarity and do not align with the goal of identifyingunsafe responses. (2) They oversimplify the jailbreak result as a binaryoutcome, successful or not. In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation,informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language modeljailbreak. Additionally, we demonstrate how these metrics correlate with thegoal of different malicious actors. To compute these metrics, we introduce amultifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluationmethod after preprocessing the response. We evaluate our metrics on a benchmarkdataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreaksystems. The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators. We compare ourmultifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods.Experiments demonstrate that our multifaceted evaluation outperforms existingmethods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17% compared to existingbaselines. Our findings motivate the need to move away from the binary view ofthe jailbreak problem and incorporate a more comprehensive evaluation to ensurethe safety of the language model.</description><author>Hongyu Cai, Arjun Arunasalam, Leo Y.

Therefore, automated theoremproving of Olympiad-level geometry problems is considered a notable milestonein human-level automated reasoning. The introduction of AlphaGeometry, aneuro-symbolic model trained with 100 million synthetic samples, marked a majorbreakthrough. It solved 25 of 30 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)problems whereas the reported baseline based on Wu's method solved only ten. Inthis note, we revisit the IMO-AG-30 Challenge introduced with AlphaGeometry,and find that Wu's method is surprisingly strong. Wu's method alone can solve15 problems, and some of them are not solved by any of the other methods. Thisleads to two key findings: (i) Combining Wu's method with the classic syntheticmethods of deductive databases and angle, ratio, and distance chasing solves 21out of 30 methods by just using a CPU-only laptop with a time limit of 5minutes per problem. Essentially, this classic method solves just 4 problemsless than AlphaGeometry and establishes the first fully symbolic baselinestrong enough to rival the performance of an IMO silver medalist. (ii) Wu'smethod even solves 2 of the 5 problems that AlphaGeometry failed to solve.Thus, by combining AlphaGeometry with Wu's method we set a new state-of-the-artfor automated theorem proving on IMO-AG-30, solving 27 out of 30 problems, thefirst AI method which outperforms an IMO gold medalist.</description><author>Shiven Sinha, Ameya Prabhu, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Siddharth Bhat, Matthias Bethge</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 16:54:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06405v1</guid></item><item><title>Apprentices to Research Assistants: Advancing Research with Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06404v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in variousresearch domains.

Unfortunately, these methods are of heuristic nature, they rely ongreedy splits offering no guarantees of global optimality and often leading tounnecessarily complex and hard-to-interpret Decision Trees. Recentbreakthroughs addressed this suboptimality issue in the batch setting, but nosuch work has considered the online setting with data arriving in a stream. Tothis end, we devise a new Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, Thompson SamplingDecision Trees (TSDT), able to produce optimal Decision Trees in an onlinesetting.

This limitation is exacerbated bythe fact that RL often demands a considerable volume of data for effectivelearning. The complexity escalates further when implementing RL in recurrentspiking networks, where inherent noise introduced by spikes adds a layer ofdifficulty. Life-long learning machines must inherently resolve theplasticity-stability paradox. Striking a balance between acquiring newknowledge and maintaining stability is crucial for artificial agents. Toaddress this challenge, we draw inspiration from machine learning technologyand introduce a biologically plausible implementation of proximal policyoptimization, referred to as lf-cs (learning fast changing slow).

This paper summarizes contexts for VSS in two-fold: local temporalcontexts (LTC) which define the contexts from neighboring frames, and globaltemporal contexts (GTC) which represent the contexts from the whole video. Asfor LTC, it includes static and motional contexts, corresponding to static andmoving content in neighboring frames, respectively. Previously, both static andmotional contexts have been studied. However, there is no research aboutsimultaneously learning static and motional contexts (highly complementary).Hence, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Feature Mining (CFFM) technique to learn aunified presentation of LTC. CFFM contains two parts: Coarse-to-Fine FeatureAssembling (CFFA) and Cross-frame Feature Mining (CFM). CFFA abstracts staticand motional contexts, and CFM mines useful information from nearby frames toenhance target features. To further exploit more temporal contexts, we proposeCFFM++ by additionally learning GTC from the whole video. Specifically, weuniformly sample certain frames from the video and extract global contextualprototypes by k-means. The information within those prototypes is mined by CFMto refine target features. Experimental results on popular benchmarksdemonstrate that CFFM and CFFM++ perform favorably against state-of-the-artmethods.

This paperstudies whether the typological similarity between source and target languagesimpacts the performance of cross-lingual transfer, an under-explored topic. Wefirst focus on Basque as the target language, which is an ideal target languagebecause it is typologically different from surrounding languages. Ourexperiments on three Event Extraction tasks show that the shared linguisticcharacteristic between source and target languages does have an impact ontransfer quality. Further analysis of 72 language pairs reveals that for tasksthat involve token classification such as entity and event triggeridentification, common writing script and morphological features produce higherquality cross-lingual transfer. In contrast, for tasks involving structuralprediction like argument extraction, common word order is the most relevantfeature. In addition, we show that when increasing the training size, not allthe languages scale in the same way in the cross-lingual setting. To performthe experiments we introduce EusIE, an event extraction dataset for Basque,which follows the Multilingual Event Extraction dataset (MEE).

This concept ofmode connectivity has played a crucial role in understanding importantphenomena in deep learning. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of this connectivityphenomenon. First, we demonstrate that in the overparameterized case, theconnecting path can be as simple as a two-piece linear path, and the pathlength can be nearly equal to the Euclidean distance. This finding suggeststhat the landscape should be nearly convex in a certain sense. Second, weuncover a surprising star-shaped connectivity: For a finite number of typicalminima, there exists a center on minima manifold that connects all of themsimultaneously via linear paths.

However, current state-of-the-art vision-based roadside detectionmethods possess high accuracy on labeled scenes but have inferior performanceon new scenes. This is because roadside cameras remain stationary afterinstallation and can only collect data from a single scene, resulting in thealgorithm overfitting these roadside backgrounds and camera poses. To addressthis issue, in this paper, we propose an innovative Scenario GeneralizationFramework for Vision-based Roadside 3D Object Detection, dubbed SGV3D.Specifically, we employ a Background-suppressed Module (BSM) to mitigatebackground overfitting in vision-centric pipelines by attenuating backgroundfeatures during the 2D to bird's-eye-view projection. Furthermore, byintroducing the Semi-supervised Data Generation Pipeline (SSDG) using unlabeledimages from new scenes, diverse instance foregrounds with varying camera posesare generated, addressing the risk of overfitting specific camera poses. Weevaluate our method on two large-scale roadside benchmarks. Our methodsurpasses all previous methods by a significant margin in new scenes, including+42.57% for vehicle, +5.87% for pedestrian, and +14.89% for cyclist compared toBEVHeight on the DAIR-V2X-I heterologous benchmark. On the larger-scale Rope3Dheterologous benchmark, we achieve notable gains of 14.48% for car and 12.41%for large vehicle. We aspire to contribute insights on the exploration ofroadside perception techniques, emphasizing their capability for scenariogeneralization.

Presently, the primary alignment methods, RLHFand DPO, require extensive human annotation, which is expensive despite theirefficacy. The significant expenses associated with current alignment techniquesmotivate researchers to investigate the development of annotation-freealignment training methods. In pursuit of improved alignment without relying onexternal annotation, we introduce Latent Distance Guided Alignment Training(LD-Align). This approach seeks to align the model with a high-qualitysupervised fine-tune dataset using guidance from a latent space. The latentspace is generated through sample reconstruction, akin to auto-encoding.Consequently, we utilize the distance between sample pairs in the latent spaceto guide DPO-based alignment training.

We consider here the case wheresuch prediction sets come after a selection process. The selection processrequires that the selected prediction sets be `informative' in a well definedsense. We consider both the classification and regression settings where theanalyst may consider as informative only the sample with prediction sets smallenough, excluding null values, or obeying other appropriate `monotone'constraints. We develop a unified framework for building such informativeconformal prediction sets while controlling the false coverage rate (FCR) onthe selected sample.

However,we dig into current evaluation works and identify two primary issues: 1) Visualcontent is unnecessary for many samples. The answers can be directly inferredfrom the questions and options, or the world knowledge embedded in LLMs. Thisphenomenon is prevalent across current benchmarks. For instance, GeminiProachieves 42.9% on the MMMU benchmark without any visual input, and outperformsthe random choice baseline across six benchmarks over 24% on average. 2)Unintentional data leakage exists in LLM and LVLM training. LLM and LVLM couldstill answer some visual-necessary questions without visual content, indicatingthe memorizing of these samples within large-scale training data. For example,Sphinx-X-MoE gets 43.6% on MMMU without accessing images, surpassing its LLMbackbone with 17.9%. Both problems lead to misjudgments of actual multi-modalgains and potentially misguide the study of LVLM. To this end, we presentMMStar, an elite vision-indispensable multi-modal benchmark comprising 1,500samples meticulously selected by humans. MMStar benchmarks 6 core capabilitiesand 18 detailed axes, aiming to evaluate LVLMs' multi-modal capacities withcarefully balanced and purified samples. These samples are first roughlyselected from current benchmarks with an automated pipeline, human review isthen involved to ensure each curated sample exhibits visual dependency, minimaldata leakage, and requires advanced multi-modal capabilities. Moreover, twometrics are developed to measure data leakage and actual performance gain inmulti-modal training. We evaluate 16 leading LVLMs on MMStar to assess theirmulti-modal capabilities, and on 7 benchmarks with the proposed metrics toinvestigate their data leakage and actual multi-modal gain.</description><author>Lin Chen, Jinsong Li, Xiaoyi Dong, Pan Zhang, Yuhang Zang, Zehui Chen, Haodong Duan, Jiaqi Wang, Yu Qiao, Dahua Lin, Feng Zhao</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 16:17:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20330v2</guid></item><item><title>The Shutdown Problem: An AI Engineering Puzzle for Decision Theorists</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04471v2</link><description>I explain the shutdown problem: the problem of designing artificial agentsthat (1) shut down when a shutdown button is pressed, (2) don't try to preventor cause the pressing of the shutdown button, and (3) otherwise pursue goalscompetently.

We observe the key challenge as the ambiguity of imageand 3D correspondence without explicit geometry to provide occlusioninformation. To address this issue, CN-RMA leverages the synergy of 3Dreconstruction networks and 3D object detection networks, where thereconstruction network provides a rough Truncated Signed Distance Function(TSDF) and guides image features to vote to 3D space correctly in an end-to-endmanner. Specifically, we associate weights to sampled points of each raythrough ray marching, representing the contribution of a pixel in an image tocorresponding 3D locations. Such weights are determined by the predicted signeddistances so that image features vote only to regions near the reconstructedsurface.

SAM, a prompt driven segmentation model, excels in segmentationtasks across diverse domains, while CLIP is renowned for its zero shotrecognition capabilities. However, their unified potential has not yet beenexplored in medical image segmentation. To adapt SAM to medical imaging,existing methods primarily rely on tuning strategies that require extensivedata or prior prompts tailored to the specific task, making it particularlychallenging when only a limited number of data samples are available. This workpresents an in depth exploration of integrating SAM and CLIP into a unifiedframework for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we propose a simpleunified framework, SaLIP, for organ segmentation. Initially, SAM is used forpart based segmentation within the image, followed by CLIP to retrieve the maskcorresponding to the region of interest (ROI) from the pool of SAM generatedmasks. Finally, SAM is prompted by the retrieved ROI to segment a specificorgan. Thus, SaLIP is training and fine tuning free and does not rely on domainexpertise or labeled data for prompt engineering.

We tested their prediction performance on the samedataset (intra-dataset) and across different datasets (cross-dataset). Forintra-dataset predictions, models consistently performed better when fine-tunedwith third-party labels rather than with author labels. For cross-datasetpredictions, most models failed to generalize well to the other datasets,implying that one type of dataset cannot represent all sorts of sarcasm withdifferent styles and domains. Compared to the existing datasets, modelsfine-tuned on the new dataset we release in this work showed the highestgeneralizability to other datasets. With a manual inspection of the datasetsand post-hoc analysis, we attributed the difficulty in generalization to thefact that sarcasm actually comes in different domains and styles. We argue thatfuture sarcasm research should take the broad scope of sarcasm into account.</description><author>Hyewon Jang, Diego Frassinelli</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 15:48:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06357v1</guid></item><item><title>Policy-Guided Diffusion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06356v1</link><description>In many real-world settings, agents must learn from an offline datasetgathered by some prior behavior policy. Such a setting naturally leads todistribution shift between the behavior policy and the target policy beingtrained - requiring policy conservatism to avoid instability and overestimationbias. Autoregressive world models offer a different solution to this bygenerating synthetic, on-policy experience. However, in practice, modelrollouts must be severely truncated to avoid compounding error. As analternative, we propose policy-guided diffusion. Our method uses diffusionmodels to generate entire trajectories under the behavior distribution,applying guidance from the target policy to move synthetic experience furtheron-policy. We show that policy-guided diffusion models a regularized form ofthe target distribution that balances action likelihood under both the targetand behavior policies, leading to plausible trajectories with high targetpolicy probability, while retaining a lower dynamics error than an offlineworld model baseline. Using synthetic experience from policy-guided diffusionas a drop-in substitute for real data, we demonstrate significant improvementsin performance across a range of standard offline reinforcement learningalgorithms and environments. Our approach provides an effective alternative toautoregressive offline world models, opening the door to the controllablegeneration of synthetic training data.</description><author>Matthew Thomas Jackson, Michael Tryfan Matthews, Cong Lu, Benjamin Ellis, Shimon Whiteson, Jakob Foerster</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 15:46:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06356v1</guid></item><item><title>High Noise Scheduling is a Must</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06353v1</link><description>Consistency models possess high capabilities for image generation, advancingsampling steps to a single step through their advanced techniques.

Even though the proposedcurriculum and noise scheduling in improved training techniques yield betterresults than basic consistency models, it lacks well balanced noisedistribution and its consistency between curriculum. In this study, it isinvestigated the balance between high and low noise levels in noisedistribution and offered polynomial noise distribution to maintain thestability.

However, there is limited work on BEVsegmentation for surround-view fisheye cameras, commonly used in commercialvehicles. As this task has no real-world public dataset and existing syntheticdatasets do not handle amodal regions due to occlusion, we create a syntheticdataset using the Cognata simulator comprising diverse road types, weather, andlighting conditions. We generalize the BEV segmentation to work with any cameramodel; this is useful for mixing diverse cameras. We implement a baseline byapplying cylindrical rectification on the fisheye images and using a standardLSS-based BEV segmentation model. We demonstrate that we can achieve betterperformance without undistortion, which has the adverse effects of increasedruntime due to pre-processing, reduced field-of-view, and resampling artifacts.Further, we introduce a distortion-aware learnable BEV pooling strategy that ismore effective for the fisheye cameras. We extend the model with an occlusionreasoning module, which is critical for estimating in BEV space.

The recent mainstream methods follow a static paradigm, whichpredicts the future trajectory by using a fixed duration of historical frames.These methods make the predictions independently even at adjacent time steps,which leads to potential instability and temporal inconsistency. As successivetime steps have largely overlapping historical frames, their forecasting shouldhave intrinsic correlation, such as overlapping predicted trajectories shouldbe consistent, or be different but share the same motion goal depending on theroad situation. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce HPNet, a noveldynamic trajectory forecasting method. Aiming for stable and accuratetrajectory forecasting, our method leverages not only historical framesincluding maps and agent states, but also historical predictions. Specifically,we newly design a Historical Prediction Attention module to automaticallyencode the dynamic relationship between successive predictions. Besides, italso extends the attention range beyond the currently visible windowbenefitting from the use of historical predictions. The proposed HistoricalPrediction Attention together with the Agent Attention and Mode Attention isfurther formulated as the Triple Factorized Attention module, serving as thecore design of HPNet.Experiments on the Argoverse and INTERACTION datasets showthat HPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, and generates accurate andstable future trajectories.

While Machine Learning algorithms and Decision SupportSystems (DSSs) offer effective solutions for this task, simply pinpointinganomalies may prove insufficient in real-world applications. Users requireinsights into the rationale behind these predictions to facilitate root causeanalysis and foster trust in the model. However, the unsupervised nature of ADpresents a challenge in developing interpretable tools. This paper addressesthis challenge by introducing ExIFFI, a novel interpretability approachspecifically designed to explain the predictions made by Extended IsolationForest. ExIFFI leverages feature importance to provide explanations at bothglobal and local levels. This work also introduces EIF+, an enhanced variant ofExtended Isolation Forest, conceived to improve its generalization capabilitiesthrough a different splitting hyperplanes design strategy. A comprehensivecomparative analysis is conducted, employing both synthetic and real-worlddatasets to evaluate various unsupervised AD approaches. The analysisdemonstrates the effectiveness of ExIFFI in providing explanations for ADpredictions. Furthermore, the paper explores the utility of ExIFFI as a featureselection technique in unsupervised settings.

They initially predict the flow from consecutive RS frames,subsequently rescaling it as the displacement fields from the RS frame to theunderlying GS image using time-dependent scaling factors. Following this,RS-aware forward warping is employed to convert the RS image into its GScounterpart. Nevertheless, this strategy is prone to two shortcomings. First,the undistortion flow estimation is rendered inaccurate by merely linearscaling the flow, due to the complex non-linear motion nature. Second, RS-awareforward warping often results in unavoidable artifacts. To address theselimitations, we introduce a new framework that directly estimates thedistortion flow and rectifies the RS image with the backward warping operation.More specifically, we first propose a global correlation-based flow attentionmechanism to estimate the initial distortion flow and GS feature jointly, whichare then refined by the following coarse-to-fine decoder layers. Additionally,a multi-distortion flow prediction strategy is integrated to mitigate the issueof inaccurate flow estimation further. Experimental results validate theeffectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms state-of-the-artapproaches on various benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency.

With theproliferation of LLMs, the evaluation of this capacity is increasinglygarnering attention. However, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark hasrendered existing evaluation studies being straightforward, undiversified, andhomogeneous. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a comprehensivebenchmark, namely CausalBench, to evaluate the causality understandingcapabilities of LLMs. Originating from the causal research community,CausalBench encompasses three causal learning-related tasks, which facilitate aconvenient comparison of LLMs' performance with classic causal learningalgorithms. Meanwhile, causal networks of varying scales and densities areintegrated in CausalBench, to explore the upper limits of LLMs' capabilitiesacross task scenarios of varying difficulty. Notably, background knowledge andstructured data are also incorporated into CausalBench to thoroughly unlock theunderlying potential of LLMs for long-text comprehension and prior informationutilization. Based on CausalBench, this paper evaluates nineteen leading LLMsand unveils insightful conclusions in diverse aspects. Firstly, we present thestrengths and weaknesses of LLMs and quantitatively explore the upper limits oftheir capabilities across various scenarios. Meanwhile, we further discern theadaptability and abilities of LLMs to specific structural networks and complexchain of thought structures. Moreover, this paper quantitatively presents thedifferences across diverse information sources and uncovers the gap betweenLLMs' capabilities in causal understanding within textual contexts andnumerical domains.</description><author>Yu Zhou, Xingyu Wu, Beicheng Huang, Jibin Wu, Liang Feng, Kay Chen Tan</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 15:40:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06349v1</guid></item><item><title>TeenyTinyLlama: open-source tiny language models trained in Brazilian Portuguese</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16640v2</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural languageprocessing, but their progress has yet to be equal across languages.

Under the emerging Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG)paradigm, we envision the need to evaluate next-level language understandingabilities of embedding models, and take a conscious look at the reasoningabilities stored in them. Addressing this, we pose the question: Can retrieverssolve reasoning problems? By transforming reasoning tasks into retrieval tasks,we find that without specifically trained for reasoning-level languageunderstanding, current state-of-the-art retriever models may still be far frombeing competent for playing the role of assisting LLMs, especially inreasoning-intensive tasks. Moreover, albeit trained to be aware ofinstructions, instruction-aware IR models are often better off withoutinstructions in inference time for reasoning tasks, posing an overlookedretriever-LLM behavioral gap for the research community to align. However,recent decoder-based embedding models show great promise in narrowing the gap,highlighting the pathway for embedding models to achieve reasoning-levellanguage understanding. We also show that, although current off-the-shelfre-ranker models fail on these tasks, injecting reasoning abilities into themthrough fine-tuning still appears easier than doing so to bi-encoders, and weare able to achieve state-of-the-art performance across all tasks byfine-tuning a reranking model.

However, current approaches face twocritical limitations: i) they struggle to converge when client domains aresufficiently different, and ii) current aggregation techniques produce anidentical global model for each client. In this work, we address these issuesby reformulating the typical federated learning setup: rather than learning asingle global model, we learn N models each optimized for a common objective.To achieve this, we apply a weighted distance minimization to model parametersshared in a peer-to-peer topology. The resulting framework, Iterative ParameterAlignment, applies naturally to the cross-silo setting, and has the followingproperties: (i) a unique solution for each participant, with the option toglobally converge each model in the federation, and (ii) an optionalearly-stopping mechanism to elicit fairness among peers in collaborativelearning settings. These characteristics jointly provide a flexible newframework for iteratively learning from peer models trained on disparatedatasets. We find that the technique achieves competitive results on a varietyof data partitions compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Further, we showthat the method is robust to divergent domains (i.e. disjoint classes acrosspeers) where existing approaches struggle.</description><author>Matt Gorbett, Hossein Shirazi, Indrakshi Ray</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 15:15:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04818v4</guid></item></channel></rss>

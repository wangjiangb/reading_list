In this work, wereveal that diffusion model objectives are actually closely related to theELBO. Specifically, we show that all commonly used diffusion model objectivesequate to a weighted integral of ELBOs over different noise levels, where theweighting depends on the specific objective used. Under the condition ofmonotonic weighting, the connection is even closer: the diffusion objectivethen equals the ELBO, combined with simple data augmentation, namely Gaussiannoise perturbation. We show that this condition holds for a number ofstate-of-the-art diffusion models. In experiments, we explore new monotonic weightings and demonstrate theireffectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores on the high-resolutionImageNet benchmark.</description><author>Diederik P.

Such systemslack the ability to actively reason and comprehend implicit user intentions. Inthis work, we propose a new segmentation task -- reasoning segmentation. Thetask is designed to output a segmentation mask given a complex and implicitquery text. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark comprising over one thousandimage-instruction pairs, incorporating intricate reasoning and world knowledgefor evaluation purposes. Finally, we present LISA: large Language InstructedSegmentation Assistant, which inherits the language generation capabilities ofthe multi-modal Large Language Model (LLM) while also possessing the ability toproduce segmentation masks. We expand the original vocabulary with a &lt;SEG&gt;token and propose the embedding-as-mask paradigm to unlock the segmentationcapability. Remarkably, LISA can handle cases involving: 1) complex reasoning;2) world knowledge; 3) explanatory answers; 4) multi-turn conversation. Also,it demonstrates robust zero-shot capability when trained exclusively onreasoning-free datasets. In addition, fine-tuning the model with merely 239reasoning segmentation image-instruction pairs results in further performanceenhancement. Experiments show our method not only unlocks new reasoningsegmentation capabilities but also proves effective in both complex reasoningsegmentation and standard referring segmentation tasks.

To date, themost performant VPR approaches are environment- and task-specific: while theyexhibit strong performance in structured environments (predominantly urbandriving), their performance degrades severely in unstructured environments,rendering most approaches brittle to robust real-world deployment. In thiswork, we develop a universal solution to VPR -- a technique that works across abroad range of structured and unstructured environments (urban, outdoors,indoors, aerial, underwater, and subterranean environments) without anyre-training or fine-tuning. We demonstrate that general-purpose featurerepresentations derived from off-the-shelf self-supervised models with noVPR-specific training are the right substrate upon which to build such auniversal VPR solution. Combining these derived features with unsupervisedfeature aggregation enables our suite of methods, AnyLoc, to achieve up to 4Xsignificantly higher performance than existing approaches. We further obtain a6% improvement in performance by characterizing the semantic properties ofthese features, uncovering unique domains which encapsulate datasets fromsimilar environments. Our detailed experiments and analysis lay a foundationfor building VPR solutions that may be deployed anywhere, anytime, and acrossanyview.

By viewing image formation as the sequential accumulation of photonson a detector grid, we show that a network trained to predict where the nextphoton could arrive is in fact solving the minimum mean square error (MMSE)denoising task. This new perspective allows us to make three contributions: Wepresent a new strategy for self-supervised denoising, We present a new methodfor sampling from the posterior of possible solutions by iteratively samplingand adding small numbers of photons to the image. We derive a full generativemodel by starting this process from an empty canvas. We call this approachgenerative accumulation of photons (GAP). We evaluate our method quantitativelyand qualitatively on 4 new fluorescence microscopy datasets, which will be madeavailable to the community. We find that it outperforms supervised,self-supervised and unsupervised baselines or performs on-par.</description><author>Alexander Krull, Hector Basevi, Benjamin Salmon, Andre Zeug, Franziska MÃ¼ller, Samuel Tonks, Leela Muppala, Ales Leonardis</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 18:44:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06607v2</guid></item><item><title>The Current State of Summarization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04853v2</link><description>With the explosive growth of textual information, summarization systems havebecome increasingly important.

In HDC, the data are encoded with long vectors, calledhypervectors, typically with a length of 1K to 10K. The literature providesseveral encoding techniques to generate orthogonal or correlated hypervectors,depending on the intended application. The existing surveys in the literatureoften focus on the overall aspects of HDC systems, including system inputs,primary computations, and final outputs. However, this study takes a morespecific approach. It zeroes in on the HDC system input and the generation ofhypervectors, directly influencing the hypervector encoding process. Thissurvey brings together various methods for hypervector generation fromdifferent studies and explores the limitations, challenges, and potentialbenefits they entail.

We utilize rewardmachines to incorporate high-level knowledge of complex tasks. We develop analgorithm called Q-learning with reward machines for stochastic games (QRM-SG),to learn the best-response strategy at Nash equilibrium for each agent. InQRM-SG, we define the Q-function at a Nash equilibrium in augmented statespace. The augmented state space integrates the state of the stochastic gameand the state of reward machines. Each agent learns the Q-functions of allagents in the system. We prove that Q-functions learned in QRM-SG converge tothe Q-functions at a Nash equilibrium if the stage game at each time stepduring learning has a global optimum point or a saddle point, and the agentsupdate Q-functions based on the best-response strategy at this point. We usethe Lemke-Howson method to derive the best-response strategy given currentQ-functions. The three case studies show that QRM-SG can learn thebest-response strategies effectively. QRM-SG learns the best-responsestrategies after around 7500 episodes in Case Study I, 1000 episodes in CaseStudy II, and 1500 episodes in Case Study III, while baseline methods such asNash Q-learning and MADDPG fail to converge to the Nash equilibrium in allthree case studies.</description><author>Jueming Hu, Jean-Raphael Gaglione, Yanze Wang, Zhe Xu, Ufuk Topcu, Yongming Liu</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 18:33:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17372v2</guid></item><item><title>Applicability of scaling laws to vision encoding models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00678v1</link><description>In this paper, we investigated how to build a high-performance visionencoding model to predict brain activity as part of our participation in theAlgonauts Project 2023 Challenge. The challenge provided brain activityrecorded by functional MRI (fMRI) while participants viewed images. Severalvision models with parameter sizes ranging from 86M to 4.3B were used to buildpredictive models. To build highly accurate models, we focused our analysis ontwo main aspects: (1) How does the sample size of the fMRI training set changethe prediction accuracy? (2) How does the prediction accuracy across the visualcortex vary with the parameter size of the vision models? The results show thatas the sample size used during training increases, the prediction accuracyimproves according to the scaling law. Similarly, we found that as theparameter size of the vision models increases, the prediction accuracy improvesaccording to the scaling law. These results suggest that increasing the samplesize of the fMRI training set and the parameter size of visual models maycontribute to more accurate visual models of the brain and lead to a betterunderstanding of visual neuroscience.</description><author>Takuya Matsuyama, Kota S Sasaki, Shinji Nishimoto</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 18:31:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00678v1</guid></item><item><title>The Intel Neuromorphic DNS Challenge</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09503v3</link><description>A critical enabler for progress in neuromorphic computing research is theability to transparently evaluate different neuromorphic solutions on importanttasks and to compare them to state-of-the-art conventional solutions. The IntelNeuromorphic Deep Noise Suppression Challenge (Intel N-DNS Challenge), inspiredby the Microsoft DNS Challenge, tackles a ubiquitous and commercially relevanttask: real-time audio denoising. Audio denoising is likely to reap the benefitsof neuromorphic computing due to its low-bandwidth, temporal nature and itsrelevance for low-power devices. The Intel N-DNS Challenge consists of twotracks: a simulation-based algorithmic track to encourage algorithmicinnovation, and a neuromorphic hardware (Loihi 2) track to rigorously evaluatesolutions. For both tracks, we specify an evaluation methodology based onenergy, latency, and resource consumption in addition to output audio quality.We make the Intel N-DNS Challenge dataset scripts and evaluation code freelyaccessible, encourage community participation with monetary prizes, and releasea neuromorphic baseline solution which shows promising audio quality, highpower efficiency, and low resource consumption when compared to MicrosoftNsNet2 and a proprietary Intel denoising model used in production. We hope theIntel N-DNS Challenge will hasten innovation in neuromorphic algorithmsresearch, especially in the area of training tools and methods for real-timesignal processing. We expect the winners of the challenge will demonstrate thatfor problems like audio denoising, significant gains in power and resources canbe realized on neuromorphic devices available today compared to conventionalstate-of-the-art solutions.</description><author>Jonathan Timcheck, Sumit Bam Shrestha, Daniel Ben Dayan Rubin, Adam Kupryjanow, Garrick Orchard, Lukasz Pindor, Timothy Shea, Mike Davies</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 18:27:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09503v3</guid></item><item><title>Tool Documentation Enables Zero-Shot Tool-Usage with Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00675v1</link><description>Today, large language models (LLMs) are taught to use new tools by providinga few demonstrations of the tool's usage. Unfortunately, demonstrations arehard to acquire, and can result in undesirable biased usage if the wrongdemonstration is chosen. Even in the rare scenario that demonstrations arereadily available, there is no principled selection protocol to determine howmany and which ones to provide. As tasks grow more complex, the selectionsearch grows combinatorially and invariably becomes intractable. Our workprovides an alternative to demonstrations: tool documentation. We advocate theuse of tool documentation, descriptions for the individual tool usage, overdemonstrations. We substantiate our claim through three main empirical findingson 6 tasks across both vision and language modalities. First, on existingbenchmarks, zero-shot prompts with only tool documentation are sufficient foreliciting proper tool usage, achieving performance on par with few-shotprompts. Second, on a newly collected realistic tool-use dataset with hundredsof available tool APIs, we show that tool documentation is significantly morevaluable than demonstrations, with zero-shot documentation significantlyoutperforming few-shot without documentation. Third, we highlight the benefitsof tool documentations by tackling image generation and video tracking usingjust-released unseen state-of-the-art models as tools. Finally, we highlightthe possibility of using tool documentation to automatically enable newapplications: by using nothing more than the documentation of GroundingDino,Stable Diffusion, XMem, and SAM, LLMs can re-invent the functionalities of thejust-released Grounded-SAM and Track Anything models.</description><author>Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Si-An Chen, Chun-Liang Li, Yasuhisa Fujii, Alexander Ratner, Chen-Yu Lee, Ranjay Krishna, Tomas Pfister</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 18:21:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00675v1</guid></item><item><title>RibSeg v2: A Large-scale Benchmark for Rib Labeling and Anatomical Centerline Extraction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09309v4</link><description>Automatic rib labeling and anatomical centerline extraction are commonprerequisites for various clinical applications. Prior studies either usein-house datasets that are inaccessible to communities, or focus on ribsegmentation that neglects the clinical significance of rib labeling. Toaddress these issues, we extend our prior dataset (RibSeg) on the binary ribsegmentation task to a comprehensive benchmark, named RibSeg v2, with 660 CTscans (15,466 individual ribs in total) and annotations manually inspected byexperts for rib labeling and anatomical centerline extraction. Based on theRibSeg v2, we develop a pipeline including deep learning-based methods for riblabeling, and a skeletonization-based method for centerline extraction. Toimprove computational efficiency, we propose a sparse point cloudrepresentation of CT scans and compare it with standard dense voxel grids.Moreover, we design and analyze evaluation metrics to address the keychallenges of each task.

However, comparing with frame-based input (e.g., images), event-basedinputs from e.g., Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) can make a better use of SNNsthanks to the SNNs' asynchronous working mechanism. In this paper, westrengthen the marriage between SNNs and event-based inputs with a proposal toconsider anytime optimal inference SNNs, or AOI-SNNs, which can terminateanytime during the inference to achieve optimal inference result. Two noveloptimisation techniques are presented to achieve AOI-SNNs: a regularisation anda cutoff. The regularisation enables the training and construction of SNNs withoptimised performance, and the cutoff technique optimises the inference of SNNson event-driven inputs. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on multiplebenchmark event-based datasets, including CIFAR10-DVS, N-Caltech101 and DVS128Gesture. The experimental results demonstrate that our techniques are superiorto the state-of-the-art with respect to the accuracy and latency.</description><author>Dengyu Wu, Gaojie Jin, Han Yu, Xinping Yi, Xiaowei Huang</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 18:15:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09522v2</guid></item><item><title>Decoupled Diffusion Models with Explicit Transition Probability</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13720v2</link><description>Recent diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have shown remarkable abilitiesof generated content, however, they often suffer from complex forwardprocesses, resulting in inefficient solutions for the reversed process andprolonged sampling times. In this paper, we aim to address the aforementionedchallenges by focusing on the diffusion process itself that we propose todecouple the intricate diffusion process into two comparatively simpler processto improve the generative efficacy and speed. In particular, we present a noveldiffusion paradigm named DDM (Decoupled Diffusion Models) based on the Itodiffusion process, in which the image distribution is approximated by anexplicit transition probability while the noise path is controlled by thestandard Wiener process. We find that decoupling the diffusion process reducesthe learning difficulty and the explicit transition probability improves thegenerative speed significantly. We prove a new training objective for DPM,which enables the model to learn to predict the noise and image componentsseparately. Moreover, given the novel forward diffusion equation, we derive thereverse denoising formula of DDM that naturally supports fewer steps ofgeneration without ordinary differential equation (ODE) based accelerators. Ourexperiments demonstrate that DDM outperforms previous DPMs by a large margin infewer function evaluations setting and gets comparable performances in longfunction evaluations setting. We also show that our framework can be applied toimage-conditioned generation and high-resolution image synthesis, and that itcan generate high-quality images with only 10 function evaluations.</description><author>Yuhang Huang, Zheng Qin, Xinwang Liu, Kai Xu</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 18:12:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13720v2</guid></item><item><title>Learning Generalizable Tool Use with Non-rigid Grasp-pose Registration</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16499v2</link><description>Tool use, a hallmark feature of human intelligence, remains a challengingproblem in robotics due the complex contacts and high-dimensional action space.In this work, we present a novel method to enable reinforcement learning oftool use behaviors.

A core enabler of this change in software development isthe availability of easy-to-use deep learning libraries. Libraries like PyTorchand TensorFlow empower a large variety of intelligent systems, offering amultitude of algorithms and configuration options, applicable to numerousdomains of systems. However, bugs in those popular deep learning libraries alsomay have dire consequences for the quality of systems they enable; thus, it isimportant to understand how bugs are identified and fixed in those libraries. Inspired by a study of Jia et al., which investigates the bug identificationand fixing process at TensorFlow, we characterize bugs in the PyTorch library,a very popular deep learning framework. We investigate the causes and symptomsof bugs identified during PyTorch's development, and assess their localitywithin the project, and extract patterns of bug fixes. Our results highlightthat PyTorch bugs are more like traditional software projects bugs, thanrelated to deep learning characteristics. Finally, we also compare our resultswith the study on TensorFlow, highlighting similarities and differences acrossthe bug identification and fixing process.</description><author>Sharon Chee Yin Ho, Vahid Majdinasab, Mohayeminul Islam, Diego Elias Costa, Emad Shihab, Foutse Khomh, Sarah Nadi, Muhammad Raza</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 17:52:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13777v2</guid></item><item><title>Reasoning or Reciting?

Arethese skills general and transferable, or specialized to specific tasks seenduring pretraining? To disentangle these effects, we propose an evaluationframework based on "counterfactual" task variants that deviate from the defaultassumptions underlying standard tasks. Across a suite of 11 tasks, we observenontrivial performance on the counterfactual variants, but nevertheless findthat performance substantially and consistently degrades compared to thedefault conditions. This suggests that while current LMs may possess abstracttask-solving skills to a degree, they often also rely on narrow,non-transferable procedures for task-solving.

Existing efforts to address this limitationinvolve training specialized architectures, and cannot be easily applied tooff-the-shelf LLMs. We present Parallel Context Windows (PCW), a method thatalleviates the context window restriction for any off-the-shelf LLM withoutfurther training. The key to the approach is to carve a long context intochunks (``windows''), restrict the attention mechanism to apply only withineach window, and re-use the positional embeddings across the windows. Our mainresults test the PCW approach on in-context learning with models that range insize between 750 million and 178 billion parameters, and show substantialimprovements for tasks with diverse input and output spaces. We show additionalbenefits in other settings where long context windows may be beneficial:multi-hop questions and retrieval-augmented question answering with multipleretrieved documents.

Recently,zero-shot OCR has piqued the interest of the research community because itconsiders a practical OCR scenario with unbalanced data distribution. However,there is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating such zero-shot methods that applya divide-and-conquer recognition strategy by decomposing characters intoradicals. Meanwhile, radical recognition, as another important OCR task, alsolacks radical-level annotation for model training. In this paper, we constructan ancient Chinese character image dataset that contains both radical-level andcharacter-level annotations to satisfy the requirements of the above-mentionedmethods, namely, ACCID, where radical-level annotations include radicalcategories, radical locations, and structural relations. To increase theadaptability of ACCID, we propose a splicing-based synthetic characteralgorithm to augment the training samples and apply an image denoising methodto improve the image quality. By introducing character decomposition andrecombination, we propose a baseline method for zero-shot OCR. The experimentalresults demonstrate the validity of ACCID and the baseline model quantitativelyand qualitatively.</description><author>Xiaolei Diao, Daqian Shi, Jian Li, Lida Shi, Mingzhe Yue, Ruihua Qi, Chuntao Li, Hao Xu</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 17:41:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00655v1</guid></item><item><title>Data-driven low-dimensional dynamic model of Kolmogorov flow</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16708v2</link><description>Reduced order models (ROMs) that capture flow dynamics are of interest fordecreasing computational costs for simulation as well as for model-basedcontrol approaches. This work presents a data-driven framework forminimal-dimensional models that effectively capture the dynamics and propertiesof the flow. We apply this to Kolmogorov flow in a regime consisting of chaoticand intermittent behavior, which is common in many flows processes and ischallenging to model. The trajectory of the flow travels near relative periodicorbits (RPOs), interspersed with sporadic bursting events corresponding toexcursions between the regions containing the RPOs. The first step indevelopment of the models is use of an undercomplete autoencoder to map fromthe full state data down to a latent space of dramatically lower dimension.Then models of the discrete-time evolution of the dynamics in the latent spaceare developed. By analyzing the model performance as a function of latent spacedimension we can estimate the minimum number of dimensions required to capturethe system dynamics. To further reduce the dimension of the dynamical model, wefactor out a phase variable in the direction of translational invariance forthe flow, leading to separate evolution equations for the pattern and phase. Ata model dimension of five for the pattern dynamics, as opposed to the fullstate dimension of 1024 (i.e. a 32x32 grid), accurate predictions are found forindividual trajectories out to about two Lyapunov times, as well as forlong-time statistics. Further small improvements in the results occur at adimension of nine. The nearly heteroclinic connections between the differentRPOs, including the quiescent and bursting time scales, are well captured. Wealso capture key features of the phase dynamics. Finally, we use thelow-dimensional representation to predict future bursting events, finding goodsuccess.</description><author>Carlos E. PÃ©rez De JesÃºs, Michael D.

Existing horizontal FL methods generally assume thatthe FL server and clients hold the same model structure. However, due to systemheterogeneity and the need for personalization, enabling clients to hold modelswith diverse structures has become an important direction. Existingmodel-heterogeneous FL approaches often require publicly available datasets andincur high communication and/or computational costs, which limit theirperformances. To address these limitations, we propose a simple but effectiveFederated Global prediction Header (FedGH) approach. It is a communication andcomputation-efficient model-heterogeneous FL framework which trains a sharedgeneralized global prediction header with representations extracted byheterogeneous extractors for clients' models at the FL server. The trainedgeneralized global prediction header learns from different clients. Theacquired global knowledge is then transferred to clients to substitute eachclient's local prediction header. We derive the non-convex convergence rate ofFedGH. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that FedGHachieves significantly more advantageous performance in both model-homogeneousand -heterogeneous FL scenarios compared to seven state-of-the-art personalizedFL models, beating the best-performing baseline by up to 8.87% (formodel-homogeneous FL) and 1.83% (for model-heterogeneous FL) in terms ofaverage test accuracy, while saving up to 85.53% of communication overhead.</description><author>Liping Yi, Gang Wang, Xiaoguang Liu, Zhuan Shi, Han Yu</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 17:30:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13137v2</guid></item><item><title>Seeing Behind Dynamic Occlusions with Event Cameras</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15829v2</link><description>Unwanted camera occlusions, such as debris, dust, rain-drops, and snow, canseverely degrade the performance of computer-vision systems. Dynamic occlusionsare particularly challenging because of the continuously changing pattern.Existing occlusion-removal methods currently use synthetic aperture imaging orimage inpainting. However, they face issues with dynamic occlusions as theserequire multiple viewpoints or user-generated masks to hallucinate thebackground intensity. We propose a novel approach to reconstruct the backgroundfrom a single viewpoint in the presence of dynamic occlusions. Our solutionrelies for the first time on the combination of a traditional camera with anevent camera. When an occlusion moves across a background image, it causesintensity changes that trigger events. These events provide additionalinformation on the relative intensity changes between foreground and backgroundat a high temporal resolution, enabling a truer reconstruction of thebackground content. We present the first large-scale dataset consisting ofsynchronized images and event sequences to evaluate our approach. We show thatour method outperforms image inpainting methods by 3dB in terms of PSNR on ourdataset.</description><author>Rong Zou, Manasi Muglikar, Nico Messikommer, Davide Scaramuzza</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 17:18:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15829v2</guid></item><item><title>Spectral learning of multivariate extremes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07799v3</link><description>We propose a spectral clustering algorithm for analyzing the dependencestructure of multivariate extremes.

However, despite the success ofLLMs, there has been little understanding of how ICL learns the knowledge fromthe given prompts. In this paper, to make progress toward understanding thelearning behaviour of ICL, we train the same LLMs with the same demonstrationexamples via ICL and supervised learning (SL), respectively, and investigatetheir performance under label perturbations (i.e., noisy labels and labelimbalance) on a range of classification tasks. First, via extensiveexperiments, we find that gold labels have significant impacts on thedownstream in-context performance, especially for large language models;however, imbalanced labels matter little to ICL across all model sizes. Second,when comparing with SL, we show empirically that ICL is less sensitive to labelperturbations than SL, and ICL gradually attains comparable performance to SLas the model size increases.</description><author>Xindi Wang, Yufei Wang, Can Xu, Xiubo Geng, Bowen Zhang, Chongyang Tao, Frank Rudzicz, Robert E.

However, prevalent 3D human pose datasets pertaining tooutdoor scenes lack diversity, as they predominantly utilize only one type ofmodality (RGB image or pointcloud), and often feature only one individualwithin each scene. This limited scope of dataset infrastructure considerablyhinders the variability of available data. In this article, we proposeHuman-M3, an outdoor multi-modal multi-view multi-person human pose databasewhich includes not only multi-view RGB videos of outdoor scenes but alsocorresponding pointclouds. In order to obtain accurate human poses, we proposean algorithm based on multi-modal data input to generate ground truthannotation. This benefits from robust pointcloud detection and tracking, whichsolves the problem of inaccurate human localization and matching ambiguity thatmay exist in previous multi-view RGB videos in outdoor multi-person scenes, andgenerates reliable ground truth annotations. Evaluation of multiple differentmodalities algorithms has shown that this database is challenging and suitablefor future research. Furthermore, we propose a 3D human pose estimationalgorithm based on multi-modal data input, which demonstrates the advantages ofmulti-modal data input for 3D human pose estimation.

However, when training machinelearning models for image classification, the relative similarities amongstobject classes are commonly paired with one-hot-encoded labels. According tothis logic, if an image is labelled as 'spoon', then 'tea-spoon' and 'shark'are equally wrong in terms of training loss. To overcome this limitation, weexplore the integration of additional goals that reflect ontological andsemantic knowledge, improving model interpretability and trustworthiness. Wesuggest a generic approach that allows to derive an additional loss termstarting from any kind of semantic information about the classification label.First, we show how to apply our approach to ontologies and word embeddings, anddiscuss how the resulting information can drive a supervised learning process.Second, we use our semantically enriched loss to train image classifiers, andanalyse the trade-offs between accuracy, mistake severity, and learned internalrepresentations. Finally, we discuss how this approach can be further exploitedin terms of explainability and adversarial robustness.

Previous studies haveindicated that the amplitude spectrum is susceptible to the disturbance causedby distribution shifts. On the other hand, the phase spectrum preserveshighly-structured spatial information, which is crucial for robust visualrepresentation learning. However, the spatial relationships of phase spectrumremain unexplored in previous researches. In this paper, we aim to clarify therelationships between Domain Generalization (DG) and the frequency components,and explore the spatial relationships of the phase spectrum. Specifically, wefirst introduce a Fourier-based structural causal model which interprets thephase spectrum as semi-causal factors and the amplitude spectrum as non-causalfactors. Then, we propose Phase Matching (PhaMa) to address DG problems. Ourmethod introduces perturbations on the amplitude spectrum and establishesspatial relationships to match the phase components.

Although current vision--language models (VLMs) equipped withVideo Transformers have enabled temporal modeling and yielded superior results,they are at the cost of huge computational power and thus too expensive todeploy in real-time application scenarios. An economical workaround onlysamples a small portion of frames to represent the main content of that videoand tune an image--text model on these sampled frames. Recent videounderstanding models usually randomly sample a set of frames or clips,regardless of internal correlations between their visual contents, nor theirrelevance to the problem. We argue that such kinds of aimless sampling may omitthe key frames from which the correct answer can be deduced, and the situationgets worse when the sampling sparsity increases, which always happens as thevideo lengths increase. To mitigate this issue, we propose two frame samplingstrategies, namely the most domain frames (MDF) and most implied frames (MIF),to maximally preserve those frames that are most likely vital to the givenquestions. MDF passively minimizes the risk of key frame omission in abootstrap manner, while MIS actively searches key frames customized for eachvideo--question pair with the assistance of auxiliary models.

Related methods such as multi-view clustering mainly projectmulti-modal features into a joint feature space. However, multi-modal cluefeatures are usually rather weakly correlated due to the semantic gap from themodality-specific uniqueness. As a result, these methods are not suitable forperson clustering. In this paper, we propose a Relation-Aware Distributionrepresentation Network (RAD-Net) to generate a distribution representation formulti-modal clues. The distribution representation of a clue is a vectorconsisting of the relation between this clue and all other clues from allmodalities, thus being modality agnostic and good for person clustering.Accordingly, we introduce a graph-based method to construct distributionrepresentation and employ a cyclic update policy to refine distributionrepresentation progressively. Our method achieves substantial improvements of+6% and +8.2% in F-score on the Video Person-Clustering Dataset (VPCD) andVoxCeleb2 multi-view clustering dataset, respectively.

Machine learning techniques haveshown success in automating this process by detecting hidden patterns anddeviations in large-scale data. The potential of quantum computing for machinelearning has been widely recognized, leading to extensive research efforts todevelop suitable quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms. In particular, thesearch for QML algorithms for near-term NISQ devices is in full swing. However,NISQ devices pose additional challenges due to their limited qubit coherencetimes, low number of qubits, and high error rates. Kernel methods based onquantum kernel estimation have emerged as a promising approach to QML on NISQdevices, offering theoretical guarantees, versatility, and compatibility withNISQ constraints. Especially support vector machines (SVM) utilizing quantumkernel estimation have shown success in various supervised learning tasks.However, in the context of AD, semisupervised learning is of great relevance,and yet there is limited research published in this area. This paper introducesan approach to semisupervised AD based on the reconstruction loss of a supportvector regression (SVR) with quantum kernel. This novel model is an alternativeto the variational quantum and quantum kernel one-class classifiers, and iscompared to a quantum autoencoder as quantum baseline and a SVR withradial-basis-function (RBF) kernel as well as a classical autoencoder asclassical baselines. The models are benchmarked extensively on 10 real-world ADdata sets and one toy data set, and it is shown that our SVR model with quantumkernel performs better than the SVR with RBF kernel as well as all othermodels, achieving highest mean AUC over all data sets.

Because depressed patients constantly sharetheir symptoms, major life events, and treatments on social media, researchersare turning to user-generated digital traces on social media for depressiondetection. Such methods have distinct advantages in combating depressionbecause they can facilitate innovative approaches to fight depression andalleviate its social and economic burden. However, most existing studies lackeffective means to incorporate established medical domain knowledge indepression detection or suffer from feature extraction difficulties that impedegreater performance. Following the design science research paradigm, we proposea Deep Knowledge-aware Depression Detection (DKDD) framework to accuratelydetect social media users at risk of depression and explain the criticalfactors that contribute to such detection.

Both names refer to a family ofcomputational models that use high-dimensional distributed representations andrely on the algebraic properties of their key operations to incorporate theadvantages of structured symbolic representations and vector distributedrepresentations. Holographic Reduced Representations is an influential HDC/VSAmodel that is well-known in the machine learning domain and often used to referto the whole family. However, for the sake of consistency, we use HDC/VSA torefer to the field. Part I of this survey covered foundational aspects of thefield, such as the historical context leading to the development of HDC/VSA,key elements of any HDC/VSA model, known HDC/VSA models, and the transformationof input data of various types into high-dimensional vectors suitable forHDC/VSA. This second part surveys existing applications, the role of HDC/VSA incognitive computing and architectures, as well as directions for future work.Most of the applications lie within the Machine Learning/ArtificialIntelligence domain, however, we also cover other applications to provide acomplete picture. The survey is written to be useful for both newcomers andpractitioners.</description><author>Denis Kleyko, Dmitri A.

Though Vision GNN (ViG) adopts graph-levelfeatures for complex images, it has some issues, such as inaccurate neighbornode selection, expensive node information aggregation calculation, andover-smoothing in the deep layers. To address the above problems, we propose aProgressive Vision Graph (PVG) architecture for vision recognition task.Compared with previous works, PVG contains three main components: 1)Progressively Separated Graph Construction (PSGC) to introduce second-ordersimilarity by gradually increasing the channel of the global graph branch anddecreasing the channel of local branch as the layer deepens; 2) Neighbor nodesinformation aggregation and update module by using Max pooling and mathematicalExpectation (MaxE) to aggregate rich neighbor information; 3) Graph errorLinear Unit (GraphLU) to enhance low-value information in a relaxed form toreduce the compression of image detail information for alleviating theover-smoothing. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate thesuperiority of PVG over state-of-the-art methods, e.g., our PVG-S obtains 83.0%Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K that surpasses GNN-based ViG-S by +0.9 with theparameters reduced by 18.5%, while the largest PVG-B obtains 84.2% that has+0.5 improvement than ViG-B.

While novel techniques like machinelearning and deep learning may address these shortcomings through generativeimage inpainting, when applied to sensitive research data this may come at thecost of undesired image manipulation. Undesired manipulation may be caused byphenomena such as neural hallucinations, to which some artificial neuralnetworks are prone. To address this, here we evaluate the state-of-the-artinpainting methods for image restoration in a high-content fluorescencemicroscopy dataset of cultured cells with labelled nuclei. We show thatarchitectures like DeepFill V2 and Edge Connect can faithfully restoremicroscopy images upon fine-tuning with relatively little data. Our resultsdemonstrate that the area of the region to be restored is of higher importancethan shape. Furthermore, to control for the quality of restoration, we proposea novel phenotype-preserving metric design strategy. In this strategy, the sizeand count of the restored biological phenotypes like cell nuclei are quantifiedto penalise undesirable manipulation. We argue that the design principles ofour approach may also generalise to other applications.</description><author>Vaibhav Sharma, Artur Yakimovich</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 15:31:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14436v2</guid></item><item><title>Attention is Not All You Need: Pure Attention Loses Rank Doubly Exponentially with Depth</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03404v2</link><description>Attention-based architectures have become ubiquitous in machine learning, yetour understanding of the reasons for their effectiveness remains limited.

We find that theperformance and behavior of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can vary greatly over time.For example, GPT-4 (March 2023) was reasonable at identifying prime vs.composite numbers (84% accuracy) but GPT-4 (June 2023) was poor on these samequestions (51% accuracy). This is partly explained by a drop in GPT-4's amenityto follow chain-of-thought prompting. Interestingly, GPT-3.5 was much better inJune than in March in this task. GPT-4 became less willing to answer sensitivequestions and opinion survey questions in June than in March.

This paper presents DARE-GP, asolution that creates additive noise to mask users' emotional information whilepreserving the transcription-relevant portions of their speech. DARE-GP doesthis by using a constrained genetic programming approach to learn the spectralfrequency traits that depict target users' emotional content, and thengenerating a universal adversarial audio perturbation that provides thisprivacy protection. Unlike existing works, DARE-GP provides: a) real-timeprotection of previously unheard utterances, b) against previously unseenblack-box SER classifiers, c) while protecting speech transcription, and d)does so in a realistic, acoustic environment. Further, this evasion is robustagainst defenses employed by a knowledgeable adversary.

The amount of operating reserves required tomaintain reliable operation of the electric grid rises due to the variabilityof solar energy. The higher the uncertainty in the generation, the greater theoperating-reserve requirements, which translates to an increased cost ofoperation. In this research work, we propose a unified architecture formulti-time-scale predictions for intra-day solar irradiance forecasting usingrecurrent neural networks (RNN) and long-short-term memory networks (LSTMs).This paper also lays out a framework for extending this modeling approach tointra-hour forecasting horizons thus, making it a multi-time-horizonforecasting approach, capable of predicting intra-hour as well as intra-daysolar irradiance. We develop an end-to-end pipeline to effectuate the proposedarchitecture. The performance of the prediction model is tested and validatedby the methodical implementation. The robustness of the approach isdemonstrated with case studies conducted for geographically scattered sitesacross the United States. The predictions demonstrate that our proposed unifiedarchitecture-based approach is effective for multi-time-scale solar forecastsand achieves a lower root-mean-square prediction error when benchmarked againstthe best-performing methods documented in the literature that use separatemodels for each time-scale during the day. Our proposed method results in a71.5% reduction in the mean RMSE averaged across all the test sites compared tothe ML-based best-performing method reported in the literature.

To deal with the widespread label scarcity issue inreal-world applications, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is leveraged to trainGNNs with limited or even no labels by maximizing the mutual informationbetween nodes in its augmented views generated from the original graph.However, the distribution of graphs remains unconsidered in view generation,resulting in the ignorance of unseen edges in most existing literature, whichis empirically shown to be able to improve GCL's performance in ourexperiments. To this end, we propose to incorporate graph generativeadversarial networks (GANs) to learn the distribution of views for GCL, inorder to i) automatically capture the characteristic of graphs foraugmentations, and ii) jointly train the graph GAN model and the GCL model.Specifically, we present GACN, a novel Generative Adversarial Contrastivelearning Network for graph representation learning.

Vehicle trajectory prediction consists oftwo essential tasks, i.e., longitudinal position prediction and lateralposition prediction. There is a significant correlation between drivingintentions and vehicle motion. In existing work, the three tasks are oftenconducted separately without considering the relationships between thelongitudinal position, lateral position, and driving intention. In this paper,we propose a novel Temporal Multi-Gate Mixture-of-Experts (TMMOE) model forsimultaneously predicting the vehicle trajectory and driving intention. Theproposed model consists of three layers: a shared layer, an expert layer, and afully connected layer. In the model, the shared layer utilizes TemporalConvolutional Networks (TCN) to extract temporal features. Then the expertlayer is built to identify different information according to the three tasks.Moreover, the fully connected layer is used to integrate and export predictionresults. To achieve better performance, uncertainty algorithm is used toconstruct the multi-task loss function.

In this work, we propose atransfer-learning algorithm that combines the new and the historical data, thatis especially beneficial when the new data is scarce. We focus the approach onthe linear regression case, which allows us to conduct a rigorous theoreticalstudy on the benefits of the approach. We show that our approach is robustagainst negative transfer-learning, and we confirm this result empirically withreal and simulated data.</description><author>Luis Pedro Silvestrin, Harry van Zanten, Mark Hoogendoorn, Ger Koole</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 14:20:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05069v2</guid></item><item><title>Beating Backdoor Attack at Its Own Game</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15539v2</link><description>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attack, which does notaffect the network's performance on clean data but would manipulate the networkbehavior once a trigger pattern is added. Existing defense methods have greatlyreduced attack success rate, but their prediction accuracy on clean data stilllags behind a clean model by a large margin. Inspired by the stealthiness andeffectiveness of backdoor attack, we propose a simple but highly effectivedefense framework which injects non-adversarial backdoors targeting poisonedsamples. Following the general steps in backdoor attack, we detect a small setof suspected samples and then apply a poisoning strategy to them. Thenon-adversarial backdoor, once triggered, suppresses the attacker's backdoor onpoisoned data, but has limited influence on clean data. The defense can becarried out during data preprocessing, without any modification to the standardend-to-end training pipeline. We conduct extensive experiments on multiplebenchmarks with different architectures and representative attacks. Resultsdemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense effectivenesswith by far the lowest performance drop on clean data. Considering thesurprising defense ability displayed by our framework, we call for moreattention to utilizing backdoor for backdoor defense.

As the the complexity of Integrated Circuits (ICs) increases,there is an increased demand for accurate routing quality prediction. Accuratecongestion prediction aids in identifying design flaws early on, therebyaccelerating circuit design and conserving resources. Despite the advancementsin current congestion prediction methodologies, an essential aspect that hasbeen largely overlooked is the spatial label-correlation between differentgrids in congestion prediction. The spatial label-correlation is a fundamentalcharacteristic of circuit design, where the congestion status of a grid is notisolated but inherently influenced by the conditions of its neighboring grids.In order to fully exploit the inherent spatial label-correlation betweenneighboring grids, we propose a novel approach, {\ours}, i.e., VAriationalLabel-Correlation Enhancement for Congestion Prediction, which considers thelocal label-correlation in the congestion map, associating the estimatedcongestion value of each grid with a local label-correlation weight influencedby its surrounding grids. {\ours} leverages variational inference techniques toestimate this weight, thereby enhancing the regression model's performance byincorporating spatial dependencies. Experiment results validate the superioreffectiveness of {\ours} on the public available \texttt{ISPD2011} and\texttt{DAC2012} benchmarks using the superblue circuit line.</description><author>Biao Liu, Congyu Qiao, Ning Xu, Xin Geng, Ziran Zhu, Jun Yang</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 14:15:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00529v1</guid></item><item><title>Provable convergence guarantees for black-box variational inference</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03638v2</link><description>While black-box variational inference is widely used, there is no proof thatits stochastic optimization succeeds.

However, while efficient algorithmsare known for convex potentials $V$, the situation is much more difficult inthe non-convex case, where algorithms necessarily suffer from the curse ofdimensionality in the worst case. For optimization, which can be seen as alow-temperature limit of sampling, it is known that smooth functions $V$ allowfaster convergence rates. Specifically, for $m$-times differentiable functionsin $d$ dimensions, the optimal rate for algorithms with $n$ functionevaluations is known to be $O(n^{-m/d})$, where the constant can potentiallydepend on $m, d$ and the function to be optimized. Hence, the curse ofdimensionality can be alleviated for smooth functions at least in terms of theconvergence rate. Recently, it has been shown that similarly fast rates canalso be achieved with polynomial runtime $O(n^{3.5})$, where the exponent $3.5$is independent of $m$ or $d$. Hence, it is natural to ask whether similar ratesfor sampling and log-partition computation are possible, and whether they canbe realized in polynomial time with an exponent independent of $m$ and $d$. Weshow that the optimal rates for sampling and log-partition computation aresometimes equal and sometimes faster than for optimization. We then analyzevarious polynomial-time sampling algorithms, including an extension of a recentpromising optimization approach, and find that they sometimes exhibitinteresting behavior but no near-optimal rates. Our results also give furtherinsights on the relation between sampling, log-partition, and optimizationproblems.</description><author>David HolzmÃ¼ller, Francis Bach</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 14:09:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03237v3</guid></item><item><title>Visual attention information can be traced on cortical response but not on the retina: evidence from electrophysiological mouse data using natural images as stimuli</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00526v1</link><description>Visual attention forms the basis of understanding the visual world.

Nevertheless, we find itstill has untapped potential when we re-investigate the temperature, which is acrucial hyper-parameter to soften the logit outputs. For most of the previousworks, it was set as a fixed value for the entire distillation procedure.However, as the logits from different samples are distributed quite variously,it is not feasible to soften all of them to an equal degree by just a singletemperature, which may make the previous work transfer the knowledge of eachsample inadequately. In this paper, we restudy the hyper-parameter temperatureand figure out its incapability to distill the knowledge from each samplesufficiently when it is a single value. To address this issue, we proposeNormalized Knowledge Distillation (NormKD), with the purpose of customizing thetemperature for each sample according to the characteristic of the sample'slogit distribution. Compared to the vanilla KD, NormKD barely has extracomputation or storage cost but performs significantly better on CIRAR-100 andImageNet for image classification. Furthermore, NormKD can be easily applied tothe other logit based methods and achieve better performance which can becloser to or even better than the feature based method.</description><author>Zhihao Chi, Tu Zheng, Hengjia Li, Zheng Yang, Boxi Wu, Binbin Lin, Deng Cai</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 13:59:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00520v1</guid></item><item><title>Markerless human pose estimation for biomedical applications: a survey</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00519v1</link><description>Markerless Human Pose Estimation (HPE) proved its potential to supportdecision making and assessment in many fields of application.

Although many countermeasures have been developed todetect Deepfakes ex-post, undoubtedly, passive forensics has not considered anypreventive measures for the pristine face before foreseeable manipulations. Tocomplete this forensics ecosystem, we thus put forward the proactive solutiondubbed SepMark, which provides a unified framework for source tracing andDeepfake detection. SepMark originates from encoder-decoder-based deepwatermarking but with two separable decoders. For the first time the deepseparable watermarking, SepMark brings a new paradigm to the established studyof deep watermarking, where a single encoder embeds one watermark elegantly,while two decoders can extract the watermark separately at different levels ofrobustness. The robust decoder termed Tracer that resists various distortionsmay have an overly high level of robustness, allowing the watermark to surviveboth before and after Deepfake. The semi-robust one termed Detector isselectively sensitive to malicious distortions, making the watermark disappearafter Deepfake. Only SepMark comprising of Tracer and Detector can reliablytrace the trusted source of the marked face and detect whether it has beenaltered since being marked; neither of the two alone can achieve this.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SepMark ontypical Deepfakes, including face swapping, expression reenactment, andattribute editing.</description><author>Xiaoshuai Wu, Xin Liao, Bo Ou</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 13:57:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06321v2</guid></item><item><title>Noisy Interpolation Learning with Shallow Univariate ReLU Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15396v2</link><description>We study the asymptotic overfitting behavior of interpolation with minimumnorm ($\ell_2$ of the weights) two-layer ReLU networks for noisy univariateregression.

Besides, different from existing models that used CNNs orLSTMs to exploit tumor enhancement patterns on dynamic contrast-enhanced CTimaging, we improved the extraction of dynamic tumor-related texture featuresin multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT by fusing local and global features usingCNN and transformer modules, further enhancing the features extracted acrossmulti-phase CT images.

Nevertheless, most of existing investigations are typicallyhampered by the two flaws. First, self-representation based tensor subspacelearning usually induces high time and space complexity, and is limited inperceiving nonlinear local structure in the embedding space. Second, the tensorsingular value decomposition (t-SVD) model redistributes each singular valueequally without considering the diverse importance among them. To well copewith the issues, we propose a hyper-Laplacian regularized concept factorization(HLRCF) in low-rank tensor space for multi-view clustering. Specifically, weadopt the concept factorization to explore the latent cluster-wiserepresentation of each view. Further, the hypergraph Laplacian regularizationendows the model with the capability of extracting the nonlinear localstructures in the latent space. Considering that different tensor singularvalues associate structural information with unequal importance, we develop aself-weighted tensor Schatten p-norm to constrain the tensor comprised of allcluster-wise representations. Notably, the tensor with smaller size greatlydecreases the time and space complexity in the low-rank optimization. Finally,experimental results on eight benchmark datasets exhibit that HLRCF outperformsother multi-view methods, showingcasing its superior performance.</description><author>Zixiao Yu, Lele Fu, Zhiling Cai, Zhoumin Lu</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 13:43:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11435v2</guid></item><item><title>Explainable Graph Spectral Clustering of Text Documents</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00504v1</link><description>Spectral clustering methods are known for their ability to represent clustersof diverse shapes, densities etc. However, results of such algorithms, whenapplied e.g. to text documents, are hard to explain to the user, especially dueto embedding in the spectral space which has no obvious relation to documentcontents.

We also releasethe inDO, rounDO and OpenDDO datasets of occluded regions used to evaluateOGRIT.</description><author>Cillian Brewitt, Massimiliano Tamborski, Cheng Wang, Stefano V.

Existing RALMapproaches focus on modifying the LM architecture in order to facilitate theincorporation of external information, significantly complicating deployment.This paper considers a simple alternative, which we dub In-Context RALM:leaving the LM architecture unchanged and prepending grounding documents to theinput, without any further training of the LM. We show that In-Context RALMthat builds on off-the-shelf general purpose retrievers provides surprisinglylarge LM gains across model sizes and diverse corpora. We also demonstrate thatthe document retrieval and ranking mechanism can be specialized to the RALMsetting to further boost performance. We conclude that In-Context RALM hasconsiderable potential to increase the prevalence of LM grounding, particularlyin settings where a pretrained LM must be used without modification or even viaAPI access.</description><author>Ori Ram, Yoav Levine, Itay Dalmedigos, Dor Muhlgay, Amnon Shashua, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Yoav Shoham</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 13:10:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00083v3</guid></item><item><title>Retrieval Augmented Generation and Representative Vector Summarization for large unstructured textual data in Medical Education</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00479v1</link><description>Large Language Models are increasingly being used for various tasks includingcontent generation and as chatbots.

This includes ideas as far ranging as exploration bonuses,entropy regularization, and regularization toward teachers or data priors.Often, the task reward and auxiliary objectives are in conflict, and in thispaper we argue that this makes it natural to treat these cases as instances ofmulti-objective (MO) optimization problems. We demonstrate how this perspectiveallows us to develop novel and more effective RL algorithms. In particular, wefocus on offline RL and finetuning as case studies, and show that existingapproaches can be understood as MO algorithms relying on linear scalarization.We hypothesize that replacing linear scalarization with a better algorithm canimprove performance. We introduce Distillation of a Mixture of Experts (DiME),a new MORL algorithm that outperforms linear scalarization and can be appliedto these non-standard MO problems. We demonstrate that for offline RL, DiMEleads to a simple new algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art. Forfinetuning, we derive new algorithms that learn to outperform the teacherpolicy.</description><author>Abbas Abdolmaleki, Sandy H.

Self-supervisedlearning (SSL) can mitigate this problem by training models on unlabeled data.Furthermore, self-supervised pretraining has yielded promising results invisual recognition of natural images but has not been given much considerationin medical image analysis. In this work, we propose a self-supervised method,DINO-CXR, which is a novel adaptation of a self-supervised method, DINO, basedon a vision transformer for chest X-ray classification. A comparative analysisis performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method for bothpneumonia and COVID-19 detection.

This behavior particularly degrades accuracy in groups ofsamples of the correlated class that are missing the spurious feature orsamples of the opposite class but with the spurious feature present. Therecently proposed Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) method improves accuracy ofthese worst groups. Based on the main argument that ERM mods can learn corefeatures sufficiently well, DFR only needs to retrain the last layer of theclassification model with a small group-balanced data set. In this work, weexamine the applicability of DFR to realistic data in the medical domain.Furthermore, we investigate the reasoning behind the effectiveness oflast-layer retraining and show that even though DFR has the potential toimprove the accuracy of the worst group, it remains susceptible to spuriouscorrelations.</description><author>Phuong Quynh Le, JÃ¶rg SchlÃ¶tterer, Christin Seifert</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 12:54:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00473v1</guid></item><item><title>Kernel interpolation generalizes poorly</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15809v2</link><description>One of the most interesting problems in the recent renaissance of the studiesin kernel regression might be whether the kernel interpolation can generalizewell, since it may help us understand the `benign overfitting henomenon'reported in the literature on deep networks. In this paper, under mildconditions, we show that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, the generalization error ofkernel interpolation is lower bounded by $\Omega(n^{-\varepsilon})$. In otherwords, the kernel interpolation generalizes poorly for a large class ofkernels. As a direct corollary, we can show that overfitted wide neuralnetworks defined on the sphere generalize poorly.</description><author>Yicheng Li, Haobo Zhang, Qian Lin</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 12:53:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15809v2</guid></item><item><title>(Local) Differential Privacy has NO Disparate Impact on Fairness</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12845v2</link><description>In recent years, Local Differential Privacy (LDP), a robustprivacy-preserving methodology, has gained widespread adoption in real-worldapplications. With LDP, users can perturb their data on their devices beforesending it out for analysis. However, as the collection of multiple sensitiveinformation becomes more prevalent across various industries, collecting asingle sensitive attribute under LDP may not be sufficient. Correlatedattributes in the data may still lead to inferences about the sensitiveattribute. This paper empirically studies the impact of collecting multiplesensitive attributes under LDP on fairness. We propose a novel privacy budgetallocation scheme that considers the varying domain size of sensitiveattributes. This generally led to a better privacy-utility-fairness trade-offin our experiments than the state-of-art solution. Our results show that LDPleads to slightly improved fairness in learning problems without significantlyaffecting the performance of the models. We conduct extensive experimentsevaluating three benchmark datasets using several group fairness metrics andseven state-of-the-art LDP protocols. Overall, this study challenges the commonbelief that differential privacy necessarily leads to worsened fairness inmachine learning.</description><author>HÃ©ber H.

The two scans are then combinedto get a recombined image showing contrast enhancement. Despite CESM diagnosticadvantages for breast cancer diagnosis, the use of contrast medium can causeside effects, and CESM also beams patients with a higher radiation dosecompared to standard mammography. To address these limitations this workproposes to use deep generative models for virtual contrast enhancement onCESM, aiming to make the CESM contrast-free as well as to reduce the radiationdose. Our deep networks, consisting of an autoencoder and two GenerativeAdversarial Networks, the Pix2Pix, and the CycleGAN, generate syntheticrecombined images solely from low-energy images. We perform an extensivequantitative and qualitative analysis of the model's performance, alsoexploiting radiologists' assessments, on a novel CESM dataset that includes1138 images that, as a further contribution of this work, we make publiclyavailable. The results show that CycleGAN is the most promising deep network togenerate synthetic recombined images, highlighting the potential of artificialintelligence techniques for virtual contrast enhancement in this field.</description><author>Aurora Rofena, Valerio Guarrasi, Marina Sarli, Claudia Lucia Piccolo, Matteo Sammarra, Bruno Beomonte Zobel, Paolo Soda</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 12:49:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00471v1</guid></item><item><title>Mirror Natural Evolution Strategies</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00469v1</link><description>The zeroth-order optimization has been widely used in machine learningapplications. However, the theoretical study of the zeroth-order optimizationfocus on the algorithms which approximate (first-order) gradients using(zeroth-order) function value difference at a random direction. The theory ofalgorithms which approximate the gradient and Hessian information byzeroth-order queries is much less studied. In this paper, we focus on thetheory of zeroth-order optimization which utilizes both the first-order andsecond-order information approximated by the zeroth-order queries. We firstpropose a novel reparameterized objective function with parameters $(\mu,\Sigma)$. This reparameterized objective function achieves its optimum at theminimizer and the Hessian inverse of the original objective functionrespectively, but with small perturbations. Accordingly, we propose a newalgorithm to minimize our proposed reparameterized objective, which we call\texttt{MiNES} (mirror descent natural evolution strategy). We show that theestimated covariance matrix of \texttt{MiNES} converges to the inverse ofHessian matrix of the objective function with a convergence rate$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/k)$, where $k$ is the iteration number and$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ hides the constant and $\log$ terms. We alsoprovide the explicit convergence rate of \texttt{MiNES} and how the covariancematrix promotes the convergence rate.</description><author>Haishan Ye</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 12:45:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00469v1</guid></item><item><title>ChiPFormer: Transferable Chip Placement via Offline Decision Transformer</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14744v2</link><description>Placement is a critical step in modern chip design, aiming to determine thepositions of circuit modules on the chip canvas. Recent works have shown thatreinforcement learning (RL) can improve human performance in chip placement.However, such an RL-based approach suffers from long training time and lowtransfer ability in unseen chip circuits. To resolve these challenges, we castthe chip placement as an offline RL formulation and present ChiPFormer thatenables learning a transferable placement policy from fixed offline data.ChiPFormer has several advantages that prior arts do not have. First,ChiPFormer can exploit offline placement designs to learn transferable policiesmore efficiently in a multi-task setting. Second, ChiPFormer can promoteeffective finetuning for unseen chip circuits, reducing the placement runtimefrom hours to minutes. Third, extensive experiments on 32 chip circuitsdemonstrate that ChiPFormer achieves significantly better placement qualitywhile reducing the runtime by 10x compared to recent state-of-the-artapproaches in both public benchmarks and realistic industrial tasks.

However,sampling effective contrastive pairs remains a challenge due to factors such aslimited batch size, imbalanced data distribution, and the risk of overfitting.In this paper, we propose a novel metric learning function called CenterContrastive Loss, which maintains a class-wise center bank and compares thecategory centers with the query data points using a contrastive loss. Thecenter bank is updated in real-time to boost model convergence without the needfor well-designed sample mining. The category centers are well-optimizedclassification proxies to re-balance the supervisory signal of each class.Furthermore, the proposed loss combines the advantages of both contrastive andclassification methods by reducing intra-class variations and enhancinginter-class differences to improve the discriminative power of embeddings. Ourexperimental results, as shown in Figure 1, demonstrate that a standard network(ResNet50) trained with our loss achieves state-of-the-art performance andfaster convergence.</description><author>Bolun Cai, Pengfei Xiong, Shangxuan Tian</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 12:22:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00458v1</guid></item><item><title>Causal Discovery and Knowledge Injection for Contestable Neural Networks (with Appendices)</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09787v4</link><description>Neural networks have proven to be effective at solving machine learning tasksbut it is unclear whether they learn any relevant causal relationships, whiletheir black-box nature makes it difficult for modellers to understand and debugthem.

Multi-fingered robotic hands, which mimic the structure of the humanhand, can potentially perform complex object manipulations. Nevertheless,current techniques for multi-fingered robotic grasping frequently predict onlya single grasp for each inference time, limiting their versatility andefficiency. This paper proposes a differentiable multi-fingered graspgeneration network (DMFC-GraspNet) with two main contributions to address thischallenge. Firstly, a novel neural grasp planner is proposed, which predicts anew grasp representation to enable versatile and dense grasp predictions.Secondly, a scene creation and label mapping method is developed for denselabeling of multi-fingered robotic hands, which allows a dense association ofground truth grasps. The proposed approach is evaluated through simulationstudies and compared to existing approaches. The results demonstrate theeffectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting versatile and densegrasps, and in advancing the field of robotic grasping.</description><author>Philipp BlÃ¤ttner, Johannes Brand, Gerhard Neumann, Ngo Anh Vien</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 12:21:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00456v1</guid></item></channel></rss>

Inthis paper, we aim to explore the extent of FVD's bias toward per-frame qualityover temporal realism and identify its sources. We first quantify the FVD'ssensitivity to the temporal axis by decoupling the frame and motion quality andfind that the FVD increases only slightly with large temporal corruption. Wethen analyze the generated videos and show that via careful sampling from alarge set of generated videos that do not contain motions, one can drasticallydecrease FVD without improving the temporal quality. Both studies suggest FVD'sbias towards the quality of individual frames. We further observe that the biascan be attributed to the features extracted from a supervised video classifiertrained on the content-biased dataset. We show that FVD with features extractedfrom the recent large-scale self-supervised video models is less biased towardimage quality. Finally, we revisit a few real-world examples to validate ourhypothesis.</description><author>Songwei Ge, Aniruddha Mahapatra, Gaurav Parmar, Jun-Yan Zhu, Jia-Bin Huang</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 18:59:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12391v1</guid></item><item><title>NeRF-MAE: Masked AutoEncoders for Self-Supervised 3D Representation Learning for Neural Radiance Fields</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01300v2</link><description>Neural fields excel in computer vision and robotics due to their ability tounderstand the 3D visual world such as inferring semantics, geometry, anddynamics. Given the capabilities of neural fields in densely representing a 3Dscene from 2D images, we ask the question: Can we scale their self-supervisedpretraining, specifically using masked autoencoders, to generate effective 3Drepresentations from posed RGB images. Owing to the astounding success ofextending transformers to novel data modalities, we employ standard 3D VisionTransformers to suit the unique formulation of NeRFs. We leverage NeRF'svolumetric grid as a dense input to the transformer, contrasting it with other3D representations such as pointclouds where the information density can beuneven, and the representation is irregular. Due to the difficulty of applyingmasked autoencoders to an implicit representation, such as NeRF, we opt forextracting an explicit representation that canonicalizes scenes across domainsby employing the camera trajectory for sampling. Our goal is made possible bymasking random patches from NeRF's radiance and density grid and employing astandard 3D Swin Transformer to reconstruct the masked patches. In doing so,the model can learn the semantic and spatial structure of complete scenes. Wepretrain this representation at scale on our proposed curated posed-RGB data,totaling over 1.6 million images. Once pretrained, the encoder is used foreffective 3D transfer learning. Our novel self-supervised pretraining forNeRFs, NeRF-MAE, scales remarkably well and improves performance on variouschallenging 3D tasks. Utilizing unlabeled posed 2D data for pretraining,NeRF-MAE significantly outperforms self-supervised 3D pretraining and NeRFscene understanding baselines on Front3D and ScanNet datasets with an absoluteperformance improvement of over 20% AP50 and 8% AP25 for 3D object detection.</description><author>Muhammad Zubair Irshad, Sergey Zakahrov, Vitor Guizilini, Adrien Gaidon, Zsolt Kira, Rares Ambrus</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 18:59:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01300v2</guid></item><item><title>BLINK: Multimodal Large Language Models Can See but Not Perceive</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12390v1</link><description>We introduce Blink, a new benchmark for multimodal language models (LLMs)that focuses on core visual perception abilities not found in otherevaluations. Most of the Blink tasks can be solved by humans "within a blink"(e.g., relative depth estimation, visual correspondence, forensics detection,and multi-view reasoning). However, we find these perception-demanding taskscast significant challenges for current multimodal LLMs because they resistmediation through natural language. Blink reformats 14 classic computer visiontasks into 3,807 multiple-choice questions, paired with single or multipleimages and visual prompting. While humans get 95.70% accuracy on average, Blinkis surprisingly challenging for existing multimodal LLMs: even thebest-performing GPT-4V and Gemini achieve accuracies of 51.26% and 45.72%, only13.17% and 7.63% higher than random guessing, indicating that such perceptionabilities have not "emerged" yet in recent multimodal LLMs. Our analysis alsohighlights that specialist CV models could solve these problems much better,suggesting potential pathways for future improvements. We believe Blink willstimulate the community to help multimodal LLMs catch up with human-levelvisual perception.</description><author>Xingyu Fu, Yushi Hu, Bangzheng Li, Yu Feng, Haoyu Wang, Xudong Lin, Dan Roth, Noah A.

However, these approaches tend to generateblurrier results than their image counterparts as they are limited in theirgenerative capability. This raises a fundamental question: can we extend thesuccess of a generative image upsampler to the VSR task while preserving thetemporal consistency? We introduce VideoGigaGAN, a new generative VSR modelthat can produce videos with high-frequency details and temporal consistency.VideoGigaGAN builds upon a large-scale image upsampler -- GigaGAN. Simplyinflating GigaGAN to a video model by adding temporal modules produces severetemporal flickering. We identify several key issues and propose techniques thatsignificantly improve the temporal consistency of upsampled videos. Ourexperiments show that, unlike previous VSR methods, VideoGigaGAN generatestemporally consistent videos with more fine-grained appearance details. Wevalidate the effectiveness of VideoGigaGAN by comparing it withstate-of-the-art VSR models on public datasets and showcasing video resultswith $8\times$ super-resolution.</description><author>Yiran Xu, Taesung Park, Richard Zhang, Yang Zhou, Eli Shechtman, Feng Liu, Jia-Bin Huang, Difan Liu</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 18:59:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12388v1</guid></item><item><title>Moving Object Segmentation: All You Need Is SAM (and Flow)</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12389v1</link><description>The objective of this paper is motion segmentation -- discovering andsegmenting the moving objects in a video. This is a much studied area withnumerous careful,and sometimes complex, approaches and training schemesincluding: self-supervised learning, learning from synthetic datasets,object-centric representations, amodal representations, and many more. Ourinterest in this paper is to determine if the Segment Anything model (SAM) cancontribute to this task. We investigate two models for combining SAM withoptical flow that harness the segmentation power of SAM with the ability offlow to discover and group moving objects. In the first model, we adapt SAM totake optical flow, rather than RGB, as an input. In the second, SAM takes RGBas an input, and flow is used as a segmentation prompt. These surprisinglysimple methods, without any further modifications, outperform all previousapproaches by a considerable margin in both single and multi-object benchmarks.We also extend these frame-level segmentations to sequence-level segmentationsthat maintain object identity. Again, this simple model outperforms previousmethods on multiple video object segmentation benchmarks.</description><author>Junyu Xie, Charig Yang, Weidi Xie, Andrew Zisserman</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 18:59:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12389v1</guid></item><item><title>Reka Core, Flash, and Edge: A Series of Powerful Multimodal Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12387v1</link><description>We introduce Reka Core, Flash, and Edge, a series of powerful multimodallanguage models trained from scratch by Reka.

This work presentsSelf-supervised Open-world Hierarchical Entity Segmentation (SOHES), a novelapproach that eliminates the need for human annotations. SOHES operates inthree phases: self-exploration, self-instruction, and self-correction. Given apre-trained self-supervised representation, we produce abundant high-qualitypseudo-labels through visual feature clustering. Then, we train a segmentationmodel on the pseudo-labels, and rectify the noises in pseudo-labels via ateacher-student mutual-learning procedure. Beyond segmenting entities, SOHESalso captures their constituent parts, providing a hierarchical understandingof visual entities. Using raw images as the sole training data, our methodachieves unprecedented performance in self-supervised open-world segmentation,marking a significant milestone towards high-quality open-world entitysegmentation in the absence of human-annotated masks.

This allows for end-to-end meshreconstruction by fine-tuning a pre-trained NeRF LRM with mesh rendering.Moreover, we improve the LRM architecture by simplifying several complexdesigns in previous LRMs. MeshLRM's NeRF initialization is sequentially trainedwith low- and high-resolution images; this new LRM training strategy enablessignificantly faster convergence and thereby leads to better quality with lesscompute. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mesh reconstruction fromsparse-view inputs and also allows for many downstream applications, includingtext-to-3D and single-image-to-3D generation.

To learn a 3D spatial diffusion modelthat can capture this joint distribution, we represent the human hand via askeletal distance field to obtain a representation aligned with the (latent)signed distance field for the object. We show that this hand-object prior canthen serve as generic guidance to facilitate other tasks like reconstructionfrom interaction clip and human grasp synthesis. We believe that our model,trained by aggregating seven diverse real-world interaction datasets spanningacross 155 categories, represents a first approach that allows jointlygenerating both hand and object. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate thebenefit of this joint prior in video-based reconstruction and human graspsynthesis, outperforming current task-specific baselines.

Our approach targets interactive imageediting applications in which, starting from a blank canvas or an image, a userspecifies a sequence of localized image modifications using binary masks andtext prompts. Our generator operates in two phases. First, a context encoderprocesses the current canvas and user mask to produce a compact global contexttailored to the region to generate. Second, conditioned on this context, adiffusion-based transformer decoder synthesizes the masked pixels in a "lazy"fashion, i.e., it only generates the masked region. This contrasts withprevious works that either regenerate the full canvas, wasting time andcomputation, or confine processing to a tight rectangular crop around the mask,ignoring the global image context altogether. Our decoder's runtime scales withthe mask size, which is typically small, while our encoder introducesnegligible overhead. We demonstrate that our approach is competitive withstate-of-the-art inpainting methods in terms of quality and fidelity whileproviding a 10x speedup for typical user interactions, where the editing maskrepresents 10% of the image.</description><author>Yotam Nitzan, Zongze Wu, Richard Zhang, Eli Shechtman, Daniel Cohen-Or, Taesung Park, Micha√´l Gharbi</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 18:59:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12382v1</guid></item><item><title>6Img-to-3D: Few-Image Large-Scale Outdoor Driving Scene Reconstruction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12378v1</link><description>Current 3D reconstruction techniques struggle to infer unbounded scenes froma few images faithfully. Specifically, existing methods have high computationaldemands, require detailed pose information, and cannot reconstruct occludedregions reliably. We introduce 6Img-to-3D, an efficient, scalabletransformer-based encoder-renderer method for single-shot image to 3Dreconstruction. Our method outputs a 3D-consistent parameterized triplane fromonly six outward-facing input images for large-scale, unbounded outdoor drivingscenarios. We take a step towards resolving existing shortcomings by combiningcontracted custom cross- and self-attention mechanisms for triplaneparameterization, differentiable volume rendering, scene contraction, and imagefeature projection. We showcase that six surround-view vehicle images from asingle timestamp without global pose information are enough to reconstruct360$^{\circ}$ scenes during inference time, taking 395 ms. Our method allows,for example, rendering third-person images and birds-eye views.

However, it is still highlydifficult to obtain high-quality mesh in terms of structure and detail frommonocular visual observations. The problem becomes even more challenging fordynamic scenes and objects. To this end, we introduce Dynamic Gaussians Mesh(DG-Mesh), a framework to reconstruct a high-fidelity and time-consistent meshgiven a single monocular video. Our work leverages the recent advancement in 3DGaussian Splatting to construct the mesh sequence with temporal consistencyfrom a video. Building on top of this representation, DG-Mesh recovershigh-quality meshes from the Gaussian points and can track the mesh verticesover time, which enables applications such as texture editing on dynamicobjects. We introduce the Gaussian-Mesh Anchoring, which encourages evenlydistributed Gaussians, resulting better mesh reconstruction through mesh-guideddensification and pruning on the deformed Gaussians. By applyingcycle-consistent deformation between the canonical and the deformed space, wecan project the anchored Gaussian back to the canonical space and optimizeGaussians across all time frames. During the evaluation on different datasets,DG-Mesh provides significantly better mesh reconstruction and rendering thanbaselines.</description><author>Isabella Liu, Hao Su, Xiaolong Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 18:58:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12379v1</guid></item><item><title>Matching the Statistical Query Lower Bound for k-sparse Parity Problems with Stochastic Gradient Descent</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12376v1</link><description>The $k$-parity problem is a classical problem in computational complexity andalgorithmic theory, serving as a key benchmark for understanding computationalclasses. In this paper, we solve the $k$-parity problem with stochasticgradient descent (SGD) on two-layer fully-connected neural networks. Wedemonstrate that SGD can efficiently solve the $k$-sparse parity problem on a$d$-dimensional hypercube ($k\le O(\sqrt{d})$) with a sample complexity of$\tilde{O}(d^{k-1})$ using $2^{\Theta(k)}$ neurons, thus matching theestablished $\Omega(d^{k})$ lower bounds of Statistical Query (SQ) models. Ourtheoretical analysis begins by constructing a good neural network capable ofcorrectly solving the $k$-parity problem. We then demonstrate how a trainedneural network with SGD can effectively approximate this good network, solvingthe $k$-parity problem with small statistical errors. Our theoretical resultsand findings are supported by empirical evidence, showcasing the efficiency andefficacy of our approach.</description><author>Yiwen Kou, Zixiang Chen, Quanquan Gu, Sham M.

It assists medical experts to swiftly interpretmedical images, thereby enabling faster and more accurate diagnoses. However,the model interpretability and transparency of existing MedVQA solutions areoften limited, posing challenges in understanding their decision-makingprocesses. To address this issue, we devise a semi-automated annotation processto streamlining data preparation and build new benchmark MedVQA datasets R-RADand R-SLAKE. The R-RAD and R-SLAKE datasets provide intermediate medicaldecision-making rationales generated by multimodal large language models andhuman annotations for question-answering pairs in existing MedVQA datasets,i.e., VQA-RAD and SLAKE. Moreover, we design a novel framework which finetuneslightweight pretrained generative models by incorporating medicaldecision-making rationales into the training process. The framework includesthree distinct strategies to generate decision outcomes and correspondingrationales, thereby clearly showcasing the medical decision-making processduring reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achievean accuracy of 83.5% on R-RAD and 86.3% on R-SLAKE, significantly outperformingexisting state-of-the-art baselines.

Typically, in a VFL scenario, the labels of the samples arekept private from all the parties except for the aggregating server, that isthe label owner. Nevertheless, recent works discovered that by exploitinggradient information returned by the server to bottom models, with theknowledge of only a small set of auxiliary labels on a very limited subset oftraining data points, an adversary can infer the private labels. These attacksare known as label inference attacks in VFL. In our work, we propose a novelframework called KDk, that combines Knowledge Distillation and k-anonymity toprovide a defense mechanism against potential label inference attacks in a VFLscenario. Through an exhaustive experimental campaign we demonstrate that byapplying our approach, the performance of the analyzed label inference attacksdecreases consistently, even by more than 60%, maintaining the accuracy of thewhole VFL almost unaltered.</description><author>Marco Arazzi, Serena Nicolazzo, Antonino Nocera</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 18:51:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12369v1</guid></item><item><title>Gradient-Regularized Out-of-Distribution Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12368v1</link><description>One of the challenges for neural networks in real-life applications is theoverconfident errors these models make when the data is not from the originaltraining distribution. Addressing this issue is known as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. Many state-of-the-art OOD methods employ an auxiliary dataset as a surrogatefor OOD data during training to achieve improved performance. However, these methods fail to fully exploit the local information embeddedin the auxiliary dataset. In this work, we propose the idea of leveraging the information embedded inthe gradient of the loss function during training to enable the network to notonly learn a desired OOD score for each sample but also to exhibit similarbehavior in a local neighborhood around each sample. We also develop a novel energy-based sampling method to allow the network tobe exposed to more informative OOD samples during the training phase. This isespecially important when the auxiliary dataset is large. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on several OODbenchmarks, improving the existing state-of-the-art FPR95 by 4% on our ImageNetexperiment. We further provide a theoretical analysis through the lens of certifiedrobustness and Lipschitz analysis to showcase the theoretical foundation of ourwork.

Although individual methods have been proposed foreach of these tasks, they lack a common theoretical background integratingtheir solutions. Here, we introduce an information theoretical framework thatunifies predictions of phase transformations, kinetic events, datasetoptimality, and model-free UQ from atomistic simulations, thus bridgingmaterials modeling, ML, and statistical mechanics. We first demonstrate that,for a proposed representation, the information entropy of a distribution ofatom-centered environments is a surrogate value for thermodynamic entropy.Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that information entropydifferences from trajectories can be used to build phase diagrams, identifyrare events, and recover classical theories of nucleation. Building on theseresults, we use this general concept of entropy to quantify information indatasets for ML interatomic potentials (IPs), informing compression, explainingtrends in testing errors, and evaluating the efficiency of active learningstrategies. Finally, we propose a model-free UQ method for MLIPs usinginformation entropy, showing it reliably detects extrapolation regimes, scalesto millions of atoms, and goes beyond model errors.

In this position paper, we argue for the development of formalinteraction models which mathematically specify how AI and users shape oneanother. Formal interaction models can be leveraged to (1) specify interactionsfor implementation, (2) monitor interactions through empirical analysis, (3)anticipate societal impacts via counterfactual analysis, and (4) controlsocietal impacts via interventions. The design space of formal interactionmodels is vast, and model design requires careful consideration of factors suchas style, granularity, mathematical complexity, and measurability. Usingcontent recommender systems as a case study, we critically examine the nascentliterature of formal interaction models with respect to these use-cases anddesign axes.

To address this gap, we created a generative diffusionmodel-based reconstruction algorithm for multi-coil highly undersampled spiralMRI. This model uses conditioning during training as well as frequency-basedguidance to ensure consistency between images and measurements. Evaluated onretrospective data, we show high quality (structural similarity &gt; 0.87) inreconstructed images with ultrafast scan times (0.02 seconds for a 2D image).We use this algorithm to identify a set of optimal variable-density spiraltrajectories and show large improvements in image quality compared toconventional reconstruction using the non-uniform fast Fourier transform. Bycombining efficient spiral sampling trajectories, multicoil imaging, and deeplearning reconstruction, these methods could enable the extremely highacceleration factors needed for real-time 3D imaging.</description><author>Trevor J.

While this approach has allowed for empirical accuracy, efficiency,and task adaptation via fine-tuning, it also comes with fundamentaldisadvantages. Existing networks often struggle to generalize across differentdatasets, even on the same task. By design, these networks ultimately reasonabout high-dimensional scene features, which are challenging to analyze. Thisis true especially when attempting to predict 3D information based on 2Dimages. We propose to recast 3D multi-object tracking from RGB cameras as an\emph{Inverse Rendering (IR)} problem, by optimizing via a differentiablerendering pipeline over the latent space of pre-trained 3D objectrepresentations and retrieve the latents that best represent object instancesin a given input image. To this end, we optimize an image loss over generativelatent spaces that inherently disentangle shape and appearance properties. Weinvestigate not only an alternate take on tracking but our method also enablesexamining the generated objects, reasoning about failure situations, andresolving ambiguous cases. We validate the generalization and scalingcapabilities of our method by learning the generative prior exclusively fromsynthetic data and assessing camera-based 3D tracking on the nuScenes and Waymodatasets. Both these datasets are completely unseen to our method and do notrequire fine-tuning.

In response to thecomplex nature of the classical RLHF pipeline, direct alignment algorithms suchas Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as an alternativeapproach. Although DPO solves the same objective as the standard RLHF setup,there is a mismatch between the two approaches. Standard RLHF deploysreinforcement learning in a specific token-level MDP, while DPO is derived as abandit problem in which the whole response of the model is treated as a singlearm. In this work we rectify this difference, first we theoretically show thatwe can derive DPO in the token-level MDP as a general inverse Q-learningalgorithm, which satisfies the Bellman equation. Using our theoretical results,we provide three concrete empirical insights. First, we show that because ofits token level interpretation, DPO is able to perform some type of creditassignment. Next, we prove that under the token level formulation, classicalsearch-based algorithms, such as MCTS, which have recently been applied to thelanguage generation space, are equivalent to likelihood-based search on a DPOpolicy. Empirically we show that a simple beam search yields meaningfulimprovement over the base DPO policy. Finally, we show how the choice ofreference policy causes implicit rewards to decline during training.

Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, anotable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers theeffective fine-tuning of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs).Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-videosummarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video contentsummarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal tomultimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasksbased on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), anda combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textualsummaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address theseissues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization datasetfeaturing 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39\%.

However, itsapplication in 3D point cloud tasks remains largely unexplored. In this work,we introduce Point-In-Context (PIC), a novel framework for 3D point cloudunderstanding via in-context learning. We address the technical challenge ofeffectively extending masked point modeling to 3D point clouds by introducing aJoint Sampling module and proposing a vanilla version of PIC calledPoint-In-Context-Generalist (PIC-G). PIC-G is designed as a generalist modelfor various 3D point cloud tasks, with inputs and outputs modeled ascoordinates. In this paradigm, the challenging segmentation task is achieved byassigning label points with XYZ coordinates for each category; the finalprediction is then chosen based on the label point closest to the predictions.To break the limitation by the fixed label-coordinate assignment, which haspoor generalization upon novel classes, we propose two novel trainingstrategies, In-Context Labeling and In-Context Enhancing, forming an extendedversion of PIC named Point-In-Context-Segmenter (PIC-S), targeting improvingdynamic context labeling and model training. By utilizing dynamic in-contextlabels and extra in-context pairs, PIC-S achieves enhanced performance andgeneralization capability in and across part segmentation datasets. PIC is ageneral framework so that other tasks or datasets can be seamlessly introducedinto our PIC through a unified data format. We conduct extensive experiments tovalidate the versatility and adaptability of our proposed methods in handling awide range of tasks and segmenting multi-datasets.

ASR relies on extensive trainingdatasets, including confidential ones, and demands substantial computationaland storage resources. Enabling adaptive systems improves ASR performance indynamic environments. DL techniques assume training and testing data originatefrom the same domain, which is not always true. Advanced DL techniques likedeep transfer learning (DTL), federated learning (FL), and reinforcementlearning (RL) address these issues. DTL allows high-performance models usingsmall yet related datasets, FL enables training on confidential data withoutdataset possession, and RL optimizes decision-making in dynamic environments,reducing computation costs. This survey offers a comprehensive review of DTL,FL, and RL-based ASR frameworks, aiming to provide insights into the latestdevelopments and aid researchers and professionals in understanding the currentchallenges. Additionally, transformers, which are advanced DL techniquesheavily used in proposed ASR frameworks, are considered in this survey fortheir ability to capture extensive dependencies in the input ASR sequence. Thepaper starts by presenting the background of DTL, FL, RL, and Transformers andthen adopts a well-designed taxonomy to outline the state-of-the-artapproaches.

The prevailingapproach generally involves clustering across all data and learning conceptionsby prototypical contrastive learning. However, existing methods largely hingeon the performance of clustering algorithms and are thus subject to theirinherent limitations. Firstly, the estimated cluster number is often smallerthan the ground truth, making the existing methods suffer from the lack ofprototypes for comprehensive conception learning. To address this issue, wepropose an adaptive probing mechanism that introduces learnable potentialprototypes to expand cluster prototypes (centers). As there is no ground truthfor the potential prototype, we develop a self-supervised prototype learningframework to optimize the potential prototype in an end-to-end fashion.Secondly, clustering is computationally intensive, and the conventionalstrategy of clustering both labelled and unlabelled instances exacerbates thisissue. To counteract this inefficiency, we opt to cluster only the unlabelledinstances and subsequently expand the cluster prototypes with our introducedpotential prototypes to fast explore novel classes.

Traditional workflows to convert static clipartimages into motion sequences are laborious and time-consuming, involvingnumerous intricate steps like rigging, key animation and in-betweening. Recentadvancements in text-to-video generation hold great potential in resolving thisproblem. Nevertheless, direct application of text-to-video generation modelsoften struggles to retain the visual identity of clipart images or generatecartoon-style motions, resulting in unsatisfactory animation outcomes. In thispaper, we introduce AniClipart, a system that transforms static clipart imagesinto high-quality motion sequences guided by text-to-video priors. To generatecartoon-style and smooth motion, we first define B\'{e}zier curves overkeypoints of the clipart image as a form of motion regularization. We thenalign the motion trajectories of the keypoints with the provided text prompt byoptimizing the Video Score Distillation Sampling (VSDS) loss, which encodesadequate knowledge of natural motion within a pretrained text-to-videodiffusion model. With a differentiable As-Rigid-As-Possible shape deformationalgorithm, our method can be end-to-end optimized while maintaining deformationrigidity. Experimental results show that the proposed AniClipart consistentlyoutperforms existing image-to-video generation models, in terms of text-videoalignment, visual identity preservation, and motion consistency. Furthermore,we showcase the versatility of AniClipart by adapting it to generate a broaderarray of animation formats, such as layered animation, which allows topologicalchanges.</description><author>Ronghuan Wu, Wanchao Su, Kede Ma, Jing Liao</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 18:24:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12347v1</guid></item><item><title>Large Language Models in Targeted Sentiment Analysis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12342v1</link><description>In this paper we investigate the use of decoder-based generative transformersfor extracting sentiment towards the named entities in Russian news articles.We study sentiment analysis capabilities of instruction-tuned large languagemodels (LLMs).

The motivation is to better understand a model byquerying whether it is using information from human-understandable features,e.g., anatomical shape, volume, or image texture. Our method is based on theprinciple that if a model is dependent on a feature, then removal of thatfeature should significantly harm its performance. A targeted feature is"removed" by collapsing the dimension in the data distribution that correspondsto that feature. We perform this by moving data points along the featuredimension to a baseline feature value while staying on the data manifold, asestimated by a deep generative model. Then we observe how the model'sperformance changes on the modified test data set, with the target featuredimension removed. We test our method on deep neural network models trained onsynthetic image data with known ground truth, an Alzheimer's disease predictiontask using MRI and hippocampus segmentations from the OASIS-3 dataset, and acell nuclei classification task using the Lizard dataset.</description><author>Yinzhu Jin, Matthew B.

However,current methods often perform well only when there is a sufficient of observedinformation, and they perform poorly or may fail when the observed informationis less than 5\%. In order to improve the utilization of observed information,a new method called the tensor joint rank with logarithmic composite norm(TJLC) method is proposed. This method simultaneously exploits two types oftensor low-rank structures, namely tensor Tucker rank and tubal rank, therebyenhancing the inherent correlations between known and missing elements. Toaddress the challenge of applying two tensor ranks with significantly differentdirectly to LRTC, a new tensor Logarithmic composite norm is further proposed.Subsequently, the TJLC model and algorithm for the LRTC problem are proposed.Additionally, theoretical convergence guarantees for the TJLC method areprovided. Experiments on various real datasets demonstrate that the proposedmethod outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly. Particularly, theproposed method achieves satisfactory recovery even when the observedinformation is as low as 1\%, and the recovery performance improvessignificantly as the observed information increases.</description><author>Hongbing Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 18:08:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16208v2</guid></item><item><title>Efficient Sentiment Analysis: A Resource-Aware Evaluation of Feature Extraction Techniques, Ensembling, and Deep Learning Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02022v2</link><description>While reaching for NLP systems that maximize accuracy, other importantmetrics of system performance are often overlooked.

Our experiments considerdifferent feature extraction techniques, the effect of ensembling,task-specific deep learning modeling, and domain-independent large languagemodels (LLMs).

Due totheir black box nature, however, it may sometimes be hard to understand andtrust the results they provide. This has increased the demand for reliablevisualization tools related to enhancing trust in ML models, which has become aprominent topic of research in the visualization community over the pastdecades. To provide an overview and present the frontiers of current researchon the topic, we present a State-of-the-Art Report (STAR) on enhancing trust inML models with the use of interactive visualization. We define and describe thebackground of the topic, introduce a categorization for visualizationtechniques that aim to accomplish this goal, and discuss insights andopportunities for future research directions. Among our contributions is acategorization of trust against different facets of interactive ML, expandedand improved from previous research. Our results are investigated fromdifferent analytical perspectives: (a) providing a statistical overview, (b)summarizing key findings, (c) performing topic analyses, and (d) exploring thedata sets used in the individual papers, all with the support of an interactiveweb-based survey browser.

However, suchmethods lack accurate camera view control w.r.t the object, and users mustresort to prompt engineering (e.g., adding "top-view") to achieve coarse viewcontrol. In this work, we introduce a new task -- enabling explicit control ofcamera viewpoint for model customization. This allows us to modify objectproperties amongst various background scenes via text prompts, all whileincorporating the target camera pose as additional control. This new taskpresents significant challenges in merging a 3D representation from themulti-view images of the new concept with a general, 2D text-to-image model. Tobridge this gap, we propose to condition the 2D diffusion process on rendered,view-dependent features of the new object. During training, we jointly adaptthe 2D diffusion modules and 3D feature predictions to reconstruct the object'sappearance and geometry while reducing overfitting to the input multi-viewimages. Our method outperforms existing image editing and model personalizationbaselines in preserving the custom object's identity while following the inputtext prompt and the object's camera pose.</description><author>Nupur Kumari, Grace Su, Richard Zhang, Taesung Park, Eli Shechtman, Jun-Yan Zhu</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 17:59:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12333v1</guid></item><item><title>VisRuler: Visual Analytics for Extracting Decision Rules from Bagged and Boosted Decision Trees</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00334v5</link><description>Bagging and boosting are two popular ensemble methods in machine learning(ML) that produce many individual decision trees. Due to the inherent ensemblecharacteristic of these methods, they typically outperform single decisiontrees or other ML models in predictive performance. However, numerous decisionpaths are generated for each decision tree, increasing the overall complexityof the model and hindering its use in domains that require trustworthy andexplainable decisions, such as finance, social care, and health care. Thus, theinterpretability of bagging and boosting algorithms, such as random forest andadaptive boosting, reduces as the number of decisions rises. In this paper, wepropose a visual analytics tool that aims to assist users in extractingdecisions from such ML models via a thorough visual inspection workflow thatincludes selecting a set of robust and diverse models (originating fromdifferent ensemble learning algorithms), choosing important features accordingto their global contribution, and deciding which decisions are essential forglobal explanation (or locally, for specific cases). The outcome is a finaldecision based on the class agreement of several models and the explored manualdecisions exported by users. We evaluated the applicability and effectivenessof VisRuler via a use case, a usage scenario, and a user study.

A generalizableface landmarker is required in practice because real-world facial images, e.g.,the avatars in animations and games, are often stylized in various ways.However, achieving generalizable face landmarking is challenging due to thediversity of facial styles and the scarcity of labeled stylized faces. In thisstudy, we propose a simple but effective paradigm to learn a generalizable facelandmarker based on labeled real human faces and unlabeled stylized faces. Ourmethod learns the face landmarker as the key module of a conditional facewarper. Given a pair of real and stylized facial images, the conditional facewarper predicts a warping field from the real face to the stylized one, inwhich the face landmarker predicts the ending points of the warping field andprovides us with high-quality pseudo landmarks for the corresponding stylizedfacial images. Applying an alternating optimization strategy, we learn the facelandmarker to minimize $i)$ the discrepancy between the stylized faces and thewarped real ones and $ii)$ the prediction errors of both real and pseudolandmarks. Experiments on various datasets show that our method outperformsexisting state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods in face landmarking tasks,leading to a face landmarker with better generalizability.

Conventionally,adjoint solvers need to be implemented by differentiating computational models,which can be a cumbersome task and is code-specific. To propose an adjointsolver that is not code-specific, we develop a data-driven strategy. Wedemonstrate its application on the computation of gradients of long-timeaverages of chaotic flows. First, we deploy a parameter-aware echo statenetwork (ESN) to accurately forecast and simulate the dynamics of a dynamicalsystem for a range of system's parameters. Second, we derive the adjoint of theparameter-aware ESN. Finally, we combine the parameter-aware ESN with itsadjoint version to compute the sensitivities to the system parameters. Weshowcase the method on a prototypical chaotic system. Because adjointsensitivities in chaotic regimes diverge for long integration times, we analysethe application of ensemble adjoint method to the ESN. We find that the adjointsensitivities obtained from the ESN match closely with the original system.This work opens possibilities for sensitivity analysis without code-specificadjoint solvers.</description><author>Defne E.

A direct, model-agnostic, way tointerpret such models is to train surrogate models-such as rule sets anddecision trees-that sufficiently approximate the original ones while beingsimpler and easier-to-explain. Yet, rule sets can become very lengthy, withmany if-else statements, and decision tree depth grows rapidly when accuratelyemulating complex ML models. In such cases, both approaches can fail to meettheir core goal-providing users with model interpretability. To tackle this, wepropose DeforestVis, a visual analytics tool that offers summarization of thebehaviour of complex ML models by providing surrogate decision stumps(one-level decision trees) generated with the Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)technique. DeforestVis helps users to explore the complexity versus fidelitytrade-off by incrementally generating more stumps, creating attribute-basedexplanations with weighted stumps to justify decision making, and analysing theimpact of rule overriding on training instance allocation between one or morestumps. An independent test set allows users to monitor the effectiveness ofmanual rule changes and form hypotheses based on case-by-case analyses.

In particular, we restrict the functions to the class ofoverparameterized two-layer neural networks and study (i) the convergence ofthe gradient descent-ascent algorithm and (ii) the representation learning ofthe neural network. As an initial step, we consider the minimax optimizationproblem stemming from estimating a functional equation defined by conditionalexpectations via adversarial estimation, where the objective function isquadratic in the functional space. For this problem, we establish convergenceunder the mean-field regime by considering the continuous-time andinfinite-width limit of the optimization dynamics. Under this regime, gradientdescent-ascent corresponds to a Wasserstein gradient flow over the space ofprobability measures defined over the space of neural network parameters. Weprove that the Wasserstein gradient flow converges globally to a stationarypoint of the minimax objective at a $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1} + \alpha^{-1} ) $sublinear rate, and additionally finds the solution to the functional equationwhen the regularizer of the minimax objective is strongly convex. Here $T$denotes the time and $\alpha$ is a scaling parameter of the neural network. Interms of representation learning, our results show that the featurerepresentation induced by the neural networks is allowed to deviate from theinitial one by the magnitude of $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{-1})$, measured in termsof the Wasserstein distance.

Until now, the prevalent method to ascertainsuccess has been trial and error-testing crafted samples directly on the victimmodel. This approach, however, risks detection with every attempt, forcingattackers to either perfect their first try or face exposure. Our paperintroduces a ranking strategy that refines the transfer attack process,enabling the attacker to estimate the likelihood of success without repeatedtrials on the victim's system. By leveraging a set of diverse surrogate models,our method can predict transferability of adversarial examples. This strategycan be used to either select the best sample to use in an attack or the bestperturbation to apply to a specific sample. Using our strategy, we were able toraise the transferability of adversarial examples from a mere 20% - akin torandom selection-up to near upper-bound levels, with some scenarios evenwitnessing a 100% success rate. This substantial improvement not only shedslight on the shared susceptibilities across diverse architectures but alsodemonstrates that attackers can forego the detectable trial-and-error tacticsraising increasing the threat of surrogate-based attacks.</description><author>Mosh Levy, Guy Amit, Yuval Elovici, Yisroel Mirsky</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 17:41:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10878v2</guid></item><item><title>iRAG: An Incremental Retrieval Augmented Generation System for Videos</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12309v1</link><description>Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems combine the strengths oflanguage generation and information retrieval to power many real-worldapplications like chatbots. Use of RAG for combined understanding of multimodaldata such as text, images and videos is appealing but two critical limitationsexist: one-time, upfront capture of all content in large multimodal data astext descriptions entails high processing times, and not all information in therich multimodal data is typically in the text descriptions. Since the userqueries are not known apriori, developing a system for multimodal to textconversion and interactive querying of multimodal data is challenging. To address these limitations, we propose iRAG, which augments RAG with anovel incremental workflow to enable interactive querying of large corpus ofmultimodal data. Unlike traditional RAG, iRAG quickly indexes largerepositories of multimodal data, and in the incremental workflow, it uses theindex to opportunistically extract more details from select portions of themultimodal data to retrieve context relevant to an interactive user query. Suchan incremental workflow avoids long multimodal to text conversion times,overcomes information loss issues by doing on-demand query-specific extractionof details in multimodal data, and ensures high quality of responses tointeractive user queries that are often not known apriori.

Among aseries of diverse techniques to solve this problem, sampling algorithms areregarded as an efficient solution. However, the problem is more fundamental,with many works emphasizing the importance of instance hardness. This issuerefers to the significance of managing unsafe or potentially noisy instancesthat are more likely to be misclassified and serve as the root cause of poorclassification performance. This paper introduces HardVis, a visual analyticssystem designed to handle instance hardness mainly in imbalanced classificationscenarios. Our proposed system assists users in visually comparing differentdistributions of data types, selecting types of instances based on localcharacteristics that will later be affected by the active sampling method, andvalidating which suggestions from undersampling or oversampling techniques arebeneficial for the ML model. Additionally, rather than uniformlyundersampling/oversampling a specific class, we allow users to find and sampleeasy and difficult to classify training instances from all classes. Users canexplore subsets of data from different perspectives to decide all thoseparameters, while HardVis keeps track of their steps and evaluates the model'spredictive performance in a test set separately. The end result is awell-balanced data set that boosts the predictive power of the ML model. Theefficacy and effectiveness of HardVis are demonstrated with a hypotheticalusage scenario and a use case.

This process is computationallyintensive and requires an extensive search to infer the best hyperparameter setfor the given problem. The challenge is exacerbated by the fact that most MLmodels are complex internally, and training involves trial-and-error processesthat could remarkably affect the predictive result. Moreover, eachhyperparameter of an ML algorithm is potentially intertwined with the others,and changing it might result in unforeseeable impacts on the remaininghyperparameters.

To ensure both accuracy andefficiency, we present two strategies within the lightweight draft model.Firstly, we focus on capturing short-range dependencies at the bottom layer.Secondly, we leverage the readily available representations from the originalLLM.Through empirical evaluation on the Vicuna and LlaMA-2 series, Chimerademonstrates impressive results, achieving an average latency speedup ratio of2.7x compared to the vanilla auto-regressive decoding approach. This highlightsthe potential of our proposed framework in significantly improving theefficiency of large language models during the decoding process.</description><author>Ziqian Zeng, Jiahong Yu, Qianshi Pang, Zihao Wang, Huiping Zhuang, Hongen Shao, Xiaofeng Zou</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 17:23:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15758v2</guid></item><item><title>InstructIE: A Bilingual Instruction-based Information Extraction Dataset</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11527v3</link><description>Large language models can perform well on general natural language tasks, buttheir effectiveness is still not optimal for information extraction.

Recently, multiple studiesexplored the application of so-called self-attention mechanisms in the visiondomain. These studies often report empirical improvements over fullyconvolutional approaches on various datasets and tasks. To evaluate this trendfor medical imaging, we extend two widely adopted convolutional architectureswith different self-attention variants on two different medical datasets. Withthis, we aim to specifically evaluate the possible advantages of additionalself-attention. We compare our models with similarly sized convolutional andattention-based baselines and evaluate performance gains statistically.Additionally, we investigate how including such layers changes the featureslearned by these models during the training. Following a hyperparameter search,and contrary to our expectations, we observe no significant improvement inbalanced accuracy over fully convolutional models. We also find that importantfeatures, such as dermoscopic structures in skin lesion images, are still notlearned by employing self-attention. Finally, analyzing local explanations, weconfirm biased feature usage.

In some cases this slow evolution has been related to bettergeneralisation properties. We characterize this evolution for the broad classof noisy gradient descent systems in the limit of small step size. Our resultsshow that the structure of the noise affects not just the form of the limitingprocess, but also the time scale at which the evolution takes place.

If later such a bias is discovered duringinference or deployment, it is often necessary to acquire new data and retrainthe model. This behavior is especially problematic in critical areas such asautonomous driving or medical decision-making. In these scenarios, new data isoften expensive and hard to come by. In this work, we present a method based onchange penalization that takes a pre-trained model and adapts the weights tomitigate a previously detected bias. We achieve this by tuning azero-initialized copy of a frozen pre-trained network. Our method needs veryfew, in extreme cases only a single, examples that contradict the bias toincrease performance. Additionally, we propose an early stopping criterion tomodify baselines and reduce overfitting. We evaluate our approach on awell-known bias in skin lesion classification and three other datasets from thedomain shift literature.

We introduce anew suite of compression methods suitable for compression with biased inputsequences. Given $n$ points targeting the wrong distribution and quadratictime, Stein Kernel Thinning (SKT) returns $\sqrt{n}$ equal-weighted points with$\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/2})$ maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to $\mathbb {P}$. Forlarger-scale compression tasks, Low-rank SKT achieves the same feat insub-quadratic time using an adaptive low-rank debiasing procedure that may beof independent interest. For downstream tasks that support simplex orconstant-preserving weights, Stein Recombination and Stein Cholesky achieveeven greater parsimony, matching the guarantees of SKT with as few as$\operatorname{poly-log}(n)$ weighted points. Underlying these advances are newguarantees for the quality of simplex-weighted coresets, the spectral decay ofkernel matrices, and the covering numbers of Stein kernel Hilbert spaces.

SAM operates by generatingmasks based on various input prompts such as text, bounding boxes, points, ormasks, introducing a novel methodology to overcome the constraints posed bydataset-specific scarcity. While SAM is trained on an extensive dataset,comprising ~11M images, it mostly consists of natural photographic images withonly very limited images from other modalities. Whilst the rapid progress invisual infrared surveillance and X-ray security screening imaging technologies,driven forward by advances in deep learning, has significantly enhanced theability to detect, classify and segment objects with high accuracy, it is notevident if the SAM zero-shot capabilities can be transferred to suchmodalities. This work assesses SAM capabilities in segmenting objects ofinterest in the X-ray/infrared modalities. Our approach reuses the pre-trainedSAM with three different prompts: bounding box, centroid and random points. Wepresent quantitative/qualitative results to showcase the performance onselected datasets. Our results show that SAM can segment objects in the X-raymodality when given a box prompt, but its performance varies for point prompts.Specifically, SAM performs poorly in segmenting slender objects and organicmaterials, such as plastic bottles. We find that infrared objects are alsochallenging to segment with point prompts given the low-contrast nature of thismodality. This study shows that while SAM demonstrates outstanding zero-shotcapabilities with box prompts, its performance ranges from moderate to poor forpoint prompts, indicating that special consideration on the cross-modalgeneralisation of SAM is needed when considering use on X-ray/infrared imagery.</description><author>Yona Falinie A.

Stacking (also called "stacked generalization") is anensemble method that combines heterogeneous base models, arranged in at leastone layer, and then employs another metamodel to summarize the predictions ofthose models. Although it may be a highly-effective approach for increasing thepredictive performance of ML, generating a stack of models from scratch can bea cumbersome trial-and-error process. This challenge stems from the enormousspace of available solutions, with different sets of data instances andfeatures that could be used for training, several algorithms to choose from,and instantiations of these algorithms using diverse parameters (i.e., models)that perform differently according to various metrics. In this work, we presenta knowledge generation model, which supports ensemble learning with the use ofvisualization, and a visual analytics system for stacked generalization. Oursystem, StackGenVis, assists users in dynamically adapting performance metrics,managing data instances, selecting the most important features for a given dataset, choosing a set of top-performant and diverse algorithms, and measuring thepredictive performance. In consequence, our proposed tool helps users to decidebetween distinct models and to reduce the complexity of the resulting stack byremoving overpromising and underperforming models. The applicability andeffectiveness of StackGenVis are demonstrated with two use cases: a real-worldhealthcare data set and a collection of data related to sentiment/stancedetection in texts.

Recently, diffusion models are applied to the image classifiersto improve adversarial robustness through adversarial training or by purifyingadversarial noise. However, diffusion-based adversarial training oftenencounters convergence challenges and high computational expenses.Additionally, diffusion-based purification inevitably causes data shift and isdeemed susceptible to stronger adaptive attacks. To tackle these issues, wepropose the Truth Maximization Diffusion Classifier (TMDC), a generativeBayesian classifier that builds upon pre-trained diffusion models and theBayesian theorem. Unlike data-driven classifiers, TMDC, guided by Bayesianprinciples, utilizes the conditional likelihood from diffusion models todetermine the class probabilities of input images, thereby insulating againstthe influences of data shift and the limitations of adversarial training.Moreover, to enhance TMDC's resilience against more potent adversarial attacks,we propose an optimization strategy for diffusion classifiers. This strategyinvolves post-training the diffusion model on perturbed datasets withground-truth labels as conditions, guiding the diffusion model to learn thedata distribution and maximizing the likelihood under the ground-truth labels.The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR10dataset against heavy white-box attacks and strong adaptive attacks.Specifically, TMDC achieves robust accuracies of 82.81% against $l_{\infty}$norm-bounded perturbations and 86.05% against $l_{2}$ norm-boundedperturbations, respectively, with $\epsilon=0.05$.</description><author>Yujie Li, Yanbin Wang, Haitao Xu, Bin Liu, Jianguo Sun, Zhenhao Guo, Wenrui Ma</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 16:55:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08273v2</guid></item><item><title>DF-DM: A foundational process model for multimodal data fusion in the artificial intelligence era</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12278v1</link><description>In the big data era, integrating diverse data modalities poses significantchallenges, particularly in complex fields like healthcare.

However, the increasing size ofthese models and their limited access make improving their robustness achallenging task. Among various defense strategies, randomized smoothing hasshown great potential for LLMs, as it does not require full access to themodel's parameters or fine-tuning via adversarial training. However, randomizedsmoothing involves adding noise to the input before model prediction, and thefinal model's robustness largely depends on the model's performance on thesenoise corrupted data. Its effectiveness is often limited by the model'ssub-optimal performance on noisy data.

Aligning LLM-Assisted Evaluation of LLM Outputs with Human Preferences</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12272v1</link><description>Due to the cumbersome nature of human evaluation and limitations ofcode-based evaluation, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being usedto assist humans in evaluating LLM outputs. Yet LLM-generated evaluators simplyinherit all the problems of the LLMs they evaluate, requiring further humanvalidation. We present a mixed-initiative approach to ``validate thevalidators'' -- aligning LLM-generated evaluation functions (be it prompts orcode) with human requirements. Our interface, EvalGen, provides automatedassistance to users in generating evaluation criteria and implementingassertions. While generating candidate implementations (Python functions, LLMgrader prompts), EvalGen asks humans to grade a subset of LLM outputs; thisfeedback is used to select implementations that better align with user grades.A qualitative study finds overall support for EvalGen but underscores thesubjectivity and iterative process of alignment. In particular, we identify aphenomenon we dub \emph{criteria drift}: users need criteria to grade outputs,but grading outputs helps users define criteria. What is more, some criteriaappears \emph{dependent} on the specific LLM outputs observed (rather thanindependent criteria that can be defined \emph{a priori}), raising seriousquestions for approaches that assume the independence of evaluation fromobservation of model outputs. We present our interface and implementationdetails, a comparison of our algorithm with a baseline approach, andimplications for the design of future LLM evaluation assistants.</description><author>Shreya Shankar, J.

The use of physics knowledge allowsthe generative model to produce output in a controlled way, so that the output,by construction, complies with the physical laws. It imparts improvedgeneralization ability to extrapolate beyond the training distribution as wellas improved interpretability because the model is partly grounded in firmdomain knowledge. In this work, we aim to improve the fidelity ofreconstruction and robustness to noise in the physics integrated generativemodel. To this end, we use variational-autoencoder as a generative model. Toimprove the reconstruction results of the decoder, we propose to learn thelatent posterior distribution of both the physics as well as the trainabledata-driven components using planar normalizng flow. Normalizng flow basedposterior distribution harnesses the inherent dynamical structure of the datadistribution, hence the learned model gets closer to the true underlying datadistribution. To improve the robustness of generative model against noiseinjected in the model, we propose a modification in the encoder part of thenormalizing flow based VAE. We designed the encoder to incorporate scaled dotproduct attention based contextual information in the noisy latent vector whichwill mitigate the adverse effect of noise in the latent vector and make themodel more robust. We empirically evaluated our models on human locomotiondataset [33] and the results validate the efficacy of our proposed models interms of improvement in reconstruction quality as well as robustness againstnoise injected in the model.</description><author>Sheikh Waqas Akhtar</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 16:38:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12267v1</guid></item><item><title>Exposing Image Splicing Traces in Scientific Publications via Uncertainty-guided Refinement</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16388v2</link><description>Recently, a surge in scientific publications suspected of image manipulationhas led to numerous retractions, bringing the issue of image integrity intosharp focus. Although research on forensic detectors for image plagiarism andimage synthesis exists, the detection of image splicing traces in scientificpublications remains unexplored. Compared to image duplication and synthesis,image splicing detection is more challenging due to the lack of referenceimages and the typically small tampered areas. Furthermore, disruptive factorsin scientific images, such as artifacts from digital compression, abnormalpatterns, and noise from physical operations, present misleading features likesplicing traces, significantly increasing the difficulty of this task.Moreover, the scarcity of high-quality datasets of spliced scientific imageslimits potential advancements. In this work, we propose an Uncertainty-guidedRefinement Network (URN) to mitigate the impact of these disruptive factors.Our URN can explicitly suppress the propagation of unreliable information flowcaused by disruptive factors between regions, thus obtaining robust splicingfeatures. Additionally, the URN is designed to concentrate improvements inuncertain prediction areas during the decoding phase. We also construct adataset for image splicing detection (SciSp) containing 1,290 spliced images.Compared to existing datasets, SciSp includes the largest number of splicedimages and the most diverse sources. Comprehensive experiments conducted onthree benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. We alsovalidate the URN's generalisability in resisting cross-dataset domain shiftsand its robustness against various post-processing techniques, includingadvanced deep-learning-based inpainting.</description><author>Xun Lin, Wenzhong Tang, Haoran Wang, Yizhong Liu, Yakun Ju, Shuai Wang, Zitong Yu</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 16:32:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16388v2</guid></item><item><title>A Survey on the Densest Subgraph Problem and Its Variants</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14467v2</link><description>The Densest Subgraph Problem requires to find, in a given graph, a subset ofvertices whose induced subgraph maximizes a measure of density.

For a datasetof toxic online comments, where a state-of-the-art BERTopic model outputs"women, power, female," concept induction produces high-level concepts such as"Criticism of traditional gender roles" and "Dismissal of women's concerns." Wepresent LLooM, a concept induction algorithm that leverages large languagemodels to iteratively synthesize sampled text and propose human-interpretableconcepts of increasing generality. We then instantiate LLooM in amixed-initiative text analysis tool, enabling analysts to shift their attentionfrom interpreting topics to engaging in theory-driven analysis. Throughtechnical evaluations and four analysis scenarios ranging from literaturereview to content moderation, we find that LLooM's concepts improve upon theprior art of topic models in terms of quality and data coverage.

The primaryfocus of their research is to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency. Anautonomous vehicle has several modules responsible for one or more of theaforementioned items. Among these modules, the trajectory planner plays apivotal role in the safety of the vehicle and the comfort of its passengers.The module is also responsible for respecting kinematic constraints and anyapplicable road constraints. In this paper, a novel online spatial-temporalgraph trajectory planner is introduced to generate safe and comfortabletrajectories. First, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed using theautonomous vehicle, its surrounding vehicles, and virtual nodes along the roadwith respect to the vehicle itself. Next, the graph is forwarded into asequential network to obtain the desired states. To support the planner, asimple behavioral layer is also presented that determines kinematic constraintsfor the planner. Furthermore, a novel potential function is also proposed totrain the network. Finally, the proposed planner is tested on three differentcomplex driving tasks, and the performance is compared with two frequently usedmethods. The results show that the proposed planner generates safe and feasibletrajectories while achieving similar or longer distances in the forwarddirection and comparable comfort ride.</description><author>Jilan Samiuddin, Benoit Boulet, Di Wu</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 16:22:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12256v1</guid></item><item><title>Toward Self-Improvement of LLMs via Imagination, Searching, and Criticizing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12253v1</link><description>Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) onvarious tasks, they still struggle with scenarios that involves complexreasoning and planning. Recent work proposed advanced prompting techniques andthe necessity of fine-tuning with high-quality data to augment LLMs' reasoningabilities. However, these approaches are inherently constrained by dataavailability and quality. In light of this, self-correction and self-learningemerge as viable solutions, employing strategies that allow LLMs to refinetheir outputs and learn from self-assessed rewards.

As in many taskssufficient pixel-level labels are very difficult to obtain, we propose a methodwhich combines a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with unsupervised deep learningtechniques. In the standard GMM the pixel values with each sub-region aremodelled by a Gaussian distribution. In order to identify the differentregions, the parameter vector that minimizes the negative log-likelihood (NLL)function regarding the GMM has to be approximated. For this task, usuallyiterative optimization methods such as the expectation-maximization (EM)algorithm are used. In this paper, we propose to estimate these parametersdirectly from the image using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We thuschange the iterative procedure in the EM algorithm replacing theexpectation-step by a gradient-step with regard to the networks parameters.This means that the network is trained to minimize the NLL function of the GMMwhich comes with at least two advantages. As once trained, the network is ableto predict label probabilities very quickly compared with time consumingiterative optimization methods. Secondly, due to the deep image prior ourmethod is able to partially overcome one of the main disadvantages of GMM,which is not taking into account correlation between neighboring pixels, as itassumes independence between them. We demonstrate the advantages of our methodin various experiments on the example of myocardial infarct segmentation onmulti-sequence MRI images.</description><author>Matthias Schwab, Agnes Mayr, Markus Haltmeier</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 16:20:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12252v1</guid></item><item><title>Visualization for Trust in Machine Learning Revisited: The State of the Field in 2023</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12005v2</link><description>Visualization for explainable and trustworthy machine learning remains one ofthe most important and heavily researched fields within informationvisualization and visual analytics with various application domains, such asmedicine, finance, and bioinformatics.

One significant hurdle is how AI modelsmanage the absence of a particular modality - a frequent occurrence inreal-world situations.

In this area, a seemingly understudied problem is anomaly clustering,i.e., identifying and grouping different types of anomalies in a fullyunsupervised manner. In this work, we propose a novel method for clusteringanomalies in largely stationary images (textures) in a blind setting. That is,the input consists of normal and anomalous images without distinction andwithout labels. What contributes to the difficulty of the task is thatanomalous regions are often small and may present only subtle changes inappearance, which can be easily overshadowed by the genuine variance in thetexture. Moreover, each anomaly type may have a complex appearancedistribution. We introduce a novel scheme for solving this task using acombination of blind anomaly localization and contrastive learning. Byidentifying the anomalous regions with high fidelity, we can restrict our focusto those regions of interest; then, contrastive learning is employed toincrease the separability of different anomaly types and reduce the intra-classvariation. Our experiments show that the proposed solution yields significantlybetter results compared to prior work, setting a new state of the art.

Anotherissue is that most Transformer-based IR methods focus only on either local orglobal features, leading to limited receptive fields or deficient parameterissues. To address these problems, we propose a lightweight IR network,Reciprocal Attention Mixing Transformer (RAMiT). It employs our proposeddimensional reciprocal attention mixing Transformer (D-RAMiT) blocks, whichcompute bi-dimensional (spatial and channel) self-attentions in parallel withdifferent numbers of multi-heads. The bi-dimensional attentions help each otherto complement their counterpart's drawbacks and are then mixed. Additionally,we introduce a hierarchical reciprocal attention mixing (H-RAMi) layer thatcompensates for pixel-level information losses and utilizes semanticinformation while maintaining an efficient hierarchical structure.

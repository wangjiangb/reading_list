Despitenotable advancements in single object 3D shape completion, high-qualityreconstructions in highly cluttered real-world multi-object scenes remains achallenge. To address this issue, we propose OctMAE, an architecture thatleverages an Octree U-Net and a latent 3D MAE to achieve high-quality and nearreal-time multi-object shape completion through both local and global geometricreasoning. Because a na\"ive 3D MAE can be computationally intractable andmemory intensive even in the latent space, we introduce a novel occlusionmasking strategy and adopt 3D rotary embeddings, which significantly improvesthe runtime and shape completion quality. To generalize to a wide range ofobjects in diverse scenes, we create a large-scale photorealistic dataset,featuring a diverse set of 12K 3D object models from the Objaverse datasetwhich are rendered in multi-object scenes with physics-based positioning. Ourmethod outperforms the current state-of-the-art on both synthetic andreal-world datasets and demonstrates a strong zero-shot capability.</description><author>Shun Iwase, Katherine Liu, Vitor Guizilini, Adrien Gaidon, Kris Kitani, Rares Ambrus, Sergey Zakharov</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 18:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14628v1</guid></item><item><title>MVSplat: Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting from Sparse Multi-View Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14627v1</link><description>We propose MVSplat, an efficient feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting modellearned from sparse multi-view images. To accurately localize the Gaussiancenters, we propose to build a cost volume representation via plane sweeping inthe 3D space, where the cross-view feature similarities stored in the costvolume can provide valuable geometry cues to the estimation of depth. We learnthe Gaussian primitives' opacities, covariances, and spherical harmonicscoefficients jointly with the Gaussian centers while only relying onphotometric supervision. We demonstrate the importance of the cost volumerepresentation in learning feed-forward Gaussian Splatting models via extensiveexperimental evaluations. On the large-scale RealEstate10K and ACID benchmarks,our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with the fastest feed-forwardinference speed (22 fps).

In this paper, we propose ODTFormer, a Transformer-basedmodel to address both obstacle detection and tracking problems. For thedetection task, our approach leverages deformable attention to construct a 3Dcost volume, which is decoded progressively in the form of voxel occupancygrids. We further track the obstacles by matching the voxels betweenconsecutive frames. The entire model can be optimized in an end-to-end manner.Through extensive experiments on DrivingStereo and KITTI benchmarks, our modelachieves state-of-the-art performance in the obstacle detection task. We alsoreport comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art obstacle tracking models whilerequiring only a fraction of their computation cost, typically ten-fold totwenty-fold less.

Our Lightweight Feature Transform (LiFT)is a straightforward and compact postprocessing network that can be applied toenhance the features of any pre-trained ViT backbone. LiFT is fast and easy totrain with a self-supervised objective, and it boosts the density of ViTfeatures for minimal extra inference cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate thatLiFT can be applied with approaches that use additional task-specificdownstream modules, as we integrate LiFT with ViTDet for COCO detection andsegmentation. Despite the simplicity of LiFT, we find that it is not simplylearning a more complex version of bilinear interpolation. Instead, our LiFTtraining protocol leads to several desirable emergent properties that benefitViT features in dense downstream tasks. This includes greater scale invariancefor features, and better object boundary maps. By simply training LiFT for afew epochs, we show improved performance on keypoint correspondence, detection,segmentation, and object discovery tasks. Overall, LiFT provides an easy way tounlock the benefits of denser feature arrays for a fraction of thecomputational cost.

However, their capabilities in visual math problem-solving remaininsufficiently evaluated and understood. We investigate current benchmarks toincorporate excessive visual content within textual questions, whichpotentially assist MLLMs in deducing answers without truly interpreting theinput diagrams. To this end, we introduce MathVerse, an all-around visual mathbenchmark designed for an equitable and in-depth evaluation of MLLMs. Wemeticulously collect 2,612 high-quality, multi-subject math problems withdiagrams from publicly available sources. Each problem is then transformed byhuman annotators into six distinct versions, each offering varying degrees ofinformation content in multi-modality, contributing to 15K test samples intotal. This approach allows MathVerse to comprehensively assess whether and howmuch MLLMs can truly understand the visual diagrams for mathematical reasoning.In addition, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy for afine-grained assessment of the output answers. Rather than naively judging Trueor False, we employ GPT-4(V) to adaptively extract crucial reasoning steps, andthen score each step with detailed error analysis, which can reveal theintermediate CoT reasoning quality by MLLMs. We hope the MathVerse benchmarkmay provide unique insights to guide the future development of MLLMs. Projectpage: https://mathverse-cuhk.github.io</description><author>Renrui Zhang, Dongzhi Jiang, Yichi Zhang, Haokun Lin, Ziyu Guo, Pengshuo Qiu, Aojun Zhou, Pan Lu, Kai-Wei Chang, Peng Gao, Hongsheng Li</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 18:59:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14624v1</guid></item><item><title>Simplified Diffusion Schr√∂dinger Bridge</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14623v1</link><description>This paper introduces a novel theoretical simplification of the DiffusionSchr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) that facilitates its unification with Score-basedGenerative Models (SGMs), addressing the limitations of DSB in complex datageneration and enabling faster convergence and enhanced performance.

Thisbecomes critical, especially in applications such as long-form videounderstanding. In this paper, we introduce a Language Repository (LangRepo) forLLMs, that maintains concise and structured information as an interpretable(i.e., all-textual) representation. Our repository is updated iteratively basedon multi-scale video chunks. We introduce write and read operations that focuson pruning redundancies in text, and extracting information at various temporalscales.

Contemporary approaches typicallyleverage 2D machine-generated segments, integrating them for 3D consistency.While the majority of these methods are based on NeRFs, they face a potentialweakness that the instance/semantic embedding features derive from independentMLPs, thus preventing the segmentation network from learning the geometricdetails of the objects directly through radiance and density. In this paper, wepropose ClusteringSDF, a novel approach to achieve both segmentation andreconstruction in 3D via the neural implicit surface representation,specifically Signal Distance Function (SDF), where the segmentation renderingis directly integrated with the volume rendering of neural implicit surfaces.Although based on ObjectSDF++, ClusteringSDF no longer requires theground-truth segments for supervision while maintaining the capability ofreconstructing individual object surfaces, but purely with the noisy andinconsistent labels from pre-trained models.As the core of ClusteringSDF, weintroduce a high-efficient clustering mechanism for lifting the 2D labels to 3Dand the experimental results on the challenging scenes from ScanNet and Replicadatasets show that ClusteringSDF can achieve competitive performance comparedagainst the state-of-the-art with significantly reduced training time.</description><author>Tianhao Wu, Chuanxia Zheng, Tat-Jen Cham, Qianyi Wu</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 18:59:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14619v1</guid></item><item><title>Videoshop: Localized Semantic Video Editing with Noise-Extrapolated Diffusion Inversion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14617v1</link><description>We introduce Videoshop, a training-free video editing algorithm for localizedsemantic edits. Videoshop allows users to use any editing software, includingPhotoshop and generative inpainting, to modify the first frame; itautomatically propagates those changes, with semantic, spatial, and temporallyconsistent motion, to the remaining frames. Unlike existing methods that enableedits only through imprecise textual instructions, Videoshop allows users toadd or remove objects, semantically change objects, insert stock photos intovideos, etc. with fine-grained control over locations and appearance. Weachieve this through image-based video editing by inverting latents with noiseextrapolation, from which we generate videos conditioned on the edited image.Videoshop produces higher quality edits against 6 baselines on 2 editingbenchmarks using 10 evaluation metrics.</description><author>Xiang Fan, Anand Bhattad, Ranjay Krishna</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 18:59:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14617v1</guid></item><item><title>Hierarchical Text-to-Vision Self Supervised Alignment for Improved Histopathology Representation Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14616v1</link><description>Self-supervised representation learning has been highly promising forhistopathology image analysis with numerous approaches leveraging theirpatient-slide-patch hierarchy to learn better representations.

These degradations typicallyarise from the inherent limitations of cameras or unfavorable ambientconditions. To recover clean images from degraded versions, numerousspecialized restoration methods have been developed, each targeting a specifictype of degradation. Recently, all-in-one algorithms have garnered significantattention by addressing different types of degradations within a single modelwithout requiring prior information of the input degradation type. However,these methods purely operate in the spatial domain and do not delve into thedistinct frequency variations inherent to different degradation types. Toaddress this gap, we propose an adaptive all-in-one image restoration networkbased on frequency mining and modulation. Our approach is motivated by theobservation that different degradation types impact the image content ondifferent frequency subbands, thereby requiring different treatments for eachrestoration task. Specifically, we first mine low- and high-frequencyinformation from the input features, guided by the adaptively decoupled spectraof the degraded image. The extracted features are then modulated by abidirectional operator to facilitate interactions between different frequencycomponents. Finally, the modulated features are merged into the original inputfor a progressively guided restoration. With this approach, the model achievesadaptive reconstruction by accentuating the informative frequency subbandsaccording to different input degradations. Extensive experiments demonstratethat the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on differentimage restoration tasks, including denoising, dehazing, deraining, motiondeblurring, and low-light image enhancement.

In this paper, we present a comprehensiveframework, coined DreamReward, to learn and improve text-to-3D models fromhuman preference feedback. To begin with, we collect 25k expert comparisonsbased on a systematic annotation pipeline including rating and ranking. Then,we build Reward3D -- the first general-purpose text-to-3D human preferencereward model to effectively encode human preferences. Building upon the 3Dreward model, we finally perform theoretical analysis and present the Reward3DFeedback Learning (DreamFL), a direct tuning algorithm to optimize themulti-view diffusion models with a redefined scorer.

Our objective is to fully leverage the inherentgeneralization capability of an image-to-video model without additionaltraining or fine-tuning of the original model. This is achieved through theproposed new sampling strategy, which we call Time Reversal Fusion, that fusesthe temporally forward and backward denoising paths conditioned on the startand end frame, respectively. The fused path results in a video that smoothlyconnects the two frames, generating inbetweening of faithful subject motion,novel views of static scenes, and seamless video looping when the two boundingframes are identical. We curate a diverse evaluation dataset of image pairs andcompare against the closest existing methods. We find that Time Reversal Fusionoutperforms related work on all subtasks, exhibiting the ability to generatecomplex motions and 3D-consistent views guided by bounded frames.

Recognizing the complementary strengths andweaknesses of both text and visual prompts, we introduce T-Rex2 that synergizesboth prompts within a single model through contrastive learning. T-Rex2 acceptsinputs in diverse formats, including text prompts, visual prompts, and thecombination of both, so that it can handle different scenarios by switchingbetween the two prompt modalities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate thatT-Rex2 exhibits remarkable zero-shot object detection capabilities across awide spectrum of scenarios. We show that text prompts and visual prompts canbenefit from each other within the synergy, which is essential to cover massiveand complicated real-world scenarios and pave the way towards generic objectdetection.

There has been a variety of tasks thataim to automatically interpret, augment, and query tables. Current methodsoften require pretraining on tables or special model architecture design, arerestricted to specific table types, or have simplifying assumptions abouttables and tasks. This paper makes the first step towards developingopen-source large language models (LLMs) as generalists for a diversity oftable-based tasks. Towards that end, we construct TableInstruct, a new datasetwith a variety of realistic tables and tasks, for instruction tuning andevaluating LLMs. We further develop the first open-source generalist model fortables, TableLlama, by fine-tuning Llama 2 (7B) with LongLoRA to address thelong context challenge. We experiment under both in-domain setting andout-of-domain setting. On 7 out of 8 in-domain tasks, TableLlama achievescomparable or better performance than the SOTA for each task, despite thelatter often has task-specific design. On 6 out-of-domain datasets, it achieves5-44 absolute point gains compared with the base model, showing that trainingon TableInstruct enhances the model's generalizability. We open-source ourdataset and trained model to boost future work on developing open generalistmodels for tables.</description><author>Tianshu Zhang, Xiang Yue, Yifei Li, Huan Sun</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 18:56:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09206v2</guid></item><item><title>TD-MPC2: Scalable, Robust World Models for Continuous Control</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16828v2</link><description>TD-MPC is a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that performslocal trajectory optimization in the latent space of a learned implicit(decoder-free) world model.

However, theirunprecedented scale comes with significant computational costs. These models,often consisting of billions of parameters, require vast amounts ofcomputational resources for execution. Especially, the expansive scale andcomputational demands pose considerable challenges when customizing them forparticular downstream tasks, particularly over the hardware platformsconstrained by computational capabilities. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) provides a practical solution by efficiently adapt the large models overthe various downstream tasks. In particular, PEFT refers to the process ofadjusting the parameters of a pre-trained large models to adapt it to aspecific task while minimizing the number of additional parameters introducedor computational resources required. This approach is particularly importantwhen dealing with large language models with high parameter counts, asfine-tuning these models from scratch can be computationally expensive andresource-intensive, posing considerable challenges in the supporting systemplatform design. In this survey, we present comprehensive studies of variousPEFT algorithms, examining their performance and computational overhead.Moreover, we provide an overview of applications developed using different PEFTalgorithms and discuss common techniques employed to mitigate computation costsfor PEFT. In addition to the algorithmic perspective, we overview variousreal-world system designs to investigate the implementation costs associatedwith different PEFT algorithms.

This new programmingparadigm enables end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs(including those with control flows and data structures), making gradient-basedoptimization of program parameters possible. As an emerging paradigm,differentiable programming builds upon several areas of computer science andapplied mathematics, including automatic differentiation, graphical models,optimization and statistics. This book presents a comprehensive review of thefundamental concepts useful for differentiable programming. We adopt two mainperspectives, that of optimization and that of probability, with clearanalogies between the two. Differentiable programming is not merely thedifferentiation of programs, but also the thoughtful design of programsintended for differentiation. By making programs differentiable, we inherentlyintroduce probability distributions over their execution, providing a means toquantify the uncertainty associated with program outputs.</description><author>Mathieu Blondel, Vincent Roulet</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 18:55:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14606v1</guid></item><item><title>CryCeleb: A Speaker Verification Dataset Based on Infant Cry Sounds</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00969v7</link><description>This paper describes the Ubenwa CryCeleb dataset - a labeled collection ofinfant cries - and the accompanying CryCeleb 2023 task, which is a publicspeaker verification challenge based on cry sounds.

However, applying these methods to real imagesnecessitates the inversion of the images into the domain of the pretraineddiffusion model. Achieving faithful inversion remains a challenge, particularlyfor more recent models trained to generate images with a small number ofdenoising steps. In this work, we introduce an inversion method with a highquality-to-operation ratio, enhancing reconstruction accuracy withoutincreasing the number of operations. Building on reversing the diffusionsampling process, our method employs an iterative renoising mechanism at eachinversion sampling step. This mechanism refines the approximation of apredicted point along the forward diffusion trajectory, by iteratively applyingthe pretrained diffusion model, and averaging these predictions. We evaluatethe performance of our ReNoise technique using various sampling algorithms andmodels, including recent accelerated diffusion models. Through comprehensiveevaluations and comparisons, we show its effectiveness in terms of bothaccuracy and speed.

To effectively recognize a variety of user-specificconcepts, we augment the VLM with external concept heads that function astoggles for the model, enabling the VLM to identify the presence of specifictarget concepts in a given image. Having recognized the concept, we learn a newconcept embedding in the intermediate feature space of the VLM. This embeddingis tasked with guiding the language model to naturally integrate the targetconcept in its generated response. We apply our technique to BLIP-2 and LLaVAfor personalized image captioning and further show its applicability forpersonalized visual question-answering. Our experiments demonstrate our abilityto generalize to unseen images of learned concepts while preserving the modelbehavior on unrelated inputs.</description><author>Yuval Alaluf, Elad Richardson, Sergey Tulyakov, Kfir Aberman, Daniel Cohen-Or</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 18:51:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14599v1</guid></item><item><title>PSALM: Pixelwise SegmentAtion with Large Multi-Modal Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14598v1</link><description>PSALM is a powerful extension of the Large Multi-modal Model (LMM) to addressthe segmentation task challenges. To overcome the limitation of the LMM beinglimited to textual output, PSALM incorporates a mask decoder and awell-designed input schema to handle a variety of segmentation tasks. Thisschema includes images, task instructions, conditional prompts, and masktokens, which enable the model to generate and classify segmentation maskseffectively. The flexible design of PSALM supports joint training acrossmultiple datasets and tasks, leading to improved performance and taskgeneralization. PSALM achieves superior results on several benchmarks, such asRefCOCO/RefCOCO+/RefCOCOg, COCO Panoptic Segmentation, and COCO-Interactive,and further exhibits zero-shot capabilities on unseen tasks, such asopen-vocabulary segmentation, generalized referring expression segmentation andvideo object segmentation, making a significant step towards a GPT moment incomputer vision. Through extensive experiments, PSALM demonstrates itspotential to transform the domain of image segmentation, leveraging the robustvisual understanding capabilities of LMMs as seen in natural languageprocessing.

We begin withsubstituting the built-in algorithm in AIRL with soft actor-critic (SAC) duringthe policy optimization process to enhance sample efficiency, thanks to theoff-policy formulation of SAC and identifiable Markov decision process (MDP)models with respect to AIRL. It indeed exhibits a significant improvement inpolicy imitation but accidentally brings drawbacks to transferable rewardrecovery. To learn this issue, we illustrate that the SAC algorithm itself isnot feasible to disentangle the reward function comprehensively during the AIRLtraining process, and propose a hybrid framework, PPO-AIRL + SAC, forsatisfactory transfer effect.

Recently, efforts have been made to trainlanguage agents for performance improvement, with multi-step reasoning andaction trajectories as the training data. However, collecting such trajectoriesstill requires considerable human effort, by either artificial annotations orimplementations of diverse prompting frameworks. In this work, we proposeA$^3$T, a framework that enables the Autonomous Annotation of AgentTrajectories in the style of ReAct. The central role is an ActRe promptingagent, which explains the reason for an arbitrary action. When randomlysampling an external action, the ReAct-style agent could query the ActRe agentwith the action to obtain its textual rationales. Novel trajectories are thensynthesized by prepending the posterior reasoning from ActRe to the sampledaction. In this way, the ReAct-style agent executes multiple trajectories forthe failed tasks, and selects the successful ones to supplement its failedtrajectory for contrastive self-training. Realized by policy gradient methodswith binarized rewards, the contrastive self-training with accumulatedtrajectories facilitates a closed loop for multiple rounds of language agentself-improvement. We conduct experiments using QLoRA fine-tuning with theopen-sourced Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. In AlfWorld, the agent trained withA$^3$T obtains a 1-shot success rate of 96%, and 100% success with 4 iterativerounds. In WebShop, the 1-shot performance of the A$^3$T agent matches humanaverage, and 4 rounds of iterative refinement lead to the performanceapproaching human experts. A$^3$T agents significantly outperform existingtechniques, including prompting with GPT-4, advanced agent frameworks, andfully fine-tuned LLMs.</description><author>Zonghan Yang, Peng Li, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Yang Liu</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 18:43:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14589v1</guid></item><item><title>An Analysis of Linear Time Series Forecasting Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14587v1</link><description>Despite their simplicity, linear models perform well at time seriesforecasting, even when pitted against deeper and more expensive models. Anumber of variations to the linear model have been proposed, often includingsome form of feature normalisation that improves model generalisation. In thispaper we analyse the sets of functions expressible using these linear modelarchitectures. In so doing we show that several popular variants of linearmodels for time series forecasting are equivalent and functionallyindistinguishable from standard, unconstrained linear regression. Wecharacterise the model classes for each linear variant. We demonstrate thateach model can be reinterpreted as unconstrained linear regression over asuitably augmented feature set, and therefore admit closed-form solutions whenusing a mean-squared loss function. We provide experimental evidence that themodels under inspection learn nearly identical solutions, and finallydemonstrate that the simpler closed form solutions are superior forecastersacross 72% of test settings.</description><author>William Toner, Luke Darlow</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 18:42:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14587v1</guid></item><item><title>Co-Optimization of Environment and Policies for Decentralized Multi-Agent Navigation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14583v1</link><description>This work views the multi-agent system and its surrounding environment as aco-evolving system, where the behavior of one affects the other. The goal is totake both agent actions and environment configurations as decision variables,and optimize these two components in a coordinated manner to improve somemeasure of interest. Towards this end, we consider the problem of decentralizedmulti-agent navigation in cluttered environments. By introducing twosub-objectives of multi-agent navigation and environment optimization, wepropose an $\textit{agent-environment co-optimization}$ problem and develop a$\textit{coordinated algorithm}$ that alternates between these sub-objectivesto search for an optimal synthesis of agent actions and obstacle configurationsin the environment; ultimately, improving the navigation performance. Due tothe challenge of explicitly modeling the relation between agents, environmentand performance, we leverage policy gradient to formulate a model-free learningmechanism within the coordinated framework. A formal convergence analysis showsthat our coordinated algorithm tracks the local minimum trajectory of anassociated time-varying non-convex optimization problem. Extensive numericalresults corroborate theoretical findings and show the benefits ofco-optimization over baselines. Interestingly, the results also indicate thatoptimized environment configurations are able to offer structural guidance thatis key to de-conflicting agents in motion.</description><author>Zhan Gao, Guang Yang, Amanda Prorok</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 18:37:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14583v1</guid></item><item><title>Large Language Models for Multi-Choice Question Classification of Medical Subjects</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14582v1</link><description>The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether large language models trained onmulti-choice question data can be used to discriminate between medicalsubjects.

Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) settingspresent additional challenges, and successful cooperation in mixed-motivegroups of agents depends on a delicate balancing act between individual andgroup objectives. Social conventions and norms, often inspired by humaninstitutions, are used as tools for striking this balance. In this paper, we examine a fundamental, well-studied social convention thatunderlies cooperation in both animal and human societies: dominancehierarchies. We adapt the ethological theory of dominance hierarchies to artificialagents, borrowing the established terminology and definitions with as fewamendments as possible. We demonstrate that populations of RL agents, operatingwithout explicit programming or intrinsic rewards, can invent, learn, enforce,and transmit a dominance hierarchy to new populations. The dominancehierarchies that emerge have a similar structure to those studied in chickens,mice, fish, and other species.</description><author>Ram Rachum, Yonatan Nakar, Bill Tomlinson, Nitay Alon, Reuth Mirsky</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 18:29:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12258v5</guid></item><item><title>Unveiling Typographic Deceptions: Insights of the Typographic Vulnerability in Large Vision-Language Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19150v2</link><description>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) rely on vision encoders and LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) to exhibit remarkable capabilities on variousmulti-modal tasks in the joint space of vision and language.

Tool-augmented LLMs hold tremendous promise forautomating the generation of such computational plans. However, the lack ofstandardized benchmarks for evaluating LLMs as planners for multi-stepmulti-modal tasks has prevented a systematic study of planner design decisions.Should LLMs generate a full plan in a single shot or step-by-step? Should theyinvoke tools directly with Python code or through structured data formats likeJSON? Does feedback improve planning? To answer these questions and more, weintroduce m&amp;m's: a benchmark containing 4K+ multi-step multi-modal tasksinvolving 33 tools that include multi-modal models, (free) public APIs, andimage processing modules. For each of these task queries, we provideautomatically generated plans using this realistic toolset. We further providea high-quality subset of 1,565 task plans that are human-verified and correctlyexecutable. With m&amp;m's, we evaluate 6 popular LLMs with 2 planning strategies(multi-step vs. step-by-step planning), 2 plan formats (JSON vs. code), and 3types of feedback (parsing/verification/execution).

The separation of style and content is essential formanipulating the image's style independently from its content, ensuring aharmonious and visually pleasing result. Achieving this separation requires adeep understanding of both the visual and semantic characteristics of images,often necessitating the training of specialized models or employing heavyoptimization. In this paper, we introduce B-LoRA, a method that leverages LoRA(Low-Rank Adaptation) to implicitly separate the style and content componentsof a single image, facilitating various image stylization tasks. By analyzingthe architecture of SDXL combined with LoRA, we find that jointly learning theLoRA weights of two specific blocks (referred to as B-LoRAs) achievesstyle-content separation that cannot be achieved by training each B-LoRAindependently. Consolidating the training into only two blocks and separatingstyle and content allows for significantly improving style manipulation andovercoming overfitting issues often associated with model fine-tuning.

These principles play a vital role in optimizingvarious aspects of model pre-training, ultimately contributing to the successof large language models such as GPT-4, Llama and Gemini. However, the originalscaling law paper by OpenAI did not disclose the complete details necessary toderive the precise scaling law formulas, and their conclusions are only basedon models containing up to 1.5 billion parameters.

Specifically, we conceptualize LLMs as semantic processorsthat manipulate meaningful pieces of information that we call semantic tokens(known thoughts). LLMs are among a large pool of other semantic processors,including humans and tools, such as search engines or code executors.Collectively, semantic processors engage in dynamic exchanges of semantictokens to progressively construct high-utility outputs. We refer to theseorchestrated interactions among semantic processors, optimizing and searchingin semantic space, as semantic decoding algorithms. This concept draws a directparallel to the well-studied problem of syntactic decoding, which involvescrafting algorithms to best exploit auto-regressive language models forextracting high-utility sequences of syntactic tokens. By focusing on thesemantic level and disregarding syntactic details, we gain a fresh perspectiveon the engineering of AI systems, enabling us to imagine systems with muchgreater complexity and capabilities. In this position paper, we formalize thetransition from syntactic to semantic tokens as well as the analogy betweensyntactic and semantic decoding. Subsequently, we explore the possibilities ofoptimizing within the space of semantic tokens via semantic decodingalgorithms. We conclude with a list of research opportunities and questionsarising from this fresh perspective. The semantic decoding perspective offers apowerful abstraction for search and optimization directly in the space ofmeaningful concepts, with semantic tokens as the fundamental units of a newtype of computation.</description><author>Maxime Peyrard, Martin Josifoski, Robert West</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 18:06:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14562v1</guid></item><item><title>Visibility-Aware Keypoint Localization for 6DoF Object Pose Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14559v1</link><description>Localizing predefined 3D keypoints in a 2D image is an effective way toestablish 3D-2D correspondences for 6DoF object pose estimation.

Yet,current methods still face issues with scalability, limited flexibility, and aone-size-fits-all approach to control strength, not accounting for thediffering levels of conditional entropy, a measure of unpredictability in datagiven some condition, across modalities. To address these challenges, weintroduce a novel uni-modal training approach with modal surrogates, coupledwith an entropy-aware modal-adaptive modulation, to support flexible, scalable,and scalable multi-modal conditioned face synthesis network. Our uni-modaltraining with modal surrogate that only leverage uni-modal data, use modalsurrogate to decorate condition with modal-specific characteristic and serve aslinker for inter-modal collaboration , fully learns each modality control inface synthesis process as well as inter-modal collaboration. The entropy-awaremodal-adaptive modulation finely adjust diffusion noise according tomodal-specific characteristics and given conditions, enabling well-informedstep along denoising trajectory and ultimately leading to synthesis results ofhigh fidelity and quality. Our framework improves multi-modal face synthesisunder various conditions, surpassing current methods in image quality andfidelity, as demonstrated by our thorough experimental results.</description><author>Jingjing Ren, Cheng Xu, Haoyu Chen, Xinran Qin, Lei Zhu</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 17:58:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16274v2</guid></item><item><title>Gaussian Frosting: Editable Complex Radiance Fields with Real-Time Rendering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14554v1</link><description>We propose Gaussian Frosting, a novel mesh-based representation forhigh-quality rendering and editing of complex 3D effects in real-time.

However, it is not clear how a robot canapply such expressions, or in particular, how we can develop a strategy toadaptively use such expressions depending on the task and user in dynamicinteractions. To address this question, this paper proposes DynEmph, a methodfor a communication robot to decide where to emphasize XAI-generatedexplanations with physical expressions. It predicts the effect of emphasizingcertain points on a user and aims to minimize the expected difference betweenpredicted user decisions and AI-suggested ones. DynEmph features a strategy fordeciding where to emphasize in a data-driven manner, relieving engineers fromthe need to manually design a strategy. We further conducted experiments toinvestigate how emphasis selection strategies affect the performance of userdecisions.

These years, CNN-based and Transformer-based modelshave been widely used to classify various medical images. Unfortunately, Thelimitation of CNNs in long-range modeling capabilities prevents them fromeffectively extracting features in medical images, while Transformers arehampered by their quadratic computational complexity. Recent research has shownthat the state space model (SSM) represented by Mamba can efficiently modellong-range interactions while maintaining linear computational complexity.Inspired by this, we propose Vision Mamba for medical image classification(MedMamba). More specifically, we introduce a novel Conv-SSM module. Conv-SSMcombines the local feature extraction ability of convolutional layers with theability of SSM to capture long-range dependency, thereby modeling medicalimages with different modalities. To demonstrate the potential of MedMamba, weconducted extensive experiments using 14 publicly available medical datasetswith different imaging techniques and two private datasets built by ourselves.Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MedMamba performswell in detecting lesions in various medical images. To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first Vision Mamba tailored for medical imageclassification. The purpose of this work is to establish a new baseline formedical image classification tasks and provide valuable insights for the futuredevelopment of more efficient and effective SSM-based artificial intelligencealgorithms and application systems in the medical.

In particular,channel transformations (e.g., solarize, grayscale, brightness adjustments) areintegrated into data augmentation pipelines for remote sensing (RS) imageclassification tasks. However, contradicting beliefs exist about their properapplications to RS images. A common point of critique is that the applicationof channel augmentation techniques may lead to physically inconsistent spectraldata (i.e., pixel signatures). To shed light on the open debate, we propose anapproach to estimate whether a channel augmentation technique affects thephysical information of RS images. To this end, the proposed approach estimatesa score that measures the alignment of a pixel signature within a time seriesthat can be naturally subject to deviations caused by factors such asacquisition conditions or phenological states of vegetation. We compare thescores associated with original and augmented pixel signatures to evaluate thephysical consistency. Experimental results on a multi-label imageclassification task show that channel augmentations yielding a score thatexceeds the expected deviation of original pixel signatures can not improve theperformance of a baseline model trained without augmentation.</description><author>Tom Burgert, Beg√ºm Demir</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 17:48:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14547v1</guid></item><item><title>Intelligent Canvas: Enabling Design-Like Exploratory Visual Data Analysis with Generative AI through Rapid Prototyping, Iteration and Curation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08812v3</link><description>Complex data analysis inherently seeks unexpected insights throughexploratory visual analysis methods, transcending logical, step-by-stepprocessing.

We believe that producing DeepFakes that are highlyrealistic and 'detection evasive' can serve the ultimate goal of improvingfuture generation DeepFake detection capabilities. In this paper, we propose asimple yet powerful pipeline to reduce the artifact patterns of fake imageswithout hurting image quality by performing implicit spatial-domain notchfiltering. We first demonstrate that frequency-domain notch filtering, althoughfamously shown to be effective in removing periodic noise in the spatialdomain, is infeasible for our task at hand due to the manual designs requiredfor the notch filters. We, therefore, resort to a learning-based approach toreproduce the notch filtering effects, but solely in the spatial domain. Weadopt a combination of adding overwhelming spatial noise for breaking theperiodic noise pattern and deep image filtering to reconstruct the noise-freefake images, and we name our method DeepNotch. Deep image filtering provides aspecialized filter for each pixel in the noisy image, producing filtered imageswith high fidelity compared to their DeepFake counterparts. Moreover, we alsouse the semantic information of the image to generate an adversarial guidancemap to add noise intelligently.

Thus they are apromising avenue to accelerate large-scale linear computations. With thecurrent advances in micro-fabrication, such optical processors can now be 3Dfabricated, but with a limited precision. This limitation translates toquantization of learnable parameters in optical neurons, and should be handledduring the design of the optical processor in order to avoid a model mismatch.Specifically, optical neurons should be trained or designed within thephysical-constraints at a predefined quantized precision level. To address thiscritical issues we propose a physics-informed quantization-aware trainingframework. Our approach accounts for physical constraints during the trainingprocess, leading to robust designs. We demonstrate that our approach can designstate of the art optical processors using diffractive networks for multiplephysics based tasks despite quantized learnable parameters. We thus lay thefoundation upon which improved optical processors may be 3D fabricated in thefuture.</description><author>Hasindu Kariyawasam, Ramith Hettiarachchi, Quansan Yang, Alex Matlock, Takahiro Nambara, Hiroyuki Kusaka, Yuichiro Kunai, Peter T C So, Edward S Boyden, Dushan Wadduwage</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 17:21:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03049v2</guid></item><item><title>Collaborative Distributed Machine Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16584v3</link><description>Various collaborative distributed machine learning (CDML) systems, includingfederated learning systems and swarm learning systems, with different keytraits were developed to leverage resources for development and use of machinelearning (ML) models in a confidentiality-preserving way.

However, as the foundationmodel for many downstream tasks, current MLLMs are composed of the well-knownTransformer network, which has a less efficient quadratic computationcomplexity. To improve the efficiency of such basic models, we propose Cobra, alinear computational complexity MLLM. Specifically, Cobra integrates theefficient Mamba language model into the visual modality. Moreover, we exploreand study various modal fusion schemes to create an effective multi-modalMamba. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (1) Cobra achieves extremelycompetitive performance with current computationally efficient state-of-the-artmethods, \textit{e.g.}, LLaVA-Phi, TinyLLaVA, and MobileVLM v2, and has fasterspeed due to Cobra's linear sequential modeling. (2) Interestingly, the resultsof closed-set challenging prediction benchmarks show that Cobra performs wellin overcoming visual illusions and spatial relationship judgments. (3) Notably,Cobra even achieves comparable performance to LLaVA with about 43% of thenumber of parameters. We will make all codes of Cobra open-source and hope thatthe proposed method can facilitate future research on complexity problems inMLLM.

However, as a more practical scenario, aerial-groundperson re-identification (AGPReID) among heterogeneous cameras has receivedminimal attention. To alleviate the disruption of discriminative identityrepresentation by dramatic view discrepancy as the most significant challengein AGPReID, the view-decoupled transformer (VDT) is proposed as a simple yeteffective framework. Two major components are designed in VDT to decoupleview-related and view-unrelated features, namely hierarchical subtractiveseparation and orthogonal loss, where the former separates these two featuresinside the VDT, and the latter constrains these two to be independent. Inaddition, we contribute a large-scale AGPReID dataset called CARGO, consistingof five/eight aerial/ground cameras, 5,000 identities, and 108,563 images.Experiments on two datasets show that VDT is a feasible and effective solutionfor AGPReID, surpassing the previous method on mAP/Rank1 by up to 5.0%/2.7% onCARGO and 3.7%/5.2% on AG-ReID, keeping the same magnitude of computationalcomplexity.

Consequently, scholars have been activelyinvestigating efficacious self-supervised pre-training paradigms. Nevertheless,temporal information, which is inherent in the LiDAR point cloud sequence, isconsistently disregarded. To better utilize this property, we propose aneffective pre-training strategy, namely Temporal Masked Auto-Encoders (T-MAE),which takes as input temporally adjacent frames and learns temporal dependency.A SiamWCA backbone, containing a Siamese encoder and a windowed cross-attention(WCA) module, is established for the two-frame input. Considering that themovement of an ego-vehicle alters the view of the same instance, temporalmodeling also serves as a robust and natural data augmentation, enhancing thecomprehension of target objects. SiamWCA is a powerful architecture but heavilyrelies on annotated data. Our T-MAE pre-training strategy alleviates its demandfor annotated data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that T-MAE achievesthe best performance on both Waymo and ONCE datasets among competitiveself-supervised approaches.</description><author>Weijie Wei, Fatemeh Karimi Nejadasl, Theo Gevers, Martin R.

However, formany real-world problems, it is often more convenient to formulate optimizationproblems in terms of rewards and constraints simultaneously. Optimizing suchconstrained problems via reward shaping can be difficult as it requires tediousmanual tuning of reward functions with several interacting terms. Recentformulations which include constraints mostly require a pre-training phase,which often needs human expertise to collect data or assumes having asub-optimal policy readily available. We propose a new constrained RL methodcalled CSAC-LB (Constrained Soft Actor-Critic with Log Barrier Function), whichachieves competitive performance without any pre-training by applying a linearsmoothed log barrier function to an additional safety critic. It implements anadaptive penalty for policy learning and alleviates the numerical issues thatare known to complicate the application of the log barrier function method. Asa result, we show that with CSAC-LB, we achieve state-of-the-art performance onseveral constrained control tasks with different levels of difficulty andevaluate our methods in a locomotion task on a real quadruped robot platform.</description><author>Baohe Zhang, Yuan Zhang, Lilli Frison, Thomas Brox, Joschka B√∂decker</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 17:02:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14508v1</guid></item><item><title>TMI! Finetuned Models Leak Private Information from their Pretraining Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01181v2</link><description>Transfer learning has become an increasingly popular technique in machinelearning as a way to leverage a pretrained model trained for one task to assistwith building a finetuned model for a related task. This paradigm has beenespecially popular for $\textit{privacy}$ in machine learning, where thepretrained model is considered public, and only the data for finetuning isconsidered sensitive. However, there are reasons to believe that the data usedfor pretraining is still sensitive, making it essential to understand how muchinformation the finetuned model leaks about the pretraining data. In this workwe propose a new membership-inference threat model where the adversary only hasaccess to the finetuned model and would like to infer the membership of thepretraining data. To realize this threat model, we implement a novelmetaclassifier-based attack, $\textbf{TMI}$, that leverages the influence ofmemorized pretraining samples on predictions in the downstream task. Weevaluate $\textbf{TMI}$ on both vision and natural language tasks acrossmultiple transfer learning settings, including finetuning with differentialprivacy. Through our evaluation, we find that $\textbf{TMI}$ can successfullyinfer membership of pretraining examples using query access to the finetunedmodel. An open-source implementation of $\textbf{TMI}$ can be found$\href{https://github.com/johnmath/tmi-pets24}{\text{on GitHub}}$.</description><author>John Abascal, Stanley Wu, Alina Oprea, Jonathan Ullman</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:57:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01181v2</guid></item><item><title>Ins-HOI: Instance Aware Human-Object Interactions Recovery</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09641v2</link><description>Accurately modeling detailed interactions between human/hand and object is anappealing yet challenging task. Current multi-view capture systems are onlycapable of reconstructing multiple subjects into a single, unified mesh, whichfails to model the states of each instance individually during interactions. Toaddress this, previous methods use template-based representations to trackhuman/hand and object. However, the quality of the reconstructions is limitedby the descriptive capabilities of the templates so that these methods areinherently struggle with geometry details, pressing deformations and invisiblecontact surfaces. In this work, we propose an end-to-end Instance-awareHuman-Object Interactions recovery (Ins-HOI) framework by introducing aninstance-level occupancy field representation. However, the real-captured datais presented as a holistic mesh, unable to provide instance-level supervision.To address this, we further propose a complementary training strategy thatleverages synthetic data to introduce instance-level shape priors, enabling thedisentanglement of occupancy fields for different instances. Specifically,synthetic data, created by randomly combining individual scans of humans/handsand objects, guides the network to learn a coarse prior of instances.Meanwhile, real-captured data helps in learning the overall geometry andrestricting interpenetration in contact areas. As demonstrated in experiments,our method Ins-HOI supports instance-level reconstruction and providesreasonable and realistic invisible contact surfaces even in cases of extremelyclose interaction. To facilitate the research of this task, we collect alarge-scale, high-fidelity 3D scan dataset, including 5.2k high-quality scanswith real-world human-chair and hand-object interactions.

In this setting,cross-task distillation can be used, enabling the use of any teacher modeltrained on a different task. However, many KD methods prove ineffective whenapplied to this cross-task setting. To address this limitation, we propose asimple modification: the use of an inverted projection. We show that thisdrop-in replacement for a standard projector is effective by learning todisregard any task-specific features which might degrade the student'sperformance. We find that this simple modification is sufficient for extendingmany KD methods to the cross-task setting, where the teacher and student taskscan be very different. In doing so, we obtain up to a 1.9% improvement in thecross-task setting compared to the traditional projection, at no additionalcost. Our method can obtain significant performance improvements (up to 7%)when using even a randomly-initialised teacher on various tasks such as depthestimation, image translation, and semantic segmentation, despite the lack ofany learned knowledge to transfer. To provide conceptual and analyticalinsights into this result, we show that using an inverted projection allows thedistillation loss to be decomposed into a knowledge transfer and a spectralregularisation component. Through this analysis we are additionally able topropose a novel regularisation loss that allows teacher-free distillation,enabling performance improvements of up to 8.57% on ImageNet with no additionaltraining costs.</description><author>Dylan Auty, Roy Miles, Benedikt Kolbeinsson, Krystian Mikolajczyk</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:42:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14494v1</guid></item><item><title>Closing the Gap: Achieving Better Accuracy-Robustness Tradeoffs against Query-Based Attacks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10132v2</link><description>Although promising, existing defenses against query-based attacks share acommon limitation: they offer increased robustness against attacks at the priceof a considerable accuracy drop on clean samples.

We verify theeffectiveness of our approach for various existing defenses by conductingextensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Our results confirmthat our proposal can indeed enhance these defenses by providing bettertradeoffs between robustness and accuracy when compared to state-of-the-artapproaches while being completely training-free.</description><author>Pascal Zimmer, S√©bastien Andreina, Giorgia Azzurra Marson, Ghassan Karame</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:42:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10132v2</guid></item><item><title>Self-Supervised Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction with Spatial and Temporal Consistency Regularizations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13261v2</link><description>The perception of motion behavior in a dynamic environment holds significantimportance for autonomous driving systems, wherein class-agnostic motionprediction methods directly predict the motion of the entire point cloud. Whilemost existing methods rely on fully-supervised learning, the manual labeling ofpoint cloud data is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, severalannotation-efficient methods have been proposed to address this challenge.Although effective, these methods rely on weak annotations or additionalmulti-modal data like images, and the potential benefits inherent in the pointcloud sequence are still underexplored. To this end, we explore the feasibilityof self-supervised motion prediction with only unlabeled LiDAR point clouds.Initially, we employ an optimal transport solver to establish coarsecorrespondences between current and future point clouds as the coarse pseudomotion labels. Training models directly using such coarse labels leads tonoticeable spatial and temporal prediction inconsistencies. To mitigate theseissues, we introduce three simple spatial and temporal regularization losses,which facilitate the self-supervised training process effectively. Experimentalresults demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over thestate-of-the-art self-supervised methods.</description><author>Kewei Wang, Yizheng Wu, Jun Cen, Zhiyu Pan, Xingyi Li, Zhe Wang, Zhiguo Cao, Guosheng Lin</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:40:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13261v2</guid></item><item><title>Adversary-Robust Graph-Based Learning of WSIs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14489v1</link><description>Enhancing the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacksis crucial, especially in critical domains like healthcare where significantfinancial interests heighten the risk of such attacks. Whole slide images(WSIs) are high-resolution, digitized versions of tissue samples mounted onglass slides, scanned using sophisticated imaging equipment. The digitalanalysis of WSIs presents unique challenges due to their gigapixel size andmulti-resolution storage format. In this work, we aim at improving therobustness of cancer Gleason grading classification systems against adversarialattacks, addressing challenges at both the image and graph levels. As regardsthe proposed algorithm, we develop a novel and innovative graph-based modelwhich utilizes GNN to extract features from the graph representation of WSIs. Adenoising module, along with a pooling layer is incorporated to manage theimpact of adversarial attacks on the WSIs. The process concludes with atransformer module that classifies various grades of prostate cancer based onthe processed data. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, weconducted a comparative analysis using two scenarios. Initially, we trained andtested the model without the denoiser using WSIs that had not been exposed toany attack. We then introduced a range of attacks at either the image or graphlevel and processed them through the proposed network. The performance of themodel was evaluated in terms of accuracy and kappa scores. The results fromthis comparison showed a significant improvement in cancer diagnosis accuracy,highlighting the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method in handlingadversarial challenges in the context of medical imaging.</description><author>Saba Heidari Gheshlaghi, Milan Aryal, Nasim Yahyasoltani, Masoud Ganji</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:37:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14489v1</guid></item><item><title>Physics-Based Causal Reasoning for Safe &amp; Robust Next-Best Action Selection in Robot Manipulation Tasks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14488v1</link><description>Safe and efficient object manipulation is a key enabler of many real-worldrobot applications. However, this is challenging because robot operation mustbe robust to a range of sensor and actuator uncertainties. In this paper, wepresent a physics-informed causal-inference-based framework for a robot toprobabilistically reason about candidate actions in a block stacking task in apartially observable setting. We integrate a physics-based simulation of therigid-body system dynamics with a causal Bayesian network (CBN) formulation todefine a causal generative probabilistic model of the robot decision-makingprocess. Using simulation-based Monte Carlo experiments, we demonstrate ourframework's ability to successfully: (1) predict block tower stability withhigh accuracy (Pred Acc: 88.6%); and, (2) select an approximate next-bestaction for the block stacking task, for execution by an integrated robotsystem, achieving 94.2% task success rate. We also demonstrate our framework'ssuitability for real-world robot systems by demonstrating successful taskexecutions with a domestic support robot, with perception and manipulationsub-system integration. Hence, we show that by embedding physics-based causalreasoning into robots' decision-making processes, we can make robot taskexecution safer, more reliable, and more robust to various types ofuncertainty.</description><author>Ricardo Cannizzaro, Michael Groom, Jonathan Routley, Robert Osazuwa Ness, Lars Kunze</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:36:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14488v1</guid></item><item><title>DesignEdit: Multi-Layered Latent Decomposition and Fusion for Unified &amp; Accurate Image Editing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14487v1</link><description>Recently, how to achieve precise image editing has attracted increasingattention, especially given the remarkable success of text-to-image generationmodels. To unify various spatial-aware image editing abilities into oneframework, we adopt the concept of layers from the design domain to manipulateobjects flexibly with various operations. The key insight is to transform thespatial-aware image editing task into a combination of two sub-tasks:multi-layered latent decomposition and multi-layered latent fusion. First, wesegment the latent representations of the source images into multiple layers,which include several object layers and one incomplete background layer thatnecessitates reliable inpainting. To avoid extra tuning, we further explore theinner inpainting ability within the self-attention mechanism. We introduce akey-masking self-attention scheme that can propagate the surrounding contextinformation into the masked region while mitigating its impact on the regionsoutside the mask. Second, we propose an instruction-guided latent fusion thatpastes the multi-layered latent representations onto a canvas latent. We alsointroduce an artifact suppression scheme in the latent space to enhance theinpainting quality. Due to the inherent modular advantages of suchmulti-layered representations, we can achieve accurate image editing, and wedemonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses the latest spatial editingmethods, including Self-Guidance and DiffEditor. Last, we show that ourapproach is a unified framework that supports various accurate image editingtasks on more than six different editing tasks.</description><author>Yueru Jia, Yuhui Yuan, Aosong Cheng, Chuke Wang, Ji Li, Huizhu Jia, Shanghang Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:35:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14487v1</guid></item><item><title>EasyInstruct: An Easy-to-use Instruction Processing Framework for Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03049v3</link><description>In recent years, instruction tuning has gained increasing attention andemerged as a crucial technique to enhance the capabilities of Large LanguageModels (LLMs).

To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new reconstructionframework based on neural radiance field (NeRF), named ColonNeRF, whichleverages neural rendering for novel view synthesis of long-sequencecolonoscopy. Specifically, to reconstruct the entire colon in a piecewisemanner, our ColonNeRF introduces a region division and integration module,effectively reducing shape dissimilarity and ensuring geometric consistency ineach segment. To learn both the simple and complex geometry in a unifiedframework, our ColonNeRF incorporates a multi-level fusion module thatprogressively models the colon regions from easy to hard. Additionally, toovercome the challenges from sparse views, we devise a DensiNet module fordensifying camera poses under the guidance of semantic consistency. We conductextensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate ourColonNeRF. Quantitatively, ColonNeRF exhibits a 67%-85% increase in LPIPS-ALEXscores. Qualitatively, our reconstruction visualizations show much clearertextures and more accurate geometric details.

While most prior studies focused onreconstructing 3D hand shapes, some recent work has tackled the reconstructionof hand textures on top of shapes. However, these methods are often limited tocapturing pixels on the visible side of a hand, requiring diverse views of thehand in a video or multiple images as input. In this paper, we propose a novelmethod, BiTT(Bi-directional Texture reconstruction of Two hands), which is thefirst end-to-end trainable method for relightable, pose-free texturereconstruction of two interacting hands taking only a single RGB image, bythree novel components: 1) bi-directional (left $\leftrightarrow$ right)texture reconstruction using the texture symmetry of left / right hands, 2)utilizing a texture parametric model for hand texture recovery, and 3) theoverall coarse-to-fine stage pipeline for reconstructing personalized textureof two interacting hands. BiTT first estimates the scene light condition andalbedo image from an input image, then reconstructs the texture of both handsthrough the texture parametric model and bi-directional texture reconstructor.In experiments using InterHand2.6M and RGB2Hands datasets, our methodsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art hand texture reconstruction methodsquantitatively and qualitatively.

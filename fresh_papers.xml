The reconstructed avatarscan be animated and relit in real time with the global illumination of diverseenvironments. Unlike existing approaches that estimate parametric reflectanceparameters via inverse rendering, our approach directly models learnableradiance transfer that incorporates global light transport in an efficientmanner for real-time rendering. However, learning such a complex lighttransport that can generalize across identities is non-trivial. A phone scan ina single environment lacks sufficient information to infer how the head wouldappear in general environments. To address this, we build a universalrelightable avatar model represented by 3D Gaussians. We train on hundreds ofhigh-quality multi-view human scans with controllable point lights.High-resolution geometric guidance further enhances the reconstruction accuracyand generalization. Once trained, we finetune the pretrained model on a phonescan using inverse rendering to obtain a personalized relightable avatar. Ourexperiments establish the efficacy of our design, outperforming existingapproaches while retaining real-time rendering capability.</description><author>Junxuan Li, Chen Cao, Gabriel Schwartz, Rawal Khirodkar, Christian Richardt, Tomas Simon, Yaser Sheikh, Shunsuke Saito</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:59:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24223v1</guid></item><item><title>Robust Gaussian Processes via Relevance Pursuit</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24222v1</link><description>Gaussian processes (GPs) are non-parametric probabilistic regression modelsthat are popular due to their flexibility, data efficiency, and well-calibrateduncertainty estimates. However, standard GP models assume homoskedasticGaussian noise, while many real-world applications are subject to non-Gaussiancorruptions. Variants of GPs that are more robust to alternative noise modelshave been proposed, and entail significant trade-offs between accuracy androbustness, and between computational requirements and theoretical guarantees.In this work, we propose and study a GP model that achieves robustness againstsparse outliers by inferring data-point-specific noise levels with a sequentialselection procedure maximizing the log marginal likelihood that we refer to asrelevance pursuit. We show, surprisingly, that the model can be parameterizedsuch that the associated log marginal likelihood is strongly concave in thedata-point-specific noise variances, a property rarely found in either robustregression objectives or GP marginal likelihoods. This in turn implies the weaksubmodularity of the corresponding subset selection problem, and thereby provesapproximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm. We compare the model'sperformance relative to other approaches on diverse regression and Bayesianoptimization tasks, including the challenging but common setting of sparsecorruptions of the labels within or close to the function range.</description><author>Sebastian Ament, Elizabeth Santorella, David Eriksson, Ben Letham, Maximilian Balandat, Eytan Bakshy</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:59:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24222v1</guid></item><item><title>EgoMimic: Scaling Imitation Learning via Egocentric Video</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24221v1</link><description>The scale and diversity of demonstration data required for imitation learningis a significant challenge. We present EgoMimic, a full-stack framework whichscales manipulation via human embodiment data, specifically egocentric humanvideos paired with 3D hand tracking. EgoMimic achieves this through: (1) asystem to capture human embodiment data using the ergonomic Project Ariaglasses, (2) a low-cost bimanual manipulator that minimizes the kinematic gapto human data, (3) cross-domain data alignment techniques, and (4) an imitationlearning architecture that co-trains on human and robot data. Compared to priorworks that only extract high-level intent from human videos, our approachtreats human and robot data equally as embodied demonstration data and learns aunified policy from both data sources. EgoMimic achieves significantimprovement on a diverse set of long-horizon, single-arm and bimanualmanipulation tasks over state-of-the-art imitation learning methods and enablesgeneralization to entirely new scenes. Finally, we show a favorable scalingtrend for EgoMimic, where adding 1 hour of additional hand data issignificantly more valuable than 1 hour of additional robot data.

Current models often yield static orminimally dynamic outputs, failing to capture complex motions described bytext. This issue stems from the internal biases in text encoding, whichoverlooks motions, and inadequate conditioning mechanisms in T2V generationmodels. To address this, we propose a novel framework called DEcomposed MOtion(DEMO), which enhances motion synthesis in T2V generation by decomposing bothtext encoding and conditioning into content and motion components. Our methodincludes a content encoder for static elements and a motion encoder fortemporal dynamics, alongside separate content and motion conditioningmechanisms. Crucially, we introduce text-motion and video-motion supervision toimprove the model's understanding and generation of motion. Evaluations onbenchmarks such as MSR-VTT, UCF-101, WebVid-10M, EvalCrafter, and VBenchdemonstrate DEMO's superior ability to produce videos with enhanced motiondynamics while maintaining high visual quality. Our approach significantlyadvances T2V generation by integrating comprehensive motion understandingdirectly from textual descriptions.

Traditional experimental and computational methods facechallenges in terms of environmental constraints and computational demands,while current deep learning approaches still fall short in terms of precisionand generality. In this work, we introduce the Geometric Diffusion Bridge(GDB), a novel generative modeling framework that accurately bridges initialand target geometric states. GDB leverages a probabilistic approach to evolvegeometric state distributions, employing an equivariant diffusion bridgederived by a modified version of Doob's $h$-transform for connecting geometricstates. This tailored diffusion process is anchored by initial and targetgeometric states as fixed endpoints and governed by equivariant transitionkernels. Moreover, trajectory data can be seamlessly leveraged in our GDBframework by using a chain of equivariant diffusion bridges, providing a moredetailed and accurate characterization of evolution dynamics. Theoretically, weconduct a thorough examination to confirm our framework's ability to preservejoint distributions of geometric states and capability to completely model theunderlying dynamics inducing trajectory distributions with negligible error.Experimental evaluations across various real-world scenarios show that GDBsurpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, opening up a new pathway foraccurately bridging geometric states and tackling crucial scientific challengeswith improved accuracy and applicability.</description><author>Shengjie Luo, Yixian Xu, Di He, Shuxin Zheng, Tie-Yan Liu, Liwei Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:59:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24220v1</guid></item><item><title>Teaching Embodied Reinforcement Learning Agents: Informativeness and Diversity of Language Use</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24218v1</link><description>In real-world scenarios, it is desirable for embodied agents to have theability to leverage human language to gain explicit or implicit knowledge forlearning tasks. Despite recent progress, most previous approaches adopt simplelow-level instructions as language inputs, which may not reflect natural humancommunication. It's not clear how to incorporate rich language use tofacilitate task learning. To address this question, this paper studiesdifferent types of language inputs in facilitating reinforcement learning (RL)embodied agents. More specifically, we examine how different levels of languageinformativeness (i.e., feedback on past behaviors and future guidance) anddiversity (i.e., variation of language expressions) impact agent learning andinference. Our empirical results based on four RL benchmarks demonstrate thatagents trained with diverse and informative language feedback can achieveenhanced generalization and fast adaptation to new tasks. These findingshighlight the pivotal role of language use in teaching embodied agents newtasks in an open world.

Traditional optimizers, includingAdam, apply uniform or globally adjusted learning rates across neural networkswithout considering their architectural specifics. This architecture-agnosticapproach is deeply embedded in most deep learning frameworks, where optimizersare implemented as standalone modules without direct access to the network'sstructural information. For instance, in popular frameworks like Keras orPyTorch, optimizers operate solely on gradients and parameters, withoutknowledge of layer connectivity or network topology. Our algorithm, CaAdam,explores this overlooked area by introducing connection-aware optimizationthrough carefully designed proxies of architectural information. We proposemultiple scaling methodologies that dynamically adjust learning rates based oneasily accessible structural properties such as layer depth, connection counts,and gradient distributions. This approach enables more granular optimizationwhile working within the constraints of current deep learning frameworks.Empirical evaluations on standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST) showthat our method consistently achieves faster convergence and higher accuracycompared to standard Adam optimizer, demonstrating the potential benefits ofincorporating architectural awareness in optimization strategies.</description><author>Remi Genet, Hugo Inzirillo</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:59:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24216v1</guid></item><item><title>ARQ: A Mixed-Precision Quantization Framework for Accurate and Certifiably Robust DNNs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24214v1</link><description>Mixed precision quantization has become an important technique for enablingthe execution of deep neural networks (DNNs) on limited resource computingplatforms. Traditional quantization methods have primarily concentrated onmaintaining neural network accuracy, either ignoring the impact of quantizationon the robustness of the network, or using only empirical techniques forimproving robustness. In contrast, techniques for robustness certification,which can provide strong guarantees about the robustness of DNNs have not beenused during quantization due to their high computation cost. This paper introduces ARQ, an innovative mixed-precision quantization methodthat not only preserves the clean accuracy of the smoothed classifiers but alsomaintains their certified robustness. ARQ uses reinforcement learning to findaccurate and robust DNN quantization, while efficiently leveraging randomizedsmoothing, a popular class of statistical DNN verification algorithms, to guidethe search process. We compare ARQ with multiple state-of-the-art quantization techniques onseveral DNN architectures commonly used in quantization studies: ResNet-20 onCIFAR-10, ResNet-50 on ImageNet, and MobileNetV2 on ImageNet. We demonstratethat ARQ consistently performs better than these baselines across all thebenchmarks and the input perturbation levels. In many cases, the performance ofARQ quantized networks can reach that of the original DNN with floating-pointweights, but with only 1.5% instructions.</description><author>Yuchen Yang, Shubham Ugare, Yifan Zhao, Gagandeep Singh, Sasa Misailovic</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:59:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24214v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning Video Representations without Natural Videos</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24213v1</link><description>In this paper, we show that useful video representations can be learned fromsynthetic videos and natural images, without incorporating natural videos inthe training. We propose a progression of video datasets synthesized by simplegenerative processes, that model a growing set of natural video properties(e.g. motion, acceleration, and shape transformations). The downstreamperformance of video models pre-trained on these generated datasets graduallyincreases with the dataset progression. A VideoMAE model pre-trained on oursynthetic videos closes 97.2% of the performance gap on UCF101 actionclassification between training from scratch and self-supervised pre-trainingfrom natural videos, and outperforms the pre-trained model on HMDB51.Introducing crops of static images to the pre-training stage results in similarperformance to UCF101 pre-training and outperforms the UCF101 pre-trained modelon 11 out of 14 out-of-distribution datasets of UCF101-P. Analyzing thelow-level properties of the datasets, we identify correlations between framediversity, frame similarity to natural data, and downstream performance. Ourapproach provides a more controllable and transparent alternative to video datacuration processes for pre-training.</description><author>Xueyang Yu, Xinlei Chen, Yossi Gandelsman</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:59:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24213v1</guid></item><item><title>DELTA: Dense Efficient Long-range 3D Tracking for any video</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24211v1</link><description>Tracking dense 3D motion from monocular videos remains challenging,particularly when aiming for pixel-level precision over long sequences. Weintroduce \Approach, a novel method that efficiently tracks every pixel in 3Dspace, enabling accurate motion estimation across entire videos. Our approachleverages a joint global-local attention mechanism for reduced-resolutiontracking, followed by a transformer-based upsampler to achieve high-resolutionpredictions. Unlike existing methods, which are limited by computationalinefficiency or sparse tracking, \Approach delivers dense 3D tracking at scale,running over 8x faster than previous methods while achieving state-of-the-artaccuracy. Furthermore, we explore the impact of depth representation ontracking performance and identify log-depth as the optimal choice. Extensiveexperiments demonstrate the superiority of \Approach on multiple benchmarks,achieving new state-of-the-art results in both 2D and 3D dense tracking tasks.Our method provides a robust solution for applications requiring fine-grained,long-term motion tracking in 3D space.</description><author>Tuan Duc Ngo, Peiye Zhuang, Chuang Gan, Evangelos Kalogerakis, Sergey Tulyakov, Hsin-Ying Lee, Chaoyang Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:59:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24211v1</guid></item><item><title>TabM: Advancing Tabular Deep Learning with Parameter-Efficient Ensembling</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24210v1</link><description>Deep learning architectures for supervised learning on tabular data rangefrom simple multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to sophisticated Transformers andretrieval-augmented methods. This study highlights a major, yet so faroverlooked opportunity for substantially improving tabular MLPs: namely,parameter-efficient ensembling -- a paradigm for implementing an ensemble ofmodels as one model producing multiple predictions. We start by developing TabM-- a simple model based on MLP and our variations of BatchEnsemble (an existingtechnique). Then, we perform a large-scale evaluation of tabular DLarchitectures on public benchmarks in terms of both task performance andefficiency, which renders the landscape of tabular DL in a new light.Generally, we show that MLPs, including TabM, form a line of stronger and morepractical models compared to attention- and retrieval-based architectures. Inparticular, we find that TabM demonstrates the best performance among tabularDL models. Lastly, we conduct an empirical analysis on the ensemble-like natureof TabM. For example, we observe that the multiple predictions of TabM are weakindividually, but powerful collectively. Overall, our work brings an impactfultechnique to tabular DL, analyses its behaviour, and advances theperformance-efficiency trade-off with TabM -- a simple and powerful baselinefor researchers and practitioners.</description><author>Yury Gorishniy, Akim Kotelnikov, Artem Babenko</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:58:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24210v1</guid></item><item><title>NAVSIM: Data-Driven Non-Reactive Autonomous Vehicle Simulation and Benchmarking</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15349v2</link><description>Benchmarking vision-based driving policies is challenging. On one hand,open-loop evaluation with real data is easy, but these results do not reflectclosed-loop performance. On the other, closed-loop evaluation is possible insimulation, but is hard to scale due to its significant computational demands.Further, the simulators available today exhibit a large domain gap to realdata. This has resulted in an inability to draw clear conclusions from therapidly growing body of research on end-to-end autonomous driving. In thispaper, we present NAVSIM, a middle ground between these evaluation paradigms,where we use large datasets in combination with a non-reactive simulator toenable large-scale real-world benchmarking. Specifically, we gathersimulation-based metrics, such as progress and time to collision, by unrollingbird's eye view abstractions of the test scenes for a short simulation horizon.Our simulation is non-reactive, i.e., the evaluated policy and environment donot influence each other. As we demonstrate empirically, this decoupling allowsopen-loop metric computation while being better aligned with closed-loopevaluations than traditional displacement errors. NAVSIM enabled a newcompetition held at CVPR 2024, where 143 teams submitted 463 entries, resultingin several new insights. On a large set of challenging scenarios, we observethat simple methods with moderate compute requirements such as TransFuser canmatch recent large-scale end-to-end driving architectures such as UniAD. Ourmodular framework can potentially be extended with new datasets, data curationstrategies, and metrics, and will be continually maintained to host futurechallenges.

Our model, trained exclusively with photometric loss, achievesreal-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction during inference. To eliminate the needfor accurate pose input during reconstruction, we anchor one input view's localcamera coordinates as the canonical space and train the network to predictGaussian primitives for all views within this space. This approach obviates theneed to transform Gaussian primitives from local coordinates into a globalcoordinate system, thus avoiding errors associated with per-frame Gaussians andpose estimation. To resolve scale ambiguity, we design and compare variousintrinsic embedding methods, ultimately opting to convert camera intrinsicsinto a token embedding and concatenate it with image tokens as input to themodel, enabling accurate scene scale prediction. We utilize the reconstructed3D Gaussians for novel view synthesis and pose estimation tasks and propose atwo-stage coarse-to-fine pipeline for accurate pose estimation. Experimentalresults demonstrate that our pose-free approach can achieve superior novel viewsynthesis quality compared to pose-required methods, particularly in scenarioswith limited input image overlap. For pose estimation, our method, trainedwithout ground truth depth or explicit matching loss, significantly outperformsthe state-of-the-art methods with substantial improvements. This work makessignificant advances in pose-free generalizable 3D reconstruction anddemonstrates its applicability to real-world scenarios.

A key difficulty is thatmuch of an optimizer's behavior is implicitly determined by complex oscillatorydynamics, referred to as the "edge of stability." The main contribution of thispaper is to show that an optimizer's implicit behavior can be explicitlycaptured by a "central flow:" a differential equation which models thetime-averaged optimization trajectory. We show that these flows can empiricallypredict long-term optimization trajectories of generic neural networks with ahigh degree of numerical accuracy. By interpreting these flows, we reveal forthe first time 1) the precise sense in which RMSProp adapts to the local losslandscape, and 2) an "acceleration via regularization" mechanism, whereinadaptive optimizers implicitly navigate towards low-curvature regions in whichthey can take larger steps. This mechanism is key to the efficacy of theseadaptive optimizers. Overall, we believe that central flows constitute apromising tool for reasoning about optimization in deep learning.</description><author>Jeremy M.

Toaddress these issues, we introduce a novel path-planning algorithm, ZonalRL-RRT, that leverages kd-tree partitioning to segment the map into zones whileaddressing zone connectivity, ensuring seamless transitions between zones. Bybreaking down the complex environment into multiple zones and using Q-learningas the high-level decision-maker, our algorithm achieves a 3x improvement intime efficiency compared to basic sampling methods such as RRT and RRT* inforest-like maps. Our approach outperforms heuristic-guided methods like BIT*and Informed RRT* by 1.5x in terms of runtime while maintaining robust andreliable success rates across 2D to 6D environments. Compared to learning-basedmethods like NeuralRRT* and MPNetSMP, as well as the heuristic RRT*J, ouralgorithm demonstrates, on average, 1.5x better performance in the sameenvironments. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our approach throughsimulations of the UR10e arm manipulator in the MuJoCo environment.

While recent 3DGS methods haveachieved remarkable results in novel view synthesis (NVS), accurately capturinghigh-fidelity geometry, physically interpretable materials and lighting remainschallenging, as it requires precise geometry modeling to provide accuratesurface normals, along with physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques toensure correct material and lighting disentanglement. Previous 3DGS methodsresort to approximating surface normals, but often struggle with noisy localgeometry, leading to inaccurate normal estimation and suboptimalmaterial-lighting decomposition. In this paper, we introduce GeoSplatting, anovel hybrid representation that augments 3DGS with explicit geometric guidanceand differentiable PBR equations. Specifically, we bridge isosurface and 3DGStogether, where we first extract isosurface mesh from a scalar field, thenconvert it into 3DGS points and formulate PBR equations for them in a fullydifferentiable manner. In GeoSplatting, 3DGS is grounded on the mesh geometry,enabling precise surface normal modeling, which facilitates the use of PBRframeworks for material decomposition. This approach further maintains theefficiency and quality of NVS from 3DGS while ensuring accurate geometry fromthe isosurface. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets demonstratethe superiority of GeoSplatting, consistently outperforming existing methodsboth quantitatively and qualitatively.</description><author>Kai Ye, Chong Gao, Guanbin Li, Wenzheng Chen, Baoquan Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:57:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24204v1</guid></item><item><title>DiffPano: Scalable and Consistent Text to Panorama Generation with Spherical Epipolar-Aware Diffusion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24203v1</link><description>Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable achievements in 2D image or3D object generation, however, the generation of 3D scenes and even$360^{\circ}$ images remains constrained, due to the limited number of scenedatasets, the complexity of 3D scenes themselves, and the difficulty ofgenerating consistent multi-view images. To address these issues, we firstestablish a large-scale panoramic video-text dataset containing millions ofconsecutive panoramic keyframes with corresponding panoramic depths, cameraposes, and text descriptions. Then, we propose a novel text-driven panoramicgeneration framework, termed DiffPano, to achieve scalable, consistent, anddiverse panoramic scene generation. Specifically, benefiting from the powerfulgenerative capabilities of stable diffusion, we fine-tune a single-viewtext-to-panorama diffusion model with LoRA on the established panoramicvideo-text dataset. We further design a spherical epipolar-aware multi-viewdiffusion model to ensure the multi-view consistency of the generated panoramicimages.

Thisinnovative approach enables the model to develop robust representations andadapt its attribute control capabilities across a variable number ofattributes, from a single attribute to multiple complex configurations. TheP-MASKING technique enhances LingGen's ability to manage different levels ofattribute visibility, resulting in superior performance in multi-attributegeneration tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that LingGen surpasses currentstate-of-the-art models in both attribute control accuracy and text fluency,particularly excelling in scenarios with varying attribute demands.Additionally, our ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of P-MASKING andthe influence of different base language models on performance.

In this paper, we find that the performancedegradation is due to a phenomenon called Length Collapse, where longer textembeddings collapse into a narrow space. This collapse results in adistributional inconsistency between embeddings of different text lengths,ultimately hurting the performance of downstream tasks. Theoretically, byconsidering the self-attention mechanism inherently functions as a low-passfilter, we prove that long sequences increase the attenuation rate of thelow-pass filter effect of the self-attention mechanism. With layers goingdeeper, excessive low-pass filtering causes the token signals to retain onlytheir Direct-Current (DC) component, which means the input token feature mapswill collapse into a narrow space, especially in long texts. Based on the aboveanalysis, we propose to mitigate the undesirable length collapse limitation byintroducing a temperature in softmax(), which achieves a higher low-filterattenuation rate. The tuning-free method, called TempScale, can be plugged intomultiple transformer-based embedding models. Empirically, we demonstrate thatTempScale can improve existing embedding models, especially on long textinputs, bringing up to 0.53% performance gains on 40 datasets from Massive TextEmbedding Benchmark (MTEB) and 0.82% performance gains on 4 datasets fromLongEmbed, which specifically focuses on long context retrieval.</description><author>Yuqi Zhou, Sunhao Dai, Zhanshuo Cao, Xiao Zhang, Jun Xu</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:55:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24200v1</guid></item><item><title>Multi-Attribute Linguistic Tuning for Controlled Paraphrase Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24199v1</link><description>We present a novel approach to paraphrase generation that enables precisecontrol and fine-tuning of 40 linguistic attributes for English.

We propose SelfCodeAlign, the first fully transparent andpermissive pipeline for self-aligning code LLMs without extensive humanannotations or distillation. SelfCodeAlign employs the same base model forinference throughout the data generation process. It first extracts diversecoding concepts from high-quality seed snippets to generate new tasks. It thensamples multiple responses per task, pairs each with test cases, and validatesthem in a sandbox environment. Finally, passing examples are selected forinstruction tuning. In our primary experiments, we use SelfCodeAlign withCodeQwen1.5-7B to generate a dataset of 74k instruction-response pairs.Finetuning on this dataset leads to a model that achieves a 67.1 pass@1 onHumanEval+, surpassing CodeLlama-70B-Instruct despite being ten times smaller.Across all benchmarks, this finetuned model consistently outperforms theoriginal version trained with OctoPack, the previous state-of-the-art methodfor instruction tuning without human annotations or distillation. Additionally,we show that SelfCodeAlign is effective across LLMs of various sizes, from 3Bto 33B, and that the base models can benefit more from alignment with their owndata distribution. We further validate each component's effectiveness in ourpipeline, showing that SelfCodeAlign outperforms both direct distillation fromGPT-4o and leading GPT-3.5-based distillation methods, such as OSS-Instruct andEvol-Instruct. SelfCodeAlign has also led to the creation ofStarCoder2-Instruct, the first fully transparent, permissively licensed, andself-aligned code LLM that achieves state-of-the-art coding performance.</description><author>Yuxiang Wei, Federico Cassano, Jiawei Liu, Yifeng Ding, Naman Jain, Zachary Mueller, Harm de Vries, Leandro von Werra, Arjun Guha, Lingming Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:55:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24198v1</guid></item><item><title>Hidden Persuaders: LLMs' Political Leaning and Their Influence on Voters</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24190v1</link><description>How could LLMs influence our democracy? We investigate LLMs' politicalleanings and the potential influence of LLMs on voters by conducting multipleexperiments in a U.S. presidential election context. Through a votingsimulation, we first demonstrate 18 open- and closed-weight LLMs' politicalpreference for a Democratic nominee over a Republican nominee. We show how thisleaning towards the Democratic nominee becomes more pronounced ininstruction-tuned models compared to their base versions by analyzing theirresponses to candidate-policy related questions. We further explore thepotential impact of LLMs on voter choice by conducting an experiment with 935U.S. registered voters. During the experiments, participants interacted withLLMs (Claude-3, Llama-3, and GPT-4) over five exchanges. The experiment resultsshow a shift in voter choices towards the Democratic nominee following LLMinteraction, widening the voting margin from 0.7% to 4.6%, even though LLMswere not asked to persuade users to support the Democratic nominee during thediscourse. This effect is larger than many previous studies on thepersuasiveness of political campaigns, which have shown minimal effects inpresidential elections. Many users also expressed a desire for furtherpolitical interaction with LLMs. Which aspects of LLM interactions drove theseshifts in voter choice requires further study.

Meanwhile,researchers also proposed extremely compact, under-parameterized image priors(e.g., deep decoder) that are strikingly competent for image restoration too,despite a loss of accuracy. These two extremes push us to think whether thereexists a better solution in the middle: between over- and under-parameterizedimage priors, can one identify "intermediate" parameterized image priors thatachieve better trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and even preservingstrong transferability? Drawing inspirations from the lottery ticket hypothesis(LTH), we conjecture and study a novel "lottery image prior" (LIP) byexploiting DNN inherent sparsity, stated as: given an over-parameterizedDNN-based image prior, it will contain a sparse subnetwork that can be trainedin isolation, to match the original DNN's performance when being applied as aprior to various image inverse problems. Our results validate the superiorityof LIPs: we can successfully locate the LIP subnetworks from over-parameterizedDIPs at substantial sparsity ranges. Those LIP subnetworks significantlyoutperform deep decoders under comparably compact model sizes (by often fullypreserving the effectiveness of their over-parameterized counterparts), andthey also possess high transferability across different images as well asrestoration task types. Besides, we also extend LIP to compressive sensingimage reconstruction, where a pre-trained GAN generator is used as the prior(in contrast to untrained DIP or deep decoder), and confirm its validity inthis setting too. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that LTH isdemonstrated to be relevant in the context of inverse problems or image priors.</description><author>Qiming Wu, Xiaohan Chen, Yifan Jiang, Zhangyang Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:49:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24187v1</guid></item><item><title>DexMimicGen: Automated Data Generation for Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation via Imitation Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24185v1</link><description>Imitation learning from human demonstrations is an effective means to teachrobots manipulation skills. But data acquisition is a major bottleneck inapplying this paradigm more broadly, due to the amount of cost and human effortinvolved. There has been significant interest in imitation learning forbimanual dexterous robots, like humanoids. Unfortunately, data collection iseven more challenging here due to the challenges of simultaneously controllingmultiple arms and multi-fingered hands. Automated data generation in simulationis a compelling, scalable alternative to fuel this need for data. To this end,we introduce DexMimicGen, a large-scale automated data generation system thatsynthesizes trajectories from a handful of human demonstrations for humanoidrobots with dexterous hands. We present a collection of simulation environmentsin the setting of bimanual dexterous manipulation, spanning a range ofmanipulation behaviors and different requirements for coordination among thetwo arms. We generate 21K demos across these tasks from just 60 source humandemos and study the effect of several data generation and policy learningdecisions on agent performance.

Nevertheless, deploying neuralnetwork-based CGH algorithms on computationally limited embedded systemsrequires more efficient models with lower computational cost, memory footprint,and power consumption. In this study, we developed a lightweight model forcomplex hologram generation by introducing neural network quantization.Specifically, we built a model based on tensor holography and quantized it from32-bit floating-point precision (FP32) to 8-bit integer precision (INT8). Ourperformance evaluation shows that the proposed INT8 model achieves hologramquality comparable to that of the FP32 model while reducing the model size byapproximately 70% and increasing the speed fourfold.

While fine-tuning T2I models withreward objectives has shown promise, it suffers from "reward hacking" and maynot generalize well to unseen prompt distributions. In this work, we proposeReward-based Noise Optimization (ReNO), a novel approach that enhances T2Imodels at inference by optimizing the initial noise based on the signal fromone or multiple human preference reward models. Remarkably, solving thisoptimization problem with gradient ascent for 50 iterations yields impressiveresults on four different one-step models across two competitive benchmarks,T2I-CompBench and GenEval. Within a computational budget of 20-50 seconds,ReNO-enhanced one-step models consistently surpass the performance of allcurrent open-source Text-to-Image models. Extensive user studies demonstratethat our model is preferred nearly twice as often compared to the popular SDXLmodel and is on par with the proprietary Stable Diffusion 3 with 8B parameters.Moreover, given the same computational resources, a ReNO-optimized one-stepmodel outperforms widely-used open-source models such as SDXL andPixArt-$\alpha$, highlighting the efficiency and effectiveness of ReNO inenhancing T2I model performance at inference time.

The proposed attackmethod first adds random noise to an image to destroy the watermark and thenreconstructs the image. This approach is flexible and can be instantiated withmany existing image-denoising algorithms and pre-trained generative models suchas diffusion models. Through formal proofs and extensive empirical evaluations,we demonstrate that pixel-level invisible watermarks are vulnerable to thisregeneration attack. Our results reveal that, across four different pixel-levelwatermarking schemes, the proposed method consistently achieves superiorperformance compared to existing attack techniques, with lower detection ratesand higher image quality. However, watermarks that keep the image semanticallysimilar can be an alternative defense against our attacks.

Unlike state of the art models,linear splines allow to represent extended objects whose contour is anarbitrarily complex curve. An exact likelihood is derived for the case in whichnoisy measurements can be scattered from any point on the contour of theextended object, while an approximate Monte Carlo likelihood is provided forthe case wherein scattering points can be anywhere, i.e. inside or on thecontour, on the object surface. Exploiting such likelihood to measure how wellthe observed data fit a given shape, a suitable estimator is developed. Theproposed estimator models the extended object in terms of a kinematic state,providing object position and orientation, along with a shape vector,characterizing object contour and surface. The kinematic state is estimated viaa nonlinear Kalman filter, while the shape vector is estimated via a Bayesianclassifier so that classification is implicitly solved during shape estimation.Numerical experiments are provided to assess, compared to state of the artextended object estimators, the effectiveness of the proposed one.</description><author>Matteo Tesori, Giorgio Battistelli, Luigi Chisci</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:46:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24183v1</guid></item><item><title>Federated Black-Box Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24181v1</link><description>Federated Learning (FL) is a form of distributed learning that allowsmultiple institutions or clients to collaboratively learn a global model tosolve a task.

Although some large-scale pretrained vision encoders such as visionencoders in CLIP and DINOv2 have brought promising performance, we found thatthere is still no single vision encoder that can dominate various image contentunderstanding, e.g., the CLIP vision encoder leads to outstanding results ongeneral image understanding but poor performance on document or chart content.To alleviate the bias of CLIP vision encoder, we first delve into the inherentbehavior of different pre-trained vision encoders and then propose the MoVA, apowerful and novel MLLM, adaptively routing and fusing task-specific visionexperts with a coarse-to-fine mechanism.

It involves how a model's performance changes withincreases in model size or input data, as well as how efficiently computationalresources are utilized to support this growth. Despite successes in otherareas, the study of scaling in Neural Network Interatomic Potentials (NNIPs)remains limited. NNIPs act as surrogate models for ab initio quantum mechanicalcalculations. The dominant paradigm here is to incorporate many physical domainconstraints into the model, such as rotational equivariance. We contend thatthese complex constraints inhibit the scaling ability of NNIPs, and are likelyto lead to performance plateaus in the long run. In this work, we take analternative approach and start by systematically studying NNIP scalingstrategies. Our findings indicate that scaling the model through attentionmechanisms is efficient and improves model expressivity. These insightsmotivate us to develop an NNIP architecture designed for scalability: theEfficiently Scaled Attention Interatomic Potential (EScAIP). EScAIP leverages amulti-head self-attention formulation within graph neural networks, applyingattention at the neighbor-level representations. Implemented withhighly-optimized attention GPU kernels, EScAIP achieves substantial gains inefficiency--at least 10x faster inference, 5x less memory usage--compared toexisting NNIPs. EScAIP also achieves state-of-the-art performance on a widerange of datasets including catalysts (OC20 and OC22), molecules (SPICE), andmaterials (MPTrj). We emphasize that our approach should be thought of as aphilosophy rather than a specific model, representing a proof-of-concept fordeveloping general-purpose NNIPs that achieve better expressivity throughscaling, and continue to scale efficiently with increased computationalresources and training data.</description><author>Eric Qu, Aditi S.

This restriction,parameterized by a window size and dilation factor, draws a spectrum ofpossible attention patterns between linear projection and self attention.Neighborhood attention, and more generally sliding window attention patterns,have long been bounded by infrastructure, particularly in higher-rank spaces(2-D and 3-D), calling for the development of custom kernels, which have beenlimited in either functionality, or performance, if not both. In this work, weaim to massively improve upon existing infrastructure by providing two newmethods for implementing neighborhood attention. We first show thatneighborhood attention can be represented as a batched GEMM problem, similar tostandard attention, and implement it for 1-D and 2-D neighborhood attention.These kernels on average provide 895% and 272% improvement in full precisionruntime compared to existing naive CUDA kernels for 1-D and 2-D neighborhoodattention respectively. We find that aside from being heavily bound by memorybandwidth, certain inherent inefficiencies exist in all unfused implementationsof neighborhood attention, which in most cases undo their theoreticalefficiency gain. Motivated by the progress made into fused dot-productattention kernels, we developed fused neighborhood attention; an adaptation offused dot-product attention kernels that allow fine-grained control overattention across different spatial axes.

In thispaper, we discuss how generalist robot policies (i.e., robot foundation models)can address these challenges, and how we can design effective generalist robotpolicies for complex and highly dexterous tasks. We propose a novel flowmatching architecture built on top of a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM)to inherit Internet-scale semantic knowledge. We then discuss how this modelcan be trained on a large and diverse dataset from multiple dexterous robotplatforms, including single-arm robots, dual-arm robots, and mobilemanipulators. We evaluate our model in terms of its ability to perform tasks inzero shot after pre-training, follow language instructions from people and froma high-level VLM policy, and its ability to acquire new skills via fine-tuning.Our results cover a wide variety of tasks, such as laundry folding, tablecleaning, and assembling boxes.</description><author>Kevin Black, Noah Brown, Danny Driess, Adnan Esmail, Michael Equi, Chelsea Finn, Niccolo Fusai, Lachy Groom, Karol Hausman, Brian Ichter, Szymon Jakubczak, Tim Jones, Liyiming Ke, Sergey Levine, Adrian Li-Bell, Mohith Mothukuri, Suraj Nair, Karl Pertsch, Lucy Xiaoyang Shi, James Tanner, Quan Vuong, Anna Walling, Haohuan Wang, Ury Zhilinsky</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:22:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24164v1</guid></item><item><title>Models Can and Should Embrace the Communicative Nature of Human-Generated Math</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17005v2</link><description>Math is constructed by people for people: just as natural language corporareflect not just propositions but the communicative goals of language users,the math data that models are trained on reflects not just idealizedmathematical entities but rich communicative intentions. While there areimportant advantages to treating math in a purely symbolic manner, we herehypothesize that there are benefits to treating math as situated linguisticcommunication and that language models are well suited for this goal, in waysthat are not fully appreciated. We illustrate these points with two casestudies. First, we ran an experiment in which we found that language modelsinterpret the equals sign in a humanlike way -- generating systematicallydifferent word problems for the same underlying equation arranged in differentways. Second, we found that language models prefer proofs to be ordered innaturalistic ways, even though other orders would be logically equivalent.

We begin by introducing theQuantile Attention-Fourier Deep Operator Network (QAF-DeepONet), designed tocapture the complex dynamics of voltage trajectories and reliably estimatequantiles of the target trajectory without any distributional assumptions. Theproposed operator regression model maps the observed portion of the voltagetrajectory to its unobserved post-fault trajectory. Our methodology employs apre-training and fine-tuning process to address the challenge of limited dataavailability. To ensure data privacy in learning the pre-trained model, we usemerging via federated learning with data from neighboring buses, enabling themodel to learn the underlying voltage dynamics from such buses without directlysharing their data. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model with data fromthe target bus, allowing it to adapt to unique dynamics and operatingconditions. Finally, we integrate conformal prediction into the fine-tunedmodel to ensure coverage guarantees for the predicted intervals. We evaluatedthe performance of the proposed methodology using the New England 39-bus testsystem considering detailed models of voltage and frequency controllers. Twometrics, Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and PredictionInterval Normalized Average Width (PINAW), are used to numerically assess themodel's performance in predicting intervals. The results show that the proposedapproach offers practical and reliable uncertainty quantification in predictingthe interval of post-fault voltage trajectories.</description><author>Amirhossein Mollaali, Gabriel Zufferey, Gonzalo Constante-Flores, Christian Moya, Can Li, Guang Lin, Meng Yue</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:20:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24162v1</guid></item><item><title>Redefining &lt;Creative&gt; in Dictionary: Towards a Enhanced Semantic Understanding of Creative Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24160v1</link><description>Creativity, both in human and diffusion models, remains an inherentlyabstract concept; thus, simply adding "creative" to a prompt does not yieldreliable semantic recognition by the model. In this work, we concretize theabstract notion of "creative" through the TP2O task, which aims to merge twounrelated concepts, and introduce CreTok, redefining "creative" as the token$\texttt{&lt;CreTok&gt;}$. This redefinition offers a more concrete and universallyadaptable representation for concept blending. This redefinition occurscontinuously, involving the repeated random sampling of text pairs withdifferent concepts and optimizing cosine similarity between target and constantprompts. This approach enables $\texttt{&lt;CreTok&gt;}$ to learn a method forcreative concept fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the creativecapability enabled by $\texttt{&lt;CreTok&gt;}$ substantially surpasses recent SOTAdiffusion models and achieves superior creative generation. CreTok exhibitsgreater flexibility and reduced time overhead, as $\texttt{&lt;CreTok&gt;}$ canfunction as a universal token for any concept, facilitating creative generationwithout retraining.</description><author>Fu Feng, Yucheng Xie, Jing Wang, Xin Geng</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:19:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24160v1</guid></item><item><title>TSI-Bench: Benchmarking Time Series Imputation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12747v2</link><description>Effective imputation is a crucial preprocessing step for time seriesanalysis.

Moreover, although many deep learning forecasting algorithms havedemonstrated excellent performance, whether their modelling achievements can betransferred to time series imputation tasks remains unexplored. To bridge thesegaps, we develop TSI-Bench, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensivebenchmark suite for time series imputation utilizing deep learning techniques.The TSI-Bench pipeline standardizes experimental settings to enable fairevaluation of imputation algorithms and identification of meaningful insightsinto the influence of domain-appropriate missing rates and patterns on modelperformance. Furthermore, TSI-Bench innovatively provides a systematic paradigmto tailor time series forecasting algorithms for imputation purposes.

While GlobalNavigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are the standard default solution forsolving the aerial localization problem, it is subject to a number oflimitations, such as, signal instability or solution unreliability that makethis option not so desirable. Consequently, visual geolocalization is emergingas a viable alternative.

However, existing methods often remain confined topreviously explored solution spaces and thus overlook the critical blind spotwithin LLMs' cognitive range. To address these issues, we design the ThoughtSpace Explorer (TSE), a novel framework to expand and optimize thoughtstructures to guide LLMs to explore their blind spots of thinking. Bygenerating new reasoning steps and branches based on the original thoughtstructure with various designed strategies, TSE broadens the thought space andalleviates the impact of blind spots for LLM reasoning. Experimental results onmultiple levels of reasoning tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TSE. We alsoconduct extensive analysis to understand how structured and expansive thoughtcan contribute to unleashing the potential of LLM reasoning capabilities.</description><author>Jinghan Zhang, Fengran Mo, Xiting Wang, Kunpeng Liu</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:12:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24155v1</guid></item><item><title>Dense Associative Memory Through the Lens of Random Features</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24153v1</link><description>Dense Associative Memories are high storage capacity variants of the Hopfieldnetworks that are capable of storing a large number of memory patterns in theweights of the network of a given size.

Traditional approaches have employed CNNs and various other deeplearning techniques, trained on extensive collections of labeled images. Whilethese methods demonstrated effective performance, there remains potential forfurther enhancements. In this paper, we propose to utilize vision languagemodels (VLMs) such as generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), GEMINI, largelanguage and vision assistant (LLAVA), PaliGemma, and Microsoft Florence2 torecognize facial attributes such as race, gender, age, and emotion from imageswith human faces. Various datasets like FairFace, AffectNet, and UTKFace havebeen utilized to evaluate the solutions. The results show that VLMs arecompetitive if not superior to traditional techniques. Additionally, we propose"FaceScanPaliGemma"--a fine-tuned PaliGemma model--for race, gender, age, andemotion recognition. The results show an accuracy of 81.1%, 95.8%, 80%, and59.4% for race, gender, age group, and emotion classification, respectively,outperforming pre-trained version of PaliGemma, other VLMs, and SotA methods.Finally, we propose "FaceScanGPT", which is a GPT-4o model to recognize theabove attributes when several individuals are present in the image using aprompt engineered for a person with specific facial and/or physical attributes.The results underscore the superior multitasking capability of FaceScanGPT todetect the individual's attributes like hair cut, clothing color, postures,etc., using only a prompt to drive the detection and recognition tasks.</description><author>Nouar AlDahoul, Myles Joshua Toledo Tan, Harishwar Reddy Kasireddy, Yasir Zaki</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 17:09:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24148v1</guid></item><item><title>Do they mean 'us'?

In this paper, we model the intergroup bias as a taggingtask on English sports comments from forums dedicated to fandom for NFL teams.We curate a unique dataset of over 6 million game-time comments from opposingperspectives (the teams in the game), each comment grounded in a non-linguisticdescription of the events that precipitated these comments (live winprobabilities for each team). Expert and crowd annotations justify modeling thebias through tagging of implicit and explicit referring expressions and revealthe rich, contextual understanding of language and the world required for thistask. For large-scale analysis of intergroup variation, we use LLMs forautomated tagging, and discover that some LLMs perform best when prompted withlinguistic descriptions of the win probability at the time of the comment,rather than numerical probability. Further, large-scale tagging of commentsusing LLMs uncovers linear variations in the form of referent across winprobabilities that distinguish in-group and out-group utterances.

However, many state-of-the-art causal discovery methodsdo not output single causal graphs, but rather their Markov equivalence classes(MECs) which encode all of the graph's separation and connection statements. Inthis work, we propose additional measures of distance that capture thedifference in separations of two causal graphs which link-based distances arenot fit to assess. The proposed distances have low polynomial time complexityand are applicable to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as well as to maximalancestral graph (MAGs) that may contain bidirected edges. We complement ourtheoretical analysis with toy examples and empirical experiments that highlightthe differences to existing comparison metrics.</description><author>Jonas Wahl, Jakob Runge</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:55:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04952v3</guid></item><item><title>Synthetic Programming Elicitation for Text-to-Code in Very Low-Resource Programming and Formal Languages</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03636v4</link><description>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for code applications havedemonstrated remarkable zero-shot fluency and instruction following onchallenging code related tasks ranging from test case generation toself-repair. Unsurprisingly, however, models struggle to compose syntacticallyvalid programs in programming languages unrepresented in pre-training, referredto as very low-resource Programming Languages (VLPLs). VLPLs appear in crucialsettings, including domain-specific languages for internal tools, tool-chainsfor legacy languages, and formal verification frameworks. Inspired by atechnique called natural programming elicitation, we propose designing anintermediate language that LLMs "naturally" know how to use and which can beautomatically compiled to a target VLPL. When LLMs generate code that liesoutside of this intermediate language, we use compiler techniques to repair thecode into programs in the intermediate language. Overall, we introduce\emph{synthetic programming elicitation and compilation} (SPEAC), an approachthat enables LLMs to generate syntactically valid code even for VLPLs. Weempirically evaluate the performance of SPEAC in a case study for the UCLID5formal verification language and find that, compared to existing retrieval andfine-tuning baselines, SPEAC produces syntactically correct programs morefrequently and without sacrificing semantic correctness.</description><author>Federico Mora, Justin Wong, Haley Lepe, Sahil Bhatia, Karim Elmaaroufi, George Varghese, Joseph E.

It has attractedgrowing attention in recent years, where existing approaches focus onself-training that usually includes pseudo-labeling techniques. In this paper,we introduce a novel noise-learning approach tailored to address noisedistribution in domain adaptation settings and learn to de-confuse thepseudo-labels. More specifically, we learn a noise transition matrix of thepseudo-labels to capture the label corruption of each class and learn theunderlying true label distribution. Estimating the noise transition matrixenables a better true class-posterior estimation, resulting in betterprediction accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach whencombined with several source-free domain adaptation methods: SHOT, SHOT++, andAaD. We obtain state-of-the-art results on three domain adaptation datasets:VisDA, DomainNet, and OfficeHome.</description><author>Idit Diamant, Amir Rosenfeld, Idan Achituve, Jacob Goldberger, Arnon Netzer</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:53:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01650v3</guid></item><item><title>Q-learning for Quantile MDPs: A Decomposition, Performance, and Convergence Analysis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24128v1</link><description>In Markov decision processes (MDPs), quantile risk measures such asValue-at-Risk are a standard metric for modeling RL agents' preferences forcertain outcomes.

In many text datasets, we also observe per-documentcovariates (e.g., source, style, political affiliation) that act asenvironments that modulate a "global" (environment-agnostic) topicrepresentation. Accurately learning these representations is important forprediction on new documents in unseen environments and for estimating thecausal effect of topics on real-world outcomes. To this end, we introduce theMulti-environment Topic Model (MTM), an unsupervised probabilistic model thatseparates global and environment-specific terms. Through experimentation onvarious political content, from ads to tweets and speeches, we show that theMTM produces interpretable global topics with distinct environment-specificwords. On multi-environment data, the MTM outperforms strong baselines in andout-of-distribution.

However, supporting novel goals or behaviors throughreinforcement learning requires the ad-hoc design of appropriate rewardfunctions, which quickly becomes intractable. To address this challenge, wepropose Text-Aware Diffusion for Policy Learning (TADPoLe), which uses apretrained, frozen text-conditioned diffusion model to compute dense zero-shotreward signals for text-aligned policy learning. We hypothesize thatlarge-scale pretrained generative models encode rich priors that can supervisea policy to behave not only in a text-aligned manner, but also in alignmentwith a notion of naturalness summarized from internet-scale training data. Inour experiments, we demonstrate that TADPoLe is able to learn policies fornovel goal-achievement and continuous locomotion behaviors specified by naturallanguage, in both Humanoid and Dog environments. The behaviors are learnedzero-shot without ground-truth rewards or expert demonstrations, and arequalitatively more natural according to human evaluation.

However, because the output of GenAI cannot be guaranteed to becorrect, manual intervention remains necessary. Some of this intervention canbe automated through task-specific tools, alongside additional methodologiesfor correctness verification and effective prompt development. We explored theapplication of GenAI in assisting with code translation, languageinteroperability, and codebase inspection within a legacy Fortran codebase usedto simulate particle interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In theprocess, we developed a tool, CodeScribe, which combines prompt engineeringwith user supervision to establish an efficient process for code conversion. Inthis paper, we demonstrate how CodeScribe assists in converting Fortran code toC++, generating Fortran-C APIs for integrating legacy systems with modern C++libraries, and providing developer support for code organization and algorithmimplementation.

However, in many practical scenarios, the goal isto identify the best model using the fewest generated samples to minimize thecosts of querying data from the models. Such an online comparison ischallenging with current offline assessment methods. In this work, we proposean online evaluation framework to find the generative model that maximizes astandard assessment score among a group of available models. Our method uses anoptimism-based multi-armed bandit framework to identify the model producingdata with the highest evaluation score, quantifying the quality and diversityof generated data. Specifically, we study the online assessment of generativemodels based on the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS)metrics and propose the FID-UCB and IS-UCB algorithms leveraging the upperconfidence bound approach in online learning. We prove sub-linear regret boundsfor these algorithms and present numerical results on standard image datasets,demonstrating their effectiveness in identifying the score-maximizinggenerative model.</description><author>Xiaoyan Hu, Ho-fung Leung, Farzan Farnia</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:48:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07451v2</guid></item><item><title>Repository-Level Compositional Code Translation and Validation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24117v1</link><description>Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) toanother. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate codetranslation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can becomeobsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studieshave explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models(LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for craftedbenchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-worldprojects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-levelcode translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employsmultiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves thefunctionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs,AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragmentsand translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans totranslate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of &lt;836, 8575, 2719&gt;classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans translated the entire repository ofthese projects consisting of 6899 source code fragments. 99.1% of thetranslated code fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validatesthe translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 25.8%. Onaverage, the integrated translation and validation take 36 hours to translate aproject, showing its scalability in practice. For the syntactically orsemantically incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report includingexisting translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. Weprovided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in fourprojects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieveall passing tests.</description><author>Ali Reza Ibrahimzada, Kaiyao Ke, Mrigank Pawagi, Muhammad Salman Abid, Rangeet Pan, Saurabh Sinha, Reyhaneh Jabbarvand</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:46:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24117v1</guid></item><item><title>AIDOVECL: AI-generated Dataset of Outpainted Vehicles for Eye-level Classification and Localization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24116v1</link><description>Image labeling is a critical bottleneck in the development of computer visiontechnologies, often constraining the potential of machine learning models dueto the time-intensive nature of manual annotations. This work introduces anovel approach that leverages outpainting to address the problem of annotateddata scarcity by generating artificial contexts and annotations, significantlyreducing manual labeling efforts. We apply this technique to a particularlyacute challenge in autonomous driving, urban planning, and environmentalmonitoring: the lack of diverse, eye-level vehicle images in desired classes.Our dataset comprises AI-generated vehicle images obtained by detecting andcropping vehicles from manually selected seed images, which are then outpaintedonto larger canvases to simulate varied real-world conditions. The outpaintedimages include detailed annotations, providing high-quality ground truth data.Advanced outpainting techniques and image quality assessments ensure visualfidelity and contextual relevance. Augmentation with outpainted vehiclesimproves overall performance metrics by up to 8\% and enhances prediction ofunderrepresented classes by up to 20\%.

To achieve this, we extend the originalVenn-Abers procedure from binary classification to regression. Our theoreticalframework supports analyzing conformal prediction methods that involvecalibrating model predictions and subsequently constructing conditionally validprediction intervals on the same data, where the conditioning set or conformityscores may depend on the calibrated predictions.

While improvements have been made to overcome initialshortcomings, online finetuning of decision transformers has been surprisinglyunder-explored. The widely adopted state-of-the-art Online Decision Transformer(ODT) still struggles when pretrained with low-reward offline data. In thispaper, we theoretically analyze the online-finetuning of the decisiontransformer, showing that the commonly used Return-To-Go (RTG) that's far fromthe expected return hampers the online fine-tuning process. This problem,however, is well-addressed by the value function and advantage of standard RLalgorithms. As suggested by our analysis, in our experiments, we hence findthat simply adding TD3 gradients to the finetuning process of ODT effectivelyimproves the online finetuning performance of ODT, especially if ODT ispretrained with low-reward offline data. These findings provide new directionsto further improve decision transformers.</description><author>Kai Yan, Alexander G.

However, theultimate performance of SiD is constrained by the accuracy with which thepretrained model captures the true data scores at different stages of thediffusion process. In this paper, we introduce SiDA (SiD with AdversarialLoss), which not only enhances generation quality but also improvesdistillation efficiency by incorporating real images and adversarial loss. SiDAutilizes the encoder from the generator's score network as a discriminator,boosting its ability to distinguish between real images and those generated bySiD. The adversarial loss is batch-normalized within each GPU and then combinedwith the original SiD loss. This integration effectively incorporates theaverage "fakeness" per GPU batch into the pixel-based SiD loss, enabling SiDAto distill a single-step generator either from scratch or by fine-tuning anexisting one. SiDA converges significantly faster than its predecessor whentrained from scratch, and swiftly improves upon the original model'sperformance after an initial warmup period during fine-tuning from apre-distilled SiD generator. This one-step adversarial distillation methodestablishes new benchmarks in generation performance when distilling EDMdiffusion models pretrained on CIFAR-10 (32x32) and ImageNet (64x64), achievingFID score of 1.110 on ImageNet 64x64.

We seek topartition a given set $P$ of data points into $k$ clusters by finding a set $X$of $k$ centers and assigning each data point to one of the centers. The cost ofa cluster, represented by a center $x\in X$, is a monotone, symmetric norm $f$(inner norm) of the vector of distances of points assigned to $x$. The goal isto minimize a norm $g$ (outer norm) of the vector of cluster costs. Thisproblem, which we call $(f,g)$-Clustering, generalizes many fundamentalclustering problems such as $k$-Center, $k$-Median , Min-Sum of Radii, andMin-Load $k$-Clustering .

However, commonly used IQAmeasures have been primarily developed and optimized for natural images. Inmany specialized settings, such as medical images, this poses anoften-overlooked problem regarding suitability. In previous studies, the IQAmeasure HaarPSI showed promising behavior for natural and medical images.HaarPSI is based on Haar wavelet representations and the framework allowsoptimization of two parameters. So far, these parameters have been aligned fornatural images. Here, we optimize these parameters for two annotated medicaldata sets, a photoacoustic and a chest X-Ray data set. We observe that they aremore sensitive to the parameter choices than the employed natural images, andon the other hand both medical data sets lead to similar parameter values whenoptimized. We denote the optimized setting, which improves the performance forthe medical images notably, by HaarPSI$_{MED}$. The results suggest thatadapting common IQA measures within their frameworks for medical images canprovide a valuable, generalizable addition to the employment of more specifictask-based measures.</description><author>Clemens Karner, Janek Gröhl, Ian Selby, Judith Babar, Jake Beckford, Thomas R Else, Timothy J Sadler, Shahab Shahipasand, Arthikkaa Thavakumar, Michael Roberts, James H.

Our framework is inspired by how parents safeguardtheir children across a progression of increasingly riskier tasks, imparting asense of safety that is carried over from task to task. We model this as ameta-learning process where each task is synchronized with a safeguard thatmonitors safety and provides a reward signal to the agent. The safeguard isimplemented as a finite-state machine based on a safety specification; thereward signal is formally shaped around this specification. The safetyspecification and its corresponding safeguard can be arbitrarily complex andnon-Markovian, which adds flexibility to the training process andexplainability to the learned policy. The design of the safeguard is manual butit is high-level and model-agnostic, which gives rise to an end-to-end safelearning approach with wide applicability, from pixel-level game control tolanguage model fine-tuning. Starting from a given set of safety specifications(tasks), we train a model such that it can adapt to new specifications usingonly a small number of training samples. This is made possible by our methodfor efficiently transferring safety bias between tasks, which effectivelyminimizes the number of safety violations. We evaluate our framework in aMinecraft-inspired Gridworld, a VizDoom game environment, and an LLMfine-tuning application. Agents trained with our approach achieve near-minimalsafety violations, while baselines are shown to underperform.</description><author>Nabil Omi, Hosein Hasanbeig, Hiteshi Sharma, Sriram K.

Developing similarmulti-modal sensing capabilities for robots can significantly enhance andexpand their manipulation skills. This paper introduces \textbf{3D-ViTac}, amulti-modal sensing and learning system designed for dexterous bimanualmanipulation. Our system features tactile sensors equipped with dense sensingunits, each covering an area of 3$mm^2$. These sensors are low-cost andflexible, providing detailed and extensive coverage of physical contacts,effectively complementing visual information. To integrate tactile and visualdata, we fuse them into a unified 3D representation space that preserves their3D structures and spatial relationships. The multi-modal representation canthen be coupled with diffusion policies for imitation learning. Throughconcrete hardware experiments, we demonstrate that even low-cost robots canperform precise manipulations and significantly outperform vision-onlypolicies, particularly in safe interactions with fragile items and executinglong-horizon tasks involving in-hand manipulation.

Hence, $d$ can still scale with $S$ depending on thedirect reachability of the environment. To address this limitation of linearMDPs, we propose a novel structural aggregation framework based on dynamics,named as the "dynamics aggregation". For this newly proposed framework, wedesign a provably efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm inlinear function approximation that leverages aggregated sub-structures. Ourproposed algorithm exhibits statistical efficiency, achieving a regret of $\tilde{O} ( d_{\psi}^{3/2} H^{3/2}\sqrt{ N T} )$, where $d_{\psi}$ representsthe feature dimension of aggregated subMDPs and $N$ signifies the number ofaggregated subMDPs. We establish that the condition $d_{\psi}^3 N \ll d^{3}$ isreadily met in most real-world environments with hierarchical structures,enabling a substantial improvement in the regret bound compared to LSVI-UCB,which enjoys a regret of $ \tilde{O} (d^{3/2} H^{3/2} \sqrt{ T})$. To the bestof our knowledge, this work presents the first HRL algorithm with linearfunction approximation that offers provable guarantees.</description><author>Joongkyu Lee, Min-hwan Oh</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:21:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24089v1</guid></item><item><title>EraW-Net: Enhance-Refine-Align W-Net for Scene-Associated Driver Attention Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08570v2</link><description>Associating driver attention with driving scene across two fields of views(FOVs) is a hard cross-domain perception problem, which requires comprehensiveconsideration of cross-view mapping, dynamic driving scene analysis, and driverstatus tracking. Previous methods typically focus on a single view or mapattention to the scene via estimated gaze, failing to exploit the implicitconnection between them. Moreover, simple fusion modules are insufficient formodeling the complex relationships between the two views, making informationintegration challenging. To address these issues, we propose a novel method forend-to-end scene-associated driver attention estimation, called EraW-Net. Thismethod enhances the most discriminative dynamic cues, refines featurerepresentations, and facilitates semantically aligned cross-domain integrationthrough a W-shaped architecture, termed W-Net. Specifically, a Dynamic AdaptiveFilter Module (DAF-Module) is proposed to address the challenges of frequentlychanging driving environments by extracting vital regions. It suppresses theindiscriminately recorded dynamics and highlights crucial ones by innovativejoint frequency-spatial analysis, enhancing the model's ability to parsecomplex dynamics. Additionally, to track driver states during non-fixed facialposes, we propose a Global Context Sharing Module (GCS-Module) to constructrefined feature representations by capturing hierarchical features that adaptto various scales of head and eye movements. Finally, W-Net achieves systematiccross-view information integration through its "Encoding-Independent PartialDecoding-Fusion Decoding" structure, addressing semantic misalignment inheterogeneous data integration. Experiments demonstrate that the proposedmethod robustly and accurately estimates the mapping of driver attention inscene on large public datasets.</description><author>Jun Zhou, Chunsheng Liu, Faliang Chang, Wenqian Wang, Penghui Hao, Yiming Huang, Zhiqiang Yang</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:20:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08570v2</guid></item><item><title>In-Context Fine-Tuning for Time-Series Foundation Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24087v1</link><description>Motivated by the recent success of time-series foundation models forzero-shot forecasting, we present a methodology for $\textit{in-contextfine-tuning}$ of a time-series foundation model. In particular, we design apretrained foundation model that can be prompted (at inference time) withmultiple time-series examples, in order to forecast a target time-series intothe future. Our foundation model is specifically trained to utilize examplesfrom multiple related time-series in its context window (in addition to thehistory of the target time-series) to help it adapt to the specificdistribution of the target domain at inference time. We show that such afoundation model that uses in-context examples at inference time can obtainmuch better performance on popular forecasting benchmarks compared tosupervised deep learning methods, statistical models, as well as othertime-series foundation models. Interestingly, our in-context fine-tuningapproach even rivals the performance of a foundation model that is explicitlyfine-tuned on the target domain.</description><author>Abhimanyu Das, Matthew Faw, Rajat Sen, Yichen Zhou</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:20:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24087v1</guid></item><item><title>An Efficient Dynamic Resource Allocation Framework for Evolutionary Bilevel Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24081v1</link><description>Bilevel optimization problems are characterized by an interactivehierarchical structure, where the upper level seeks to optimize its strategywhile simultaneously considering the response of the lower level. Evolutionaryalgorithms are commonly used to solve complex bilevel problems in practicalscenarios, but they face significant resource consumption challenges due to thenested structure imposed by the implicit lower-level optimality condition. Thischallenge becomes even more pronounced as problem dimensions increase. Althoughrecent methods have enhanced bilevel convergence through task-level knowledgesharing, further efficiency improvements are still hindered by redundantlower-level iterations that consume excessive resources while generatingunpromising solutions. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes anefficient dynamic resource allocation framework for evolutionary bileveloptimization, named DRC-BLEA. Compared to existing approaches, DRC-BLEAintroduces a novel competitive quasi-parallel paradigm, in which multiplelower-level optimization tasks, derived from different upper-level individuals,compete for resources. A continuously updated selection probability is used toprioritize execution opportunities to promising tasks. Additionally, acooperation mechanism is integrated within the competitive framework to furtherenhance efficiency and prevent premature convergence. Experimental resultscompared with chosen state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectivenessof the proposed method. Specifically, DRC-BLEA achieves competitive accuracyacross diverse problem sets and real-world scenarios, while significantlyreducing the number of function evaluations and overall running time.</description><author>Dejun Xu, Kai Ye, Zimo Zheng, Tao Zhou, Gary G.

A common approach is to write the model in a probabilistic programminglanguage and then sample via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). However, there aremany ways a user can transform a model that make inference more or lessefficient. In particular, marginalizing some variables can greatly improveinference but is difficult for users to do manually. We develop an algorithm toeasily marginalize random effects in LMMs. A naive approach introduces cubictime operations within an inference algorithm like HMC, but we reduce therunning time to linear using fast linear algebra techniques. We show thatmarginalization is always beneficial when applicable and highlight improvementsin various models, especially ones from cognitive sciences.</description><author>Jinlin Lai, Daniel Sheldon, Justin Domke</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:16:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24079v1</guid></item><item><title>Efficient Federated Learning against Heterogeneous and Non-stationary Client Unavailability</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17446v2</link><description>Addressing intermittent client availability is critical for the real-worlddeployment of federated learning algorithms. Most prior work either overlooksthe potential non-stationarity in the dynamics of client unavailability orrequires substantial memory/computation overhead. We study federated learningin the presence of heterogeneous and non-stationary client availability, whichmay occur when the deployment environments are uncertain, or the clients aremobile. The impacts of heterogeneity and non-stationarity on clientunavailability can be significant, as we illustrate using FedAvg, the mostwidely adopted federated learning algorithm. We propose FedAPM, which includesnovel algorithmic structures that (i) compensate for missed computations due tounavailability with only $O(1)$ additional memory and computation with respectto standard FedAvg, and (ii) evenly diffuse local updates within the federatedlearning system through implicit gossiping, despite being agnostic tonon-stationary dynamics. We show that FedAPM converges to a stationary point ofeven non-convex objectives while achieving the desired linear speedup property.We corroborate our analysis with numerical experiments over diversified clientunavailability dynamics on real-world data sets.</description><author>Ming Xiang, Stratis Ioannidis, Edmund Yeh, Carlee Joe-Wong, Lili Su</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:16:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17446v2</guid></item><item><title>Identifying Spatio-Temporal Drivers of Extreme Events</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24075v1</link><description>The spatio-temporal relations of impacts of extreme events and their driversin climate data are not fully understood and there is a need of machinelearning approaches to identify such spatio-temporal relations from data. Thetask, however, is very challenging since there are time delays between extremesand their drivers, and the spatial response of such drivers is inhomogeneous.In this work, we propose a first approach and benchmarks to tackle thischallenge. Our approach is trained end-to-end to predict spatio-temporallyextremes and spatio-temporally drivers in the physical input variables jointly.By enforcing the network to predict extremes from spatio-temporal binary masksof identified drivers, the network successfully identifies drivers that arecorrelated with extremes. We evaluate our approach on three newly createdsynthetic benchmarks, where two of them are based on remote sensing orreanalysis climate data, and on two real-world reanalysis datasets.

However, there is alack of systematic and standardized benchmarks to promote the development ofLLMs in task automation. To address this, we introduce TaskBench, acomprehensive framework to evaluate the capability of LLMs in task automation.Specifically, task automation can be divided into three critical stages: taskdecomposition, tool selection, and parameter prediction. To tackle thecomplexities inherent in these stages, we introduce the concept of Tool Graphto represent decomposed tasks and adopt a back-instruct method to generatehigh-quality user instructions. We propose TaskEval, a multi-faceted evaluationmethodology that assesses LLM performance across these three stages. Ourapproach combines automated construction with rigorous human verification,ensuring high consistency with human evaluation. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that TaskBench effectively reflects the capabilities of variousLLMs in task automation. It provides insights into model performance acrossdifferent task complexities and domains, pushing the boundaries of what currentmodels can achieve. TaskBench offers a scalable, adaptable, and reliablebenchmark for advancing LLM-based autonomous agents.</description><author>Yongliang Shen, Kaitao Song, Xu Tan, Wenqi Zhang, Kan Ren, Siyu Yuan, Weiming Lu, Dongsheng Li, Yueting Zhuang</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:12:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18760v3</guid></item><item><title>Univariate Conditional Variational Autoencoder for Morphogenic Patterns Design in Frontal Polymerization-Based Manufacturing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17518v2</link><description>Under some initial and boundary conditions, the rapid reaction-thermaldiffusion process taking place during frontal polymerization (FP) destabilizesthe planar mode of front propagation, leading to spatially varying, complexhierarchical patterns in thermoset polymeric materials. Although modernreaction-diffusion models can predict the patterns resulting from unstable FP,the inverse design of patterns, which aims to retrieve process conditions thatproduce a desired pattern, remains an open challenge due to the non-unique andnon-intuitive mapping between process conditions and manufactured patterns. Inthis work, we propose a probabilistic generative model named univariateconditional variational autoencoder (UcVAE) for the inverse design ofhierarchical patterns in FP-based manufacturing. Unlike the cVAE, which encodesboth the design space and the design target, the UcVAE encodes only the designspace. In the encoder of the UcVAE, the number of training parameters issignificantly reduced compared to the cVAE, resulting in a shorter trainingtime while maintaining comparable performance. Given desired pattern images,the trained UcVAE can generate multiple process condition solutions thatproduce high-fidelity hierarchical patterns.</description><author>Qibang Liu, Pengfei Cai, Diab Abueidda, Sagar Vyas, Seid Koric, Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli, Philippe Geubelle</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:10:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17518v2</guid></item><item><title>LaCour!: Enabling Research on Argumentation in Hearings of the European Court of Human Rights</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05061v3</link><description>Why does an argument end up in the final court decision?

Existing solutions either work under very specificassumptions or achieve bounds that are vacuous in some regimes. Furthermore,many structural assumptions are known to suffer from a provably unavoidableexponential dependence on the time horizon $H$ in the regret, which makes anypossible solution unfeasible in practice. In this paper, we identify locallinearity as the feature that makes Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) bothlearnable (sublinear regret) and feasible (regret that is polynomial in $H$).We define a novel MDP representation class, namely Locally Linearizable MDPs,generalizing other representation classes like Linear MDPs and MDPS with lowinherent Belmman error. Then, i) we introduce Cinderella, a no-regret algorithmfor this general representation class, and ii) we show that all known learnableand feasible MDP families are representable in this class. We first show thatall known feasible MDPs belong to a family that we call Mildly Smooth MDPs.Then, we show how any mildly smooth MDP can be represented as a LocallyLinearizable MDP by an appropriate choice of representation. This way,Cinderella is shown to achieve state-of-the-art regret bounds for allpreviously known (and some new) continuous MDPs for which RL is learnable andfeasible.</description><author>Davide Maran, Alberto Maria Metelli, Matteo Papini, Marcello Restelli</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:07:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24071v1</guid></item><item><title>Dynamical similarity analysis uniquely captures how computations develop in RNNs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24070v1</link><description>Methods for analyzing representations in neural systems are increasinglypopular tools in neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability. Measurescomparing neural activations across conditions, architectures, and species givescalable ways to understand information transformation within different neuralnetworks. However, recent findings show that some metrics respond to spurioussignals, leading to misleading results. Establishing benchmark test cases isthus essential for identifying the most reliable metric and potentialimprovements. We propose that compositional learning in recurrent neuralnetworks (RNNs) can provide a test case for dynamical representation alignmentmetrics. Implementing this case allows us to evaluate if metrics can identifyrepresentations that develop throughout learning and determine ifrepresentations identified by metrics reflect the network's actualcomputations. Building both attractor and RNN based test cases, we show thatthe recently proposed Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA) is more noise robustand reliably identifies behaviorally relevant representations compared to priormetrics (Procrustes, CKA). We also demonstrate how such test cases can extendbeyond metric evaluation to study new architectures. Specifically, testing DSAin modern (Mamba) state space models suggests that these models, unlike RNNs,may not require changes in recurrent dynamics due to their expressive hiddenstates. Overall, we develop test cases that showcase how DSA's enhanced abilityto detect dynamical motifs makes it highly effective for identifying ongoingcomputations in RNNs and revealing how networks learn tasks.</description><author>Quentin Guilhot, Jascha Achterberg, Michał Wójcik, Rui Ponte Costa</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:07:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24070v1</guid></item><item><title>Revealing Fine-Grained Values and Opinions in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19238v2</link><description>Uncovering latent values and opinions embedded in large language models(LLMs) can help identify biases and mitigate potential harm. Recently, this hasbeen approached by prompting LLMs with survey questions and quantifying thestances in the outputs towards morally and politically charged statements.However, the stances generated by LLMs can vary greatly depending on how theyare prompted, and there are many ways to argue for or against a given position.In this work, we propose to address this by analysing a large and robustdataset of 156k LLM responses to the 62 propositions of the Political CompassTest (PCT) generated by 6 LLMs using 420 prompt variations. We performcoarse-grained analysis of their generated stances and fine-grained analysis ofthe plain text justifications for those stances. For fine-grained analysis, wepropose to identify tropes in the responses: semantically similar phrases thatare recurrent and consistent across different prompts, revealing naturalpatterns in the text that a given LLM is prone to produce. We find thatdemographic features added to prompts significantly affect outcomes on the PCT,reflecting bias, as well as disparities between the results of tests wheneliciting closed-form vs. open domain responses. Additionally, patterns in theplain text rationales via tropes show that similar justifications arerepeatedly generated across models and prompts even with disparate stances.</description><author>Dustin Wright, Arnav Arora, Nadav Borenstein, Srishti Yadav, Serge Belongie, Isabelle Augenstein</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 16:06:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19238v2</guid></item><item><title>FairSkin: Fair Diffusion for Skin Disease Image Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22551v2</link><description>Image generation is a prevailing technique for clinical data augmentation foradvancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing healthcare disparities.

(2) The ability of the downstream-tasklearner to learn critical features from disease images varies across differentskin tones. These biases pose significant risks, particularly in skin diseasedetection, where underrepresentation of certain skin tones can lead tomisdiagnosis or neglect of specific conditions.

Although numerous well-known benchmarks exist to evaluate modelperformance, they increasingly have insufficient headroom. As such, there is apressing need for a new generation of benchmarks challenging enough for thenext generation of LMMs. One area that LMMs show potential is graph analysis,specifically, the tasks an analyst might typically perform when interpretingfigures such as estimating the mean, intercepts or correlations of functionsand data series. In this work, we introduce GRAB, a graph analysis benchmark,fit for current and future frontier LMMs. Our benchmark is entirely synthetic,ensuring high-quality, noise-free questions. GRAB is comprised of 2170questions, covering four tasks and 23 graph properties. We evaluate 20 LMMs onGRAB, finding it to be a challenging benchmark, with the highest performingmodel attaining a score of just 21.7%. Finally, we conduct various ablations toinvestigate where the models succeed and struggle. We release GRAB to encourageprogress in this important, growing domain.</description><author>Jonathan Roberts, Kai Han, Samuel Albanie</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 17:59:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11817v1</guid></item><item><title>Efficient Exploration and Discriminative World Model Learning with an Object-Centric Abstraction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11816v1</link><description>In the face of difficult exploration problems in reinforcement learning, westudy whether giving an agent an object-centric mapping (describing a set ofitems and their attributes) allow for more efficient learning. We found thisproblem is best solved hierarchically by modelling items at a higher level ofstate abstraction to pixels, and attribute change at a higher level of temporalabstraction to primitive actions. This abstraction simplifies the transitiondynamic by making specific future states easier to predict. We make use of thisto propose a fully model-based algorithm that learns a discriminative worldmodel, plans to explore efficiently with only a count-based intrinsic reward,and can subsequently plan to reach any discovered (abstract) states. We demonstrate the model's ability to (i) efficiently solve single tasks,(ii) transfer zero-shot and few-shot across item types and environments, and(iii) plan across long horizons. Across a suite of 2D crafting and MiniHackenvironments, we empirically show our model significantly out-performsstate-of-the-art low-level methods (without abstraction), as well as performantmodel-free and model-based methods using the same abstraction. Finally, we showhow to reinforce learn low level object-perturbing policies, as well assupervise learn the object mapping itself.</description><author>Anthony GX-Chen, Kenneth Marino, Rob Fergus</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 17:59:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11816v1</guid></item><item><title>Great Memory, Shallow Reasoning: Limits of $k$NN-LMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11815v1</link><description>$K$-nearest neighbor language models ($k$NN-LMs), which integrate retrievalwith next-word prediction, have demonstrated strong performance in languagemodeling as well as downstream NLP benchmarks. These results have ledresearchers to argue that models trained on poor quality or outdated data couldperform well by employing a $k$NN extension that has access to a higher-qualitydatastore. In this work, we ask whether this improved ability to recallinformation really translates into downstream abilities. We extensivelyevaluate $k$NN-LMs on a diverse set of tasks, ranging from sentimentclassification and commonsense reasoning to multi-hop reasoning. Results showthat $k$NN-LMs excel at memory-intensive tasks, where utilizing the patterns inthe input is sufficient for determining the output, but struggle with reasoningtasks that require integrating multiple pieces of information to derive newknowledge. We further demonstrate through oracle experiments and qualitativeanalysis that even with perfect retrieval, $k$NN-LMs still fail to determinethe correct answers, placing an upper bound on their reasoning performance.Code and datastores are released at https://github.com/GSYfate/knnlm-limits/.</description><author>Shangyi Geng, Wenting Zhao, Alexander M Rush</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 17:59:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11815v1</guid></item><item><title>SynPlay: Importing Real-world Diversity for a Synthetic Human Dataset</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11814v1</link><description>We introduce Synthetic Playground (SynPlay), a new synthetic human datasetthat aims to bring out the diversity of human appearance in the real world. Wefocus on two factors to achieve a level of diversity that has not yet been seenin previous works: i) realistic human motions and poses and ii) multiple cameraviewpoints towards human instances. We first use a game engine and itslibrary-provided elementary motions to create games where virtual players cantake less-constrained and natural movements while following the game rules(i.e., rule-guided motion design as opposed to detail-guided design). We thenaugment the elementary motions with real human motions captured with a motioncapture device. To render various human appearances in the games from multipleviewpoints, we use seven virtual cameras encompassing the ground and aerialviews, capturing abundant aerial-vs-ground and dynamic-vs-static attributes ofthe scene. Through extensive and carefully-designed experiments, we show thatusing SynPlay in model training leads to enhanced accuracy over existingsynthetic datasets for human detection and segmentation. The benefit of SynPlaybecomes even greater for tasks in the data-scarce regime, such as few-shot andcross-domain learning tasks. These results clearly demonstrate that SynPlay canbe used as an essential dataset with rich attributes of complex humanappearances and poses suitable for model pretraining.

The adapter serves asthe critical bridge between the visual and language components. However,training adapters with image-level supervision often results in significantmisalignment, undermining the LLMs' capabilities and limiting the potential ofMultimodal LLMs. To address this, we introduce Supervised Embedding Alignment(SEA), a token-level alignment method that leverages vision-languagepre-trained models, such as CLIP, to align visual tokens with the LLM'sembedding space through contrastive learning. This approach ensures a morecoherent integration of visual and language representations, enhancing theperformance and interpretability of multimodal LLMs while preserving theirinherent capabilities. Extensive experiments show that SEA effectively improvesMLLMs, particularly for smaller models, without adding extra data or inferencecomputation. SEA also lays the groundwork for developing more general andadaptable solutions to enhance multimodal systems.</description><author>Yuanyang Yin, Yaqi Zhao, Yajie Zhang, Ke Lin, Jiahao Wang, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang, Baoqun Yin, Wentao Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 17:58:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11813v1</guid></item><item><title>Scaling Cross-Embodied Learning: One Policy for Manipulation, Navigation, Locomotion and Aviation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11812v1</link><description>Modern machine learning systems rely on large datasets to attain broadgeneralization, and this often poses a challenge in robot learning, where eachrobotic platform and task might have only a small dataset. By training a singlepolicy across many different kinds of robots, a robot learning method canleverage much broader and more diverse datasets, which in turn can lead tobetter generalization and robustness. However, training a single policy onmulti-robot data is challenging because robots can have widely varying sensors,actuators, and control frequencies. We propose CrossFormer, a scalable andflexible transformer-based policy that can consume data from any embodiment. Wetrain CrossFormer on the largest and most diverse dataset to date, 900Ktrajectories across 20 different robot embodiments. We demonstrate that thesame network weights can control vastly different robots, including single anddual arm manipulation systems, wheeled robots, quadcopters, and quadrupeds.Unlike prior work, our model does not require manual alignment of theobservation or action spaces. Extensive experiments in the real world show thatour method matches the performance of specialist policies tailored for eachembodiment, while also significantly outperforming the prior state of the artin cross-embodiment learning.</description><author>Ria Doshi, Homer Walke, Oier Mees, Sudeep Dasari, Sergey Levine</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 17:57:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11812v1</guid></item><item><title>EmbodiedSAM: Online Segment Any 3D Thing in Real Time</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11811v1</link><description>Embodied tasks require the agent to fully understand 3D scenes simultaneouslywith its exploration, so an online, real-time, fine-grained andhighly-generalized 3D perception model is desperately needed. Sincehigh-quality 3D data is limited, directly training such a model in 3D is almostinfeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) has revolutionized thefield of 2D computer vision with superior performance, which makes the use ofVFM to assist embodied 3D perception a promising direction. However, mostexisting VFM-assisted 3D perception methods are either offline or too slow thatcannot be applied in practical embodied tasks. In this paper, we aim toleverage Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time 3D instance segmentation inan online setting. This is a challenging problem since future frames are notavailable in the input streaming RGB-D video, and an instance may be observedin several frames so object matching between frames is required. To addressthese challenges, we first propose a geometric-aware query lifting module torepresent the 2D masks generated by SAM by 3D-aware queries, which is theniteratively refined by a dual-level query decoder. In this way, the 2D masksare transferred to fine-grained shapes on 3D point clouds. Benefit from thequery representation for 3D masks, we can compute the similarity matrix betweenthe 3D masks from different views by efficient matrix operation, which enablesreal-time inference. Experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, SceneNN and 3RScanshow our method achieves leading performance even compared with offlinemethods. Our method also demonstrates great generalization ability in severalzero-shot dataset transferring experiments and show great potential inopen-vocabulary and data-efficient setting.

These methods are costly andspecifically target prevalent Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), whilePixel-domain Diffusion Models (PDMs) remain largely unexplored and robustagainst such attacks. Our work addresses this gap by proposing a novelattacking framework with a feature representation attack loss that exploitsvulnerabilities in denoising UNets and a latent optimization strategy toenhance the naturalness of protected images. Extensive experiments demonstratethe effectiveness of our approach in attacking dominant PDM-based editingmethods (e.g., SDEdit) while maintaining reasonable protection fidelity androbustness against common defense methods. Additionally, our framework isextensible to LDMs, achieving comparable performance to existing approaches.</description><author>Chun-Yen Shih, Li-Xuan Peng, Jia-Wei Liao, Ernie Chu, Cheng-Fu Chou, Jun-Cheng Chen</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 17:56:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11810v1</guid></item><item><title>MagicDec: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Tradeoff for Long Context Generation with Speculative Decoding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11049v2</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-contextapplications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agentworkflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with lowlatency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely usedtechnique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but theconventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes.In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a highthroughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly,an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasingbatch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies thebottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and usesthese insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for highthroughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache toaddress the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size.This finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding inlong-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency withoutcompromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2xspeedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when servingbatch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

Building an efficient teleoperation system acrossdiverse robot platforms has become more crucial than ever. However, there is anotable lack of cost-effective and user-friendly teleoperation systems fordifferent end-effectors, e.g., anthropomorphic robot hands and grippers, thatcan operate across multiple platforms. To address this issue, we develop ACE, across-platform visual-exoskeleton system for low-cost dexterous teleoperation.Our system utilizes a hand-facing camera to capture 3D hand poses and anexoskeleton mounted on a portable base, enabling accurate real-time capture ofboth finger and wrist poses. Compared to previous systems, which often requirehardware customization according to different robots, our single system cangeneralize to humanoid hands, arm-hands, arm-gripper, and quadruped-grippersystems with high-precision teleoperation. This enables imitation learning forcomplex manipulation tasks on diverse platforms.</description><author>Shiqi Yang, Minghuan Liu, Yuzhe Qin, Runyu Ding, Jialong Li, Xuxin Cheng, Ruihan Yang, Sha Yi, Xiaolong Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 17:48:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11805v1</guid></item><item><title>Approaching Deep Learning through the Spectral Dynamics of Weights</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11804v1</link><description>We propose an empirical approach centered on the spectral dynamics of weights-- the behavior of singular values and vectors during optimization -- to unifyand clarify several phenomena in deep learning. We identify a consistent biasin optimization across various experiments, from small-scale ``grokking'' tolarge-scale tasks like image classification with ConvNets, image generationwith UNets, speech recognition with LSTMs, and language modeling withTransformers. We also demonstrate that weight decay enhances this bias beyondits role as a norm regularizer, even in practical systems. Moreover, we showthat these spectral dynamics distinguish memorizing networks from generalizingones, offering a novel perspective on this longstanding conundrum.Additionally, we leverage spectral dynamics to explore the emergence ofwell-performing sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and the structure of theloss surface through linear mode connectivity. Our findings suggest thatspectral dynamics provide a coherent framework to better understand thebehavior of neural networks across diverse settings.</description><author>David Yunis, Kumar Kshitij Patel, Samuel Wheeler, Pedro Savarese, Gal Vardi, Karen Livescu, Michael Maire, Matthew R.

Although DNN models deployed at the edge are promising for providing AIas a service with low latency, their cooperation is yet to be explored. In thispaper, we consider that DNN service providers share their computing resourcesas well as their models' parameters and allow other DNNs to offload theircomputations without mirroring. We propose a novel algorithm called coordinatedDNNs on edge (\textbf{CoDE}) that facilitates coordination among DNN servicesby establishing new inference paths. CoDE aims to find the optimal path, whichis the path with the highest possible reward, by creating multi-task DNNs fromindividual models. The reward reflects the inference throughput and modelaccuracy. With CoDE, DNN models can make new paths for inference by using theirown or other models' parameters. We then evaluate the performance of CoDEthrough numerical experiments. The results demonstrate a $40\%$ increase in theinference throughput while degrading the average accuracy by only $2.3\%$.Experiments show that CoDE enhances the inference throughput and, achieveshigher precision compared to a state-of-the-art existing method.</description><author>Alireza Maleki, Hamed Shah-Mansouri, Babak H.

We introduce LongVILA, a full-stacksolution for long-context visual-language models by co-designing the algorithmand system. For model training, we upgrade existing VLMs to support long videounderstanding by incorporating two additional stages, i.e., long contextextension and long supervised fine-tuning. However, training on long video iscomputationally and memory intensive. We introduce the long-context Multi-ModalSequence Parallelism (MM-SP) system that efficiently parallelizes long videotraining and inference, enabling 2M context length training on 256 GPUs withoutany gradient checkpointing. LongVILA efficiently extends the number of videoframes of VILA from 8 to 1024, improving the long video captioning score from2.00 to 3.26 (out of 5), achieving 99.5% accuracy in 1400-frame (274k contextlength) video needle-in-a-haystack. LongVILA-8B demonstrates consistentaccuracy improvements on long videos in the VideoMME benchmark as the number offrames increases. Besides, MM-SP is 2.1x - 5.7x faster than ring sequenceparallelism and 1.1x - 1.4x faster than Megatron with context parallelism +tensor parallelism. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with Hugging FaceTransformers.</description><author>Fuzhao Xue, Yukang Chen, Dacheng Li, Qinghao Hu, Ligeng Zhu, Xiuyu Li, Yunhao Fang, Haotian Tang, Shang Yang, Zhijian Liu, Ethan He, Hongxu Yin, Pavlo Molchanov, Jan Kautz, Linxi Fan, Yuke Zhu, Yao Lu, Song Han</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 17:47:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10188v3</guid></item><item><title>Story3D-Agent: Exploring 3D Storytelling Visualization with Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11801v1</link><description>Traditional visual storytelling is complex, requiring specialized knowledgeand substantial resources, yet often constrained by human creativity andcreation precision.

The prevailing methodologies primarily fall into twocategories: self-attention-based and cross-attention-based methods. Whileself-attention-based methods offer superior data efficiency due to their simpleMLP architecture, they often suffer from lower computational efficiency due toconcatenating visual and textual tokens as input for LLM. Conversely,cross-attention-based methods, although less data-efficient due to additionallearnable parameters, exhibit higher computational efficiency by avoiding longsequence input for LLM. To address these trade-offs, we introduce theData-Efficient and Compute-Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model (EE-MLLM).Without introducing additional modules or learnable parameters, EE-MLLMachieves both data and compute efficiency. Specifically, we modify the originalself-attention mechanism in MLLM to a composite attention mechanism. Thismechanism has two key characteristics: 1) Eliminating the computationaloverhead of self-attention within visual tokens to achieve compute efficiency,and 2) Reusing the weights on each layer of LLM to facilitate effectivemodality alignment between vision and language for data efficiency.Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EE-MLLM across a range ofbenchmarks, including general-purpose datasets like MMBench and SeedBench, aswell as fine-grained tasks such as TextVQA and DocVQA.</description><author>Feipeng Ma, Yizhou Zhou, Hebei Li, Zilong He, Siying Wu, Fengyun Rao, Yueyi Zhang, Xiaoyan Sun</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 17:36:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11795v1</guid></item><item><title>NYU CTF Dataset: A Scalable Open-Source Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating LLMs in Offensive Security</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05590v2</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) are being deployed across various domains today.However, their capacity to solve Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges incybersecurity has not been thoroughly evaluated.

Our framework, CALM (Competence-based Analysis ofLanguage Models), is designed to investigate LLM competence in the context ofspecific tasks by intervening on models' internal representations of differentlinguistic properties using causal probing, and measuring models' alignmentunder these interventions with a given ground-truth causal model of the task.We also develop a new approach for performing causal probing interventionsusing gradient-based adversarial attacks, which can target a broader range ofproperties and representations than prior techniques. Finally, we carry out acase study of CALM using these interventions to analyze and compare LLMcompetence across a variety of lexical inference tasks, showing that CALM canbe used to explain and predict behaviors across these tasks.</description><author>Adam Davies, Jize Jiang, ChengXiang Zhai</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 17:27:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00333v4</guid></item><item><title>Leveraging Chemistry Foundation Models to Facilitate Structure Focused Retrieval Augmented Generation in Multi-Agent Workflows for Catalyst and Materials Design</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11793v1</link><description>Molecular property prediction and generative design via deep learning modelshas been the subject of intense research given its potential to acceleratedevelopment of new, high-performance materials.

This limits the capabilities of reward models as they must reasonimplicitly about the quality of a response, i.e., preference modeling must beperformed in a single forward pass through the model. To enable reward modelsto reason explicitly about the quality of a response, we introduceCritique-out-Loud (CLoud) reward models. CLoud reward models operate by firstgenerating a natural language critique of the assistant's response that is thenused to predict a scalar reward for the quality of the response. We demonstratethe success of CLoud reward models for both Llama-3-8B and 70B base models:compared to classic reward models CLoud reward models improve pairwisepreference classification accuracy on RewardBench by 4.65 and 5.84 percentagepoints for the 8B and 70B base models respectively. Furthermore, CLoud rewardmodels lead to a Pareto improvement for win rate on ArenaHard when used as thescoring model for Best-of-N.

In this paper, wepresent a comprehensive survey of existing works on emerging and pressing biasand unfairness issues in IR systems when the integration of LLMs. We firstunify bias and unfairness issues as distribution mismatch problems, providing agroundwork for categorizing various mitigation strategies through distributionalignment. Subsequently, we systematically delve into the specific bias andunfairness issues arising from three critical stages of LLMs integration intoIR systems: data collection, model development, and result evaluation. In doingso, we meticulously review and analyze recent literature, focusing on thedefinitions, characteristics, and corresponding mitigation strategiesassociated with these issues. Finally, we identify and highlight some openproblems and challenges for future work, aiming to inspire researchers andstakeholders in the IR field and beyond to better understand and mitigate biasand unfairness issues of IR in this LLM era.

Despiteits strengths, the original SAM presents limited adaptation to medical images.Moreover, SAM requires providing manual bounding box prompts for each object toproduce satisfactory segmentation masks, so it is laborious in nucleisegmentation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose adomain-generalizable framework for nuclei image segmentation, abbreviated toNuSegDG. Specifically, we first devise a Heterogeneous Space Adapter(HS-Adapter) to learn multi-dimensional feature representations of differentnuclei domains by injecting a small number of trainable parameters into theimage encoder of SAM. To alleviate the labor-intensive requirement of manualprompts, we introduce a Gaussian-Kernel Prompt Encoder (GKP-Encoder) togenerate density maps driven by a single point, which guides segmentationpredictions by mixing position prompts and semantic prompts. Furthermore, wepresent a Two-Stage Mask Decoder (TSM-Decoder) to effectively convert semanticmasks to instance maps without the manual demand for morphological shaperefinement.

To address thisgap, we introduce the concept of Personality Alignment. This approach tailorsLLMs' responses and decisions to match the specific preferences of individualusers or closely related groups. Inspired by psychometrics, we created thePersonality Alignment with Personality Inventories (PAPI) dataset, whichincludes data from 300,000 real subjects, each providing behavioral preferencesbased on the Big Five Personality Factors. This dataset allows us toquantitatively evaluate the extent to which LLMs can align with each subject'sbehavioral patterns. Recognizing the challenges of personality alignments: suchas limited personal data, diverse preferences, and scalability requirements: wedeveloped an activation intervention optimization method. This method enhancesLLMs' ability to efficiently align with individual behavioral preferences usingminimal data and computational resources. Remarkably, our method, PAS, achievessuperior performance while requiring only 1/5 of the optimization time comparedto DPO, offering practical value for personality alignment.

Recently, squared PCs encoding subtractive mixtures vianegative parameters have emerged as tractable models that can be exponentiallymore expressive than monotonic PCs, i.e., PCs with positive parameters only. Inthis paper, we provide a more precise theoretical characterization of theexpressiveness relationships among these models. First, we prove that squaredPCs can be less expressive than monotonic ones. Second, we formalize a novelclass of PCs -- sum of squares PCs -- that can be exponentially more expressivethan both squared and monotonic PCs. Around sum of squares PCs, we build anexpressiveness hierarchy that allows us to precisely unify and separatedifferent tractable model classes such as Born Machines and PSD models, andother recently introduced tractable probabilistic models by using complexparameters.

This has driven the development of numerous methods to explorebetter ways of fusing them while preserving their respectivecharacteristics.Mamba, as a state space model, has emerged in the field ofnatural language processing. Recently, many studies have attempted to extendMamba to vision tasks. However, due to the nature of images different fromcausal language sequences, the limited state capacity of Mamba weakens itsability to model image information. Additionally, the sequence modeling abilityof Mamba is only capable of spatial information and cannot effectively capturethe rich spectral information in images. Motivated by these challenges, wecustomize and improve the vision Mamba network designed for the image fusiontask. Specifically, we propose the local-enhanced vision Mamba block, dubbed asLEVM. The LEVM block can improve local information perception of the networkand simultaneously learn local and global spatial information. Furthermore, wepropose the state sharing technique to enhance spatial details and integratespatial and spectral information.

In thispaper we present KOSMOS-2.5, a multimodal literate model for machine reading oftext-intensive images. Pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of text-intensiveimages, KOSMOS-2.5 excels in two distinct yet complementary transcriptiontasks: (1) generating spatially-aware text blocks, where each block of text isassigned spatial coordinates within the image, and (2) producing structuredtext output that captures both style and structure in markdown format. Thisunified multimodal literate capability is achieved through a shareddecoder-only autoregressive Transformer architecture and task-specific prompts.Building on this foundation, we fine-tune KOSMOS-2.5 for document understandingtasks, resulting in a document understanding generalist named KOSMOS-2.5-CHAT.Additionally, a large corpus of 357.4 million document pages spanning diversedomains was curated for pre-training.

To resolve these issues, we propose a newdefinition of hypergraph that unifies the concepts of undirected, directed andnested hypergraphs, and that is uniform in using hyperedge as a singleconstruct for representing high-order correlations among things, i.e., nodesand hyperedges. Specifically, we define a hyperedge to be a simple hyperedge, anesting hyperedge, or a directed hyperedge. With this new definition, ahypergraph is nested if it has nesting hyperedge(s), and is directed if it hasdirected hyperedge(s). Otherwise, a hypergraph is a simple hypergraph. Theuniformity and power of this new definition, with visualization, shouldfacilitate the use of hypergraph for representing (hierarchical) high-ordercorrelations in general and chemical systems in particular. Graph has beenwidely used as a mathematical structure for machine learning on molecularstructures and 3D molecular geometries. However, graph has a major limitation:it can represent only pairwise correlations between nodes. Hypergraph extendsgraph with high-order correlations among nodes. This extension is significantor essential for machine learning on chemical systems. For molecules, this issignificant as it allows the direct, explicit representation of multicenterbonds and molecular substructures. For chemical reactions, this is essentialsince most chemical reactions involve multiple participants. We propose the useof chemical hypergraph, a multilevel hypergraph with simple, nesting anddirected hyperedges, as a single mathematical structure for representingchemical systems.

(iii) Our candidate model, optimized with the proposedloss function, shows an improvement of $\sim$7%, $\sim$4%, and $\sim$3% for ARpatches within $\pm$30$^\circ$, $\pm$60$^\circ$, and $\pm$90$^\circ$ of solarlongitude, respectively in terms of CSS, when compared with standard BCE.Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to issue flare forecasts for ARs innear-limb regions (regions between $\pm$60$^{\circ}$ to $\pm$90$^{\circ}$) witha CSS=0.34 (TSS=0.50 and HSS=0.23), expanding the scope of AR-based models forsolar flare prediction. This advances the reliability of solar flare forecasts,leading to more effective prediction capabilities.</description><author>Chetraj Pandey, Anli Ji, Jinsu Hong, Rafal A.

Here, we investigate an evolutionaryprocess underpinning the emergence and stylization of contemporaryuser-generated visual art styles using the complexity-entropy (C-H) plane,which quantifies local structures in paintings. Informatizing 149,780 imagescurated in DeviantArt and Behance platforms from 2010 to 2020, we analyze therelationship between local information of the C-H space and multi-level imagefeatures generated by a deep neural network and a feature extraction algorithm.The results reveal significant statistical relationships between the C-Hinformation of visual artistic styles and the dissimilarities of themulti-level image features over time within groups of artworks.

Intriguingly, from the observation of heterophilous data, wenotice that certain high-order information exhibits higher homophily, whichmotivates us to involve high-order information in node representation learning.However, common practices in GNNs to acquire high-order information mainlythrough increasing model depth and altering message-passing mechanisms, which,albeit effective to a certain extent, suffer from three shortcomings: 1)over-smoothing due to excessive model depth and propagation times; 2)high-order information is not fully utilized; 3) low computational efficiency.In this regard, we design a similarity-based path sampling strategy to capturesmooth paths containing high-order homophily. Then we propose a lightweightmodel based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), named PathMLP, which can encodemessages carried by paths via simple transformation and concatenationoperations, and effectively learn node representations in heterophilous graphsthrough adaptive path aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ourmethod outperforms baselines on 16 out of 20 datasets, underlining itseffectiveness and superiority in alleviating the heterophily problem.

Despite its clearimportance, there has been minimal work that explains how fine-tuning altersthe underlying capabilities learned by a model during pretraining: doesfine-tuning yield entirely novel capabilities or does it just modulate existingones? We address this question empirically in synthetic, controlled settingswhere we can use mechanistic interpretability tools (e.g., network pruning andprobing) to understand how the model's underlying capabilities are changing. Weperform an extensive analysis of the effects of fine-tuning in these settings,and show that: (i) fine-tuning rarely alters the underlying model capabilities;(ii) a minimal transformation, which we call a 'wrapper', is typically learnedon top of the underlying model capabilities, creating the illusion that theyhave been modified; and (iii) further fine-tuning on a task where such hiddencapabilities are relevant leads to sample-efficient 'revival' of thecapability, i.e., the model begins reusing these capability after only a fewgradient steps. This indicates that practitioners can unintentionally remove amodel's safety wrapper merely by fine-tuning it on a, e.g., superficiallyunrelated, downstream task. We additionally perform analysis on language modelstrained on the TinyStories dataset to support our claims in a more realisticsetup.</description><author>Samyak Jain, Robert Kirk, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Robert P.

However, designing and setting up interfaces for human-robotcollaboration is challenging, requiring the integration of multiple components,from perception and robot task control to the hardware itself. Frequently, thisleads to highly customized solutions that rely on large amounts of costlytraining data, diverging from the ideal of flexible and general interfaces thatempower robots to perceive and adapt to unstructured environments where theycan naturally collaborate with humans. To overcome these challenges, this paperpresents the Detection-Robot Management GPT (D-RMGPT), a robot-assistedassembly planner based on Large Multimodal Models (LMM). This system can assistinexperienced operators in assembly tasks without requiring any markers orprevious training. D-RMGPT is composed of DetGPT-V and R-ManGPT. DetGPT-V,based on GPT-4V(vision), perceives the surrounding environment through one-shotanalysis of prompted images of the current assembly stage and the list ofcomponents to be assembled. It identifies which components have already beenassembled by analysing their features and assembly requirements. R-ManGPT,based on GPT-4, plans the next component to be assembled and generates therobot's discrete actions to deliver it to the human co-worker. Experimentaltests on assembling a toy aircraft demonstrated that D-RMGPT is flexible andintuitive to use, achieving an assembly success rate of 83% while reducing theassembly time for inexperienced operators by 33% compared to the manualprocess. http://robotics-and-ai.github.io/LMMmodels/</description><author>M.

However, inreal-world scenarios, objects or scenes often exhibit perturbations of asymmetric system, specifically a deviation from a symmetric architecture, whichcan be characterized by a non-trivial action of a symmetry group, known asSymmetry-Breaking. Traditional GConv methods are limited by the strictoperation rules in the group space, only ensuring features remain strictlyequivariant under limited group transformations, making it difficult to adaptto Symmetry-Breaking or non-rigid transformations. Motivated by this, weintroduce a novel Relaxed Rotation GConv (R2GConv) with our defined RelaxedRotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{R}_4$.

In response, the burgeoning field of LLM Security aims tostudy and defend against such threats. Thus far, the majority of works in thisarea have focused on monolingual English models, however, emerging researchsuggests that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to various attacks thantheir monolingual counterparts. While previous work has investigated embeddinginversion over a small subset of European languages, it is challenging toextrapolate these findings to languages from different linguistic families andwith differing scripts. To this end, we explore the security of multilingualLLMs in the context of embedding inversion attacks and investigatecross-lingual and cross-script inversion across 20 languages, spanning over 8language families and 12 scripts. Our findings indicate that languages writtenin Arabic script and Cyrillic script are particularly vulnerable to embeddinginversion, as are languages within the Indo-Aryan language family. We furtherobserve that inversion models tend to suffer from language confusion, sometimesgreatly reducing the efficacy of an attack. Accordingly, we systematicallyexplore this bottleneck for inversion models, uncovering predictable patternswhich could be leveraged by attackers. Ultimately, this study aims to furtherthe field's understanding of the outstanding security vulnerabilities facingmultilingual LLMs and raise awareness for the languages most at risk ofnegative impact from these attacks.</description><author>Yiyi Chen, Russa Biswas, Heather Lent, Johannes Bjerva</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 16:16:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11749v1</guid></item><item><title>DH-Bench: Probing Depth and Height Perception of Large Visual-Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11748v1</link><description>Geometric understanding is crucial for navigating and interacting with ourenvironment.

However, this paper reveals acompelling finding: transformers exhibit considerable redundancy in pretrainingcomputations, which motivates our proposed solution, Mixed Sparsity Training(MST), an efficient pretraining method that can reduce about $75\%$ of FloatingPoint Operations (FLOPs) while maintaining performance. MST integrates dynamicsparse training (DST) with Sparsity Variation (SV) and Hybrid Sparse Attention(HSA) during pretraining, involving three distinct phases: warm-up,ultra-sparsification, and restoration. The warm-up phase transforms the densemodel into a sparse one, and the restoration phase reinstates connections.Throughout these phases, the model is trained with a dynamically evolvingsparse topology and an HSA mechanism to maintain performance and minimizetraining FLOPs concurrently.

Quantization not only reduces modelsize, but has also been shown to yield substantial speedups for single-userinference, due to reduced memory movement, with low accuracy impact. Yet, itremains open whether speedups are achievable also in \emph{batched} settingswith multiple parallel clients, which are highly relevant for practicalserving. It is unclear whether GPU kernels can be designed to remainpractically memory-bound, while supporting the substantially increased computerequirements of batched workloads. This paper resolves this question positively by describing the design ofMixed-precision Auto-Regressive LINear kernels, called MARLIN. Concretely,given a model whose weights are compressed via quantization to, e.g., 4 bitsper element, MARLIN shows that batchsizes up to 16-32 can be supported withclose to maximum ($4\times$) quantization speedup, and larger batchsizes up to64-128 with gradually decreasing, but still significant, acceleration. MARLINaccomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as asynchronous memoryaccess, complex task scheduling and pipelining, and bespoke quantizationsupport. Our experiments show that MARLIN's near-optimal performance onindividual LLM layers across different scenarios can also lead to end-to-endLLM inference speedups (of up to $2.8\times$) when integrated with the popularvLLM serving engine. Finally, MARLIN is extensible to further compressiontechniques, like NVIDIA 2:4 sparsity, leading to additional speedups.</description><author>Elias Frantar, Roberto L.

Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required fortraditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient inreal-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. Weobserve that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of videosamples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apartspatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motioninformation via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without consideringdensity, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, wepropose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOralfrAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with sucharchitecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different featurechannels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead ofsimple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured,using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information thanadjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts furtherprovides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-artperformance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101,and HMDB51.

Sparse deep learning addresses thesechallenges by recovering a sparse representation of the underlying targetfunction by reducing heavily over-parameterized deep neural networks.Specifically, deep neural architectures compressed via structured sparsity(e.g. node sparsity) provide low latency inference, higher data throughput, andreduced energy consumption. In this paper, we explore two well-establishedshrinkage techniques, Lasso and Horseshoe, for model compression in Bayesianneural networks. To this end, we propose structurally sparse Bayesian neuralnetworks which systematically prune excessive nodes with (i) Spike-and-SlabGroup Lasso (SS-GL), and (ii) Spike-and-Slab Group Horseshoe (SS-GHS) priors,and develop computationally tractable variational inference includingcontinuous relaxation of Bernoulli variables. We establish the contractionrates of the variational posterior of our proposed models as a function of thenetwork topology, layer-wise node cardinalities, and bounds on the networkweights. We empirically demonstrate the competitive performance of our modelscompared to the baseline models in prediction accuracy, model compression, andinference latency.</description><author>Sanket Jantre, Shrijita Bhattacharya, Tapabrata Maiti</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 16:01:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09104v2</guid></item><item><title>Clinical Insights: A Comprehensive Review of Language Models in Medicine</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11735v1</link><description>This paper provides a detailed examination of the advancements andapplications of large language models in the healthcare sector, with aparticular emphasis on clinical applications.

SSLaims to construct supervision signals directly from the data, which minimizesthe need for expensive expert annotation and maximizes the use of the expandingdata pool for a foundational model. This study investigates an effective SSLmethod for SAR ATR, which can pave the way for a foundation model in SAR ATR.The primary obstacles faced in SSL for SAR ATR are the small targets in remotesensing and speckle noise in SAR images, corresponding to the SSL approach andsignals. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel Joint-EmbeddingPredictive Architecture for SAR ATR (SAR-JEPA), which leverages local maskedpatches to predict the multi-scale SAR gradient representations of unseencontext. The key aspect of SAR-JEPA is integrating SAR domain features toensure high-quality self-supervised signals as target features. Besides, weemploy local masks and multi-scale features to accommodate the various smalltargets in remote sensing. By fine-tuning and evaluating our framework on threetarget recognition datasets (vehicle, ship, and aircraft) with four otherdatasets as pre-training, we demonstrate its outperformance over other SSLmethods and its effectiveness with increasing SAR data.

However, these models can beexploited by malicious individuals who craft toxic prompts to elicit harmful orunethical responses. These individuals often employ jailbreaking techniques tobypass safety mechanisms, highlighting the need for robust toxic promptdetection methods. Existing detection techniques, both blackbox and whitebox,face challenges related to the diversity of toxic prompts, scalability, andcomputational efficiency. In response, we propose ToxicDetector, a lightweightgreybox method designed to efficiently detect toxic prompts in LLMs.ToxicDetector leverages LLMs to create toxic concept prompts, uses embeddingvectors to form feature vectors, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)classifier for prompt classification. Our evaluation on various versions of theLLama models, Gemma-2, and multiple datasets demonstrates that ToxicDetectorachieves a high accuracy of 96.39\% and a low false positive rate of 2.00\%,outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ToxicDetector'sprocessing time of 0.0780 seconds per prompt makes it highly suitable forreal-time applications.

In this paper we present a neural-networkarchitecture suitable for accurate encoding of 3D shapes in a single forwardpass. Our architecture is based on a multi-scale hybrid system incorporatinggraph-based and voxel-based components, as well as a continuouslydifferentiable decoder. The hybrid system includes a novel way of voxelizingpoint-based features in neural networks, which we show can be used incombination with oriented point-clouds to obtain smoother and more detailedreconstructions. Furthermore, our network is trained to solve the eikonalequation and only requires knowledge of the zero-level set for training andinference. This means that in contrast to most previous shape encoderarchitectures, our network is able to output valid signed distance fieldswithout explicit prior knowledge of non-zero distance values or shapeoccupancy. It also requires only a single forward-pass, instead of thelatent-code optimization used in auto-decoder methods. We further propose amodification to the loss function in case that surface normals are not welldefined, e.g., in the context of non-watertight surfaces and non-manifoldgeometry, resulting in an unsigned distance field. Overall, our system can helpto reduce the computational overhead of training and evaluating neural distancefields, as well as enabling the application to difficult geometry.</description><author>Stefan Rhys Jeske, Jonathan Klein, Dominik L.

Current models, which learn fromimage-text pairs, inherently struggle with counting, as training data cannotdepict every possible number of objects for any given object. To solve this, wepropose optimizing the generated image based on a counting loss derived from acounting model that aggregates an object\'s potential. Employing anout-of-the-box counting model is challenging for two reasons: first, the modelrequires a scaling hyperparameter for the potential aggregation that variesdepending on the viewpoint of the objects, and second, classifier guidancetechniques require modified models that operate on noisy intermediate diffusionsteps. To address these challenges, we propose an iterated online training modethat improves the accuracy of inferred images while altering the textconditioning embedding and dynamically adjusting hyperparameters. Our methodoffers three key advantages: (i) it can consider non-derivable countingtechniques based on detection models, (ii) it is a zero-shot plug-and-playsolution facilitating rapid changes to the counting techniques and imagegeneration methods, and (iii) the optimized counting token can be reused togenerate accurate images without additional optimization.

However, their use in tabulardata has been limited due to their inferior performance compared to traditionalmachine learning models (TMLs) such as XGBoost. We find that the pre-trainedknowledge of LLMs enables them to interpret new variables that appear in a testwithout additional training, a capability central to the concept ofOut-of-Variable (OOV). From the findings, we propose aLanguage-Based-Classifier (LBC), a classifier that maximizes the benefits ofLLMs to outperform TMLs on OOV tasks. LBC employs three key methodologicalstrategies: 1) Categorical changes to adjust data to better fit the model'sunderstanding, 2) Advanced order and indicator to enhance data representationto the model, and 3) Using verbalizer to map logit scores to classes duringinference to generate model predictions. These strategies, combined with thepre-trained knowledge of LBC, emphasize the model's ability to effectivelyhandle OOV tasks. We empirically and theoretically validate the superiority ofLBC. LBC is the first study to apply an LLM-based model to OOV tasks.

In the standardscenario, participants receive a training set and are expected to provide asolution for a held-out dataset kept by organizers. An essential challenge fororganizers arises when comparing algorithms' performance, assessing multipleparticipants, and ranking them. Statistical tools are often used for thispurpose; however, traditional statistical methods often fail to capturedecisive differences between systems' performance. This manuscript describes anevaluation methodology for statistically analyzing competition results andcompetition. The methodology is designed to be universally applicable; however,it is illustrated using eight natural language competitions as case studiesinvolving classification and regression problems.

Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) and itsvariants have become the default method for undirected graphical modelestimation, and are thus ubiquitous in the field. As the IPF is an iterativeapproach, it is not always readily scalable to modern high-dimensional dataregimes. In this paper we propose a novel and fast non-iterative method forpositive definite graphical model estimation in high dimensions, one thatdirectly addresses the shortcomings of IPF and its variants. In addition, theproposed method has a number of other attractive properties. First, we showformally that as the dimension p grows, the proportion of graphs for which theproposed method will outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of computationalcomplexity and performance tends to 1, affirming its efficacy in modernsettings. Second, the proposed approach can be readily combined with scalablenon-iterative thresholding-based methods for high-dimensional sparsityselection. Third, the proposed method has high-dimensional statisticalguarantees. Moreover, our numerical experiments also show that the proposedmethod achieves scalability without compromising on statistical precision.Fourth, unlike the IPF, which depends on the Gaussian likelihood, the proposedmethod is much more robust.</description><author>Kshitij Khare, Syed Rahman, Bala Rajaratnam, Jiayuan Zhou</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 15:46:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11718v1</guid></item><item><title>ControlCol: Controllability in Automatic Speaker Video Colorization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11711v1</link><description>Adding color to black-and-white speaker videos automatically is a highlydesirable technique.

Traditional methodswidely adopt static adaptation relying on a fixed parameter space to learn fromdata that arrive sequentially, prone to overfitting to the current session.Existing dynamic strategies require the expansion of the parameter spacecontinually, leading to increased complexity. In this study, we explore thepotential of Selective State Space Models (SSMs) for FSCIL, leveraging itsdynamic weights and strong ability in sequence modeling to address thesechallenges. Concretely, we propose a dual selective SSM projector thatdynamically adjusts the projection parameters based on the intermediatefeatures for dynamic adaptation. The dual design enables the model to maintainthe robust features of base classes, while adaptively learning distinctivefeature shifts for novel classes. Additionally, we develop a class-sensitiveselective scan mechanism to guide dynamic adaptation. It minimizes thedisruption to base-class representations caused by training on novel data, andmeanwhile, forces the selective scan to perform in distinct patterns betweenbase and novel classes.

However,ensuring the prompt-image alignment remains a considerable challenge, i.e.,generating images that faithfully align with the prompt's semantics. Recentworks attempt to improve the faithfulness by optimizing the latent code, whichpotentially could cause the latent code to go out-of-distribution and thusproduce unrealistic images. In this paper, we propose FRAP, a simple, yeteffective approach based on adaptively adjusting the per-token prompt weightsto improve prompt-image alignment and authenticity of the generated images. Wedesign an online algorithm to adaptively update each token's weightcoefficient, which is achieved by minimizing a unified objective function thatencourages object presence and the binding of object-modifier pairs. Throughextensive evaluations, we show FRAP generates images with significantly higherprompt-image alignment to prompts from complex datasets, while having a loweraverage latency compared to recent latent code optimization methods, e.g., 4seconds faster than D&amp;B on the COCO-Subject dataset. Furthermore, throughvisual comparisons and evaluation on the CLIP-IQA-Real metric, we show thatFRAP not only improves prompt-image alignment but also generates more authenticimages with realistic appearances. We also explore combining FRAP with promptrewriting LLM to recover their degraded prompt-image alignment, where weobserve improvements in both prompt-image alignment and image quality.</description><author>Liyao Jiang, Negar Hassanpour, Mohammad Salameh, Mohan Sai Singamsetti, Fengyu Sun, Wei Lu, Di Niu</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 15:30:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11706v1</guid></item><item><title>FedGS: Federated Gradient Scaling for Heterogeneous Medical Image Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11701v1</link><description>Federated Learning (FL) in Deep Learning (DL)-automated medical imagesegmentation helps preserving privacy by enabling collaborative model trainingwithout sharing patient data.

However, the hardware-basedapproach for acquiring OCTA images presents challenges due to the need forspecialized sensors and expensive devices. In this paper, we introduce a novelmethod called TransPro, which can translate the readily available 3D OpticalCoherence Tomography (OCT) images into 3D OCTA images without requiring anyadditional hardware modifications. Our TransPro method is primarily driven bytwo novel ideas that have been overlooked by prior work. The first idea isderived from a critical observation that the OCTA projection map is generatedby averaging pixel values from its corresponding B-scans along the Z-axis.Hence, we introduce a hybrid architecture incorporating a 3D adversarialgenerative network and a novel Heuristic Contextual Guidance (HCG) module,which effectively maintains the consistency of the generated OCTA imagesbetween 3D volumes and projection maps. The second idea is to improve thevessel quality in the translated OCTA projection maps. As a result, we proposea novel Vessel Promoted Guidance (VPG) module to enhance the attention ofnetwork on retinal vessels. Experimental results on two datasets demonstratethat our TransPro outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with relativeimprovements around 11.4% in MAE, 2.7% in PSNR, 2% in SSIM, 40% in VDE, and9.1% in VDC compared to the baseline method.

Recentefforts, such as providing citations via retrieved documents or post-hocprovenance, enhance verifiability but still provide no guarantees on theircorrectness. To address these limitations, we tackle the verifiability goalwith a different philosophy: trivializing the verification process bydeveloping models that quote verbatim statements from trusted sources inpre-training data. We propose Quote-Tuning, and demonstrate it is feasible toalign LLMs to provide quoted statements from data memorized duringpre-training. The core of Quote-Tuning is a fast membership inference function(Marone and Van Durme, 2023) that efficiently verifies text against a trustedcorpus. We leverage this tool to design a reward function to quantify quotes inmodel responses, which is then used to create a dataset for preferencelearning. Experimental results show that Quote-Tuning significantly increasesverbatim quotes from high-quality pre-training documents by 55% to 130%relative to un-tuned models while maintaining response quality. Quote-Tuningalso generalizes quoting to out-of-domain data, is applicable in differenttasks, and provides additional benefits to truthfulness. Our method not onlyserves as a hassle-free method to increase quoting but also opens up avenuesfor improving LLM trustworthiness through better verifiability.</description><author>Jingyu Zhang, Marc Marone, Tianjian Li, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 15:23:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03862v2</guid></item><item><title>Improving global awareness of linkset predictions using Cross-Attentive Modulation tokens</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19375v3</link><description>Most of multiple link prediction or graph generation techniques rely on theattention mechanism or on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which consist inleveraging node-level information exchanges in order to form proper linkpredictions. Such node-level interactions do not process nodes as an orderedsequence, which would imply some kind of natural ordering of the nodes: theyare said to be permutation invariant mechanisms. They are well suited for graphproblems, but struggle at providing a global orchestration of the predictedlinks, which can result in a loss of performance. Some typical issues can bethe difficulty to ensure high-level properties such as global connectedness,fixed diameter or to avoid information bottleneck effects such as oversmoothingand oversquashing, which respectively consist in abundant smoothing in denseareas leading to a loss of information and a tendency to exclude isolated nodesfrom the message passing scheme, and often result in irrelevant, unbalancedlink predictions. To tackle this problem, we hereby present Cross-AttentiveModulation (CAM) tokens, which introduce cross-attentive units used tocondition node and edge-level modulations in order to enable context-awarecomputations that improve the global consistency of the prediction links. Wewill implement it on a few permutation invariant architectures, and showcasebenchmarks that prove the merits of our work.</description><author>Félix Marcoccia, Cédric Adjih, Paul Mühlethaler</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 15:21:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19375v3</guid></item><item><title>Robust 3D Gaussian Splatting for Novel View Synthesis in Presence of Distractors</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11697v1</link><description>3D Gaussian Splatting has shown impressive novel view synthesis results;nonetheless, it is vulnerable to dynamic objects polluting the input data of anotherwise static scene, so called distractors. Distractors have severe impacton the rendering quality as they get represented as view-dependent effects orresult in floating artifacts. Our goal is to identify and ignore suchdistractors during the 3D Gaussian optimization to obtain a cleanreconstruction. To this end, we take a self-supervised approach that looks atthe image residuals during the optimization to determine areas that have likelybeen falsified by a distractor. In addition, we leverage a pretrainedsegmentation network to provide object awareness, enabling more accurateexclusion of distractors. This way, we obtain segmentation masks of distractorsto effectively ignore them in the loss formulation. We demonstrate that ourapproach is robust to various distractors and strongly improves renderingquality on distractor-polluted scenes, improving PSNR by 1.86dB compared to 3DGaussian Splatting.</description><author>Paul Ungermann, Armin Ettenhofer, Matthias Nießner, Barbara Roessle</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 15:21:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11697v1</guid></item><item><title>Quantum Inception Score</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12163v4</link><description>Motivated by the great success of classical generative models in machinelearning, enthusiastic exploration of their quantum version has recentlystarted. To depart on this journey, it is important to develop a relevantmetric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classicalcase, one such example is the (classical) inception score (cIS). In this paper,as a natural extension of cIS, we propose the quantum inception score (qIS) forquantum generators. Importantly, qIS relates the quality to the Holevoinformation of the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. In thiscontext, we show several properties of qIS. First, qIS is greater than or equalto the corresponding cIS, which is defined through projection measurements onthe system output. Second, the difference between qIS and cIS arises from thepresence of quantum coherence, as characterized by the resource theory ofasymmetry. Third, when a set of entangled generators is prepared, there existsa classifying process leading to the further enhancement of qIS. Fourth, weharness the quantum fluctuation theorem to characterize the physical limitationof qIS. Finally, we apply qIS to assess the quality of the one-dimensional spinchain model as a quantum generative model, with the quantum convolutionalneural network as a quantum classifier, for the phase classification problem inthe quantum many-body physics.</description><author>Akira Sone, Akira Tanji, Naoki Yamamoto</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 15:16:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12163v4</guid></item><item><title>Carbon Connect: An Ecosystem for Sustainable Computing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13858v2</link><description>Computing is at a moment of profound opportunity. Emerging applications --such as capable artificial intelligence, immersive virtual realities, andpervasive sensor systems -- drive unprecedented demand for computer. Despiterecent advances toward net zero carbon emissions, the computing industry'sgross energy usage continues to rise at an alarming rate, outpacing the growthof new energy installations and renewable energy deployments. A shift towardssustainability is needed to spark a transformation in how computer systems aremanufactured, allocated, and consumed. Carbon Connect envisions coordinatedresearch thrusts that produce design and management strategies for sustainable,next-generation computer systems. These strategies must flatten and thenreverse growth trajectories for computing power and carbon for society's mostrapidly growing applications such as artificial intelligence and virtualspaces. We will require accurate models for carbon accounting in computingtechnology. For embodied carbon, we must re-think conventional designstrategies -- over-provisioned monolithic servers, frequent hardware refreshcycles, custom silicon -- and adopt life-cycle design strategies that moreeffectively reduce, reuse and recycle hardware at scale. For operationalcarbon, we must not only embrace renewable energy but also design systems touse that energy more efficiently. Finally, new hardware design and managementstrategies must be cognizant of economic policy and regulatory landscape,aligning private initiatives with societal goals. Many of these broader goalswill require computer scientists to develop deep, enduring collaborations withresearchers in economics, law, and industrial ecology to spark change inbroader practice.</description><author>Benjamin C.

To better understand the underlyingfactors that make models safe via safety fine-tuning, we design a syntheticdata generation framework that captures salient aspects of an unsafe input bymodeling the interaction between the task the model is asked to perform (e.g.,"design") versus the specific concepts the task is asked to be performed upon(e.g., a "cycle" vs. a "bomb"). Using this, we investigate three well-knownsafety fine-tuning methods -- supervised safety fine-tuning, direct preferenceoptimization, and unlearning -- and provide significant evidence demonstratingthat these methods minimally transform MLP weights to specifically align unsafeinputs into its weights' null space. This yields a clustering of inputs basedon whether the model deems them safe or not. Correspondingly, when anadversarial input (e.g., a jailbreak) is provided, its activations are closerto safer samples, leading to the model processing such an input as if it weresafe. We validate our findings, wherever possible, on real-world models --specifically, Llama-2 7B and Llama-3 8B.</description><author>Samyak Jain, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Kemal Oksuz, Tom Joy, Philip H. S.

However, the length presents challenges in fine-grainedinterpretability, with current AQA methods typically producing a single scoreby averaging clip features, lacking detailed semantic meanings of individualclips. Long-term videos pose additional difficulty due to the complexity anddiversity of actions, exacerbating interpretability challenges. Whilequery-based transformer networks offer promising long-term modelingcapabilities, their interpretability in AQA remains unsatisfactory due to aphenomenon we term Temporal Skipping, where the model skips self-attentionlayers to prevent output degradation. To address this, we propose an attentionloss function and a query initialization method to enhance performance andinterpretability.

However, in the process of development, backdoorattacks have brought severe challenges to security. Such attacks cause aninfected model to predict target labels when a specific trigger is activated,while the model behaves normally on benign samples. In this paper, we conductsystematic experiments to comprehend on robustness of VSS through the lens ofbackdoor attacks, specifically how the state space model (SSM) mechanismaffects robustness. We first investigate the vulnerability of VSS to differentbackdoor triggers and reveal that the SSM mechanism, which captures contextualinformation within patches, makes the VSS model more susceptible to backdoortriggers compared to models without SSM. Furthermore, we analyze thesensitivity of the VSS model to patch processing techniques and discover thatthese triggers are effectively disrupted. Based on these observations, weconsider an effective backdoor for the VSS model that recurs in each patch toresist patch perturbations. Extensive experiments across three datasets andvarious backdoor attacks reveal that the VSS model performs comparably toTransformers (ViTs) but is less robust than the Gated CNNs, which comprise onlystacked Gated CNN blocks without SSM.</description><author>Cheng-Yi Lee, Cheng-Chang Tsai, Chia-Mu Yu, Chun-Shien Lu</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 14:58:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11679v1</guid></item><item><title>Copilot-in-the-Loop: Fixing Code Smells in Copilot-Generated Python Code using Copilot</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14176v2</link><description>As one of the most popular dynamic languages, Python experiences a decreasein readability and maintainability when code smells are present.

Nevertheless, FGL still faces thechallenge of the severe non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID)nature of graphs, which possess diverse node and edge structures, especiallyacross varied domains. Thus, exploring the knowledge inherent in thesestructures becomes significantly crucial. Existing methods, however, eitheroverlook the inherent structural knowledge in graph data or capture it at thecost of significantly increased resource demands (e.g., FLOPs and communicationbandwidth), which can be detrimental to distributed paradigms. Inspired bythis, we propose FedDense, a novel FGL framework that optimizes the utilizationefficiency of inherent structural knowledge. To better acquire knowledge ofdiverse and underexploited structures, FedDense first explicitly encodes thestructural knowledge inherent within graph data itself alongside node features.Besides, FedDense introduces a Dual-Densely Connected (DDC) GNN architecturethat exploits the multi-scale (i.e., one-hop to multi-hop) feature andstructure insights embedded in the aggregated feature maps at each layer. Inaddition to the exploitation of inherent structures, we consider resourcelimitations in FGL, devising exceedingly narrow layers atop the DDCarchitecture and adopting a selective parameter sharing strategy to reduceresource costs substantially. We conduct extensive experiments using 15datasets across 4 different domains, demonstrating that FedDense consistentlysurpasses baselines by a large margin in training performance, while demandingminimal resources.</description><author>Longwen Wang, Jianchun Liu, Zhi Liu, Jinyang Huang</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 14:37:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11662v1</guid></item><item><title>GNN-SKAN: Harnessing the Power of SwallowKAN to Advance Molecular Representation Learning with GNNs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01018v2</link><description>Effective molecular representation learning is crucial for advancingmolecular property prediction and drug design. Mainstream molecularrepresentation learning approaches are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).However, these approaches struggle with three significant challenges:insufficient annotations, molecular diversity, and architectural limitationssuch as over-squashing, which leads to the loss of critical structural details.To address these challenges, we introduce a new class of GNNs that integratesthe Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), known for their robust data-fittingcapabilities and high accuracy in small-scale AI + Science tasks. Byincorporating KANs into GNNs, our model enhances the representation ofmolecular structures. We further advance this approach with a variant calledSwallowKAN (SKAN), which employs adaptive Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) as thecore of the non-linear neurons. This innovation improves both computationalefficiency and adaptability to diverse molecular structures. Building on thestrengths of SKAN, we propose a new class of GNNs, GNN-SKAN, and its augmentedvariant, GNN-SKAN+, which incorporates a SKAN-based classifier to further boostperformance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate KANs intoGNN architectures tailored for molecular representation learning.

To address this issue, we propose HeuristicallyAdjusted IF (HAIF), which reduces the weight of tokens with large gradientnorms, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of tracing the mostinfluential samples. To establish easily obtained groundtruth for tracingprivacy leakage, we construct two datasets, PII-E and PII-CR, representing twodistinct scenarios: one with identical text in the model outputs andpre-training data, and the other where models leverage their reasoningabilities to generate text divergent from pre-training data. HAIF significantlyimproves tracing accuracy, enhancing it by 20.96\% to 73.71\% on the PII-Edataset and 3.21\% to 45.93\% on the PII-CR dataset, compared to the best SOTAIFs against various GPT-2 and QWen-1.5 models. HAIF also outperforms SOTA IFson real-world pretraining data CLUECorpus2020, demonstrating strong robustnessregardless prompt and response lengths.</description><author>Jinxin Liu, Zao Yang</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 14:35:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10468v2</guid></item><item><title>Proximal Policy Optimization with Graph Neural Networks for Optimal Power Flow</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12470v2</link><description>Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a very traditional research area within the powersystems field that seeks for the optimal operation point of electric powerplants, and which needs to be solved every few minutes in real-world scenarios.However, due to the nonconvexities that arise in power generation systems,there is not yet a fast, robust solution technique for the full AlternatingCurrent Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). In the last decades, power grids haveevolved into a typical dynamic, non-linear and large-scale control system,known as the power system, so searching for better and faster ACOPF solutionsis becoming crucial. Appearance of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has allowed thenatural use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on graph data, such as powernetworks. On the other hand, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is known for itspowerful capability to solve complex decision-making problems. Althoughsolutions that use these two methods separately are beginning to appear in theliterature, none has yet combined the advantages of both. We propose a novelarchitecture based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm with GraphNeural Networks to solve the Optimal Power Flow. The objective is to design anarchitecture that learns how to solve the optimization problem and that is atthe same time able to generalize to unseen scenarios. We compare our solutionwith the DCOPF in terms of cost after having trained our DRL agent on IEEE 30bus system and then computing the OPF on that base network with topologychanges</description><author>Ángela López-Cardona, Guillermo Bernárdez, Pere Barlet-Ros, Albert Cabellos-Aparicio</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 14:35:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12470v2</guid></item></channel></rss>

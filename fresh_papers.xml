In this paper, we introduce Refined Logit Distillation (RLD) toaddress the limitations of current logit distillation methods. Our approach ismotivated by the observation that even high-performing teacher models can makeincorrect predictions, creating a conflict between the standard distillationloss and the cross-entropy loss. This conflict can undermine the consistency ofthe student model's learning objectives. Previous attempts to use labels toempirically correct teacher predictions may undermine the class correlation. Incontrast, our RLD employs labeling information to dynamically refine teacherlogits. In this way, our method can effectively eliminate misleadinginformation from the teacher while preserving crucial class correlations, thusenhancing the value and efficiency of distilled knowledge. Experimental resultson CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate its superiority over existing methods.The code is provided at \text{https://github.com/zju-SWJ/RLD}.</description><author>Wujie Sun, Defang Chen, Siwei Lyu, Genlang Chen, Chun Chen, Can Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 17:59:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07703v1</guid></item><item><title>The Death of Schema Linking? Text-to-SQL in the Age of Well-Reasoned Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07702v1</link><description>Schema linking is a crucial step in Text-to-SQL pipelines, which translatenatural language queries into SQL. The goal of schema linking is to retrieverelevant tables and columns (signal) while disregarding irrelevant ones(noise). However, imperfect schema linking can often exclude essential columnsneeded for accurate query generation. In this work, we revisit the need forschema linking when using the latest generation of large language models(LLMs). We find empirically that newer models are adept at identifying relevantschema elements during generation, without the need for explicit schemalinking. This allows Text-to-SQL pipelines to bypass schema linking entirelyand instead pass the full database schema to the LLM, eliminating the risk ofexcluding necessary information. Furthermore, as alternatives to schemalinking, we propose techniques that improve Text-to-SQL accuracy withoutcompromising on essential schema information. Our approach achieves 71.83\%execution accuracy on the BIRD benchmark, ranking first at the time ofsubmission.</description><author>Karime Maamari, Fadhil Abubaker, Daniel Jaroslawicz, Amine Mhedhbi</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 17:59:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07702v1</guid></item><item><title>Semi-Supervised Laplace Learning on Stiefel Manifolds</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00142v2</link><description>Motivated by the need to address the degeneracy of canonical Laplace learningalgorithms in low label rates, we propose to reformulate graph-basedsemi-supervised learning as a nonconvex generalization of a \emph{Trust-RegionSubproblem} (TRS). This reformulation is motivated by the well-posedness ofLaplacian eigenvectors in the limit of infinite unlabeled data. To solve thisproblem, we first show that a first-order condition implies the solution of amanifold alignment problem and that solutions to the classical \emph{OrthogonalProcrustes} problem can be used to efficiently find good classifiers that areamenable to further refinement. To tackle refinement, we develop the frameworkof Sequential Subspace Optimization for graph-based SSL. Next, we address thecriticality of selecting supervised samples at low-label rates. We characterizeinformative samples with a novel measure of centrality derived from theprincipal eigenvectors of a certain submatrix of the graph Laplacian. Wedemonstrate that our framework achieves lower classification error compared torecent state-of-the-art and classical semi-supervised learning methods atextremely low, medium, and high label rates.</description><author>Chester Holtz, Pengwen Chen, Alexander Cloninger, Chung-Kuan Cheng, Gal Mishne</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 17:57:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00142v2</guid></item><item><title>Quantifying over Optimum Answer Sets</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07697v1</link><description>Answer Set Programming with Quantifiers (ASP(Q)) has been introduced toprovide a natural extension of ASP modeling to problems in the polynomialhierarchy (PH). However, ASP(Q) lacks a method for encoding in an elegant andcompact way problems requiring a polynomial number of calls to an oracle in$\Sigma_n^p$ (that is, problems in $\Delta_{n+1}^p$). Such problems include, inparticular, optimization problems. In this paper we propose an extension ofASP(Q), in which component programs may contain weak constraints. Weakconstraints can be used both for expressing local optimization withinquantified component programs and for modeling global optimization criteria. Weshowcase the modeling capabilities of the new formalism through variousapplication scenarios. Further, we study its computational properties obtainingcomplexity results and unveiling non-obvious characteristics of ASP(Q) programswith weak constraints.</description><author>Giuseppe Mazzotta, Francesco Ricca, Mirek Truszczynski</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 17:53:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07697v1</guid></item><item><title>End-to-end Semantic-centric Video-based Multimodal Affective Computing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07694v1</link><description>In the pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), understandinghuman's affection is essential to enhance machine's cognition abilities. Forachieving more sensual human-AI interaction, Multimodal Affective Computing(MAC) in human-spoken videos has attracted increasing attention. However,previous methods are mainly devoted to designing multimodal fusion algorithms,suffering from two issues: semantic imbalance caused by diverse pre-processingoperations and semantic mismatch raised by inconsistent affection contentcontained in different modalities comparing with the multimodal ground truth.Besides, the usage of manual features extractors make they fail in buildingend-to-end pipeline for multiple MAC downstream tasks. To address abovechallenges, we propose a novel end-to-end framework named SemanticMAC tocompute multimodal semantic-centric affection for human-spoken videos. Wefirstly employ pre-trained Transformer model in multimodal data pre-processingand design Affective Perceiver module to capture unimodal affectiveinformation. Moreover, we present a semantic-centric approach to unifymultimodal representation learning in three ways, including gated featureinteraction, multi-task pseudo label generation, and intra-/inter-samplecontrastive learning. Finally, SemanticMAC effectively learn specific- andshared-semantic representations in the guidance of semantic-centric labels.Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpass thestate-of-the-art methods on 7 public datasets in four MAC downstream tasks.</description><author>Ronghao Lin, Ying Zeng, Sijie Mai, Haifeng Hu</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 17:50:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07694v1</guid></item><item><title>Detecting Near-Duplicate Face Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07689v1</link><description>Near-duplicate images are often generated when applying repeated photometricand geometric transformations that produce imperceptible variants of theoriginal image. Consequently, a deluge of near-duplicates can be circulatedonline posing copyright infringement concerns. The concerns are more severewhen biometric data is altered through such nuanced transformations. In thiswork, we address the challenge of near-duplicate detection in face images by,firstly, identifying the original image from a set of near-duplicates and,secondly, deducing the relationship between the original image and thenear-duplicates. We construct a tree-like structure, called an Image PhylogenyTree (IPT) using a graph-theoretic approach to estimate the relationship, i.e.,determine the sequence in which they have been generated. We further extend ourmethod to create an ensemble of IPTs known as Image Phylogeny Forests (IPFs).We rigorously evaluate our method to demonstrate robustness across othermodalities, unseen transformations by latest generative models and IPTconfigurations, thereby significantly advancing the state-of-the-artperformance by 42% on IPF reconstruction accuracy.</description><author>Sudipta Banerjee, Arun Ross</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 17:45:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07689v1</guid></item><item><title>Idea2Img: Iterative Self-Refinement with GPT-4V(ision) for Automatic Image Design and Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08541v2</link><description>We introduce ``Idea to Image,'' a system that enables multimodal iterativeself-refinement with GPT-4V(ision) for automatic image design and generation.Humans can quickly identify the characteristics of different text-to-image(T2I) models via iterative explorations. This enables them to efficientlyconvert their high-level generation ideas into effective T2I prompts that canproduce good images. We investigate if systems based on large multimodal models(LMMs) can develop analogous multimodal self-refinement abilities that enableexploring unknown models or environments via self-refining tries. Idea2Imgcyclically generates revised T2I prompts to synthesize draft images, andprovides directional feedback for prompt revision, both conditioned on itsmemory of the probed T2I model's characteristics. The iterative self-refinementbrings Idea2Img various advantages over vanilla T2I models. Notably, Idea2Imgcan process input ideas with interleaved image-text sequences, follow ideaswith design instructions, and generate images of better semantic and visualqualities. The user preference study validates the efficacy of multimodaliterative self-refinement on automatic image design and generation.</description><author>Zhengyuan Yang, Jianfeng Wang, Linjie Li, Kevin Lin, Chung-Ching Lin, Zicheng Liu, Lijuan Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 17:43:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08541v2</guid></item><item><title>RSD-DOG : A New Image Descriptor based on Second Order Derivatives</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07687v1</link><description>This paper introduces the new and powerful image patch descriptor based onsecond order image statistics/derivatives. Here, the image patch is treated asa 3D surface with intensity being the 3rd dimension. The considered 3D surfacehas a rich set of second order features/statistics such as ridges, valleys,cliffs and so on, that can be easily captured by using the difference ofrotating semi Gaussian filters. The originality of this method is based onsuccessfully combining the response of the directional filters with that of theDifference of Gaussian (DOG) approach.

The dataset comprises pairs of finite-time system tracesand corresponding labels, denoting whether the traces demonstrate specificdesired behaviors, e.g. whether the ship follows a safe route or not. Ourproposed approach leverages decision-tree-based methods to infer SignalTemporal Logic classifiers using primitive formulae. We formulate the inferenceprocess as a mixed integer linear programming optimization problem, recursivelygenerating constraints to determine both data classification and treestructure. Applying a max-flow algorithm on the resultant tree transforms theproblem into a global optimization challenge, leading to improvedclassification rates compared to prior methodologies. Moreover, we introduce atechnique to reduce the number of constraints by exploiting the symmetryinherent in STL primitives, which enhances the algorithm's time performance andinterpretability. To assess our algorithm's effectiveness and classificationperformance, we conduct three case studies involving two-class, multi-class,and complex formula classification scenarios.</description><author>Kaier Liang, Gustavo A.

Wepropose a modular superpixel tokenization strategy which decouples tokenizationand feature extraction; a shift from contemporary approaches where these aretreated as an undifferentiated whole. Using on-line content-aware tokenizationand scale- and shape-invariant positional embeddings, we perform experimentsand ablations that contrast our approach with patch-based tokenization andrandomized partitions as baselines. We show that our method significantlyimproves the faithfulness of attributions, gives pixel-level granularity onzero-shot unsupervised dense prediction tasks, while maintaining predictiveperformance in classification tasks. Our approach provides a modulartokenization framework commensurable with standard architectures, extending thespace of ViTs to a larger class of semantically-rich models.</description><author>Marius Aasan, Odd Kolbjørnsen, Anne Schistad Solberg, Adín Ramirez Rivera</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 17:28:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07680v1</guid></item><item><title>Robust Curve Detection in Volumetric Medical Imaging via Attraction Field</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01159v2</link><description>Understanding body part geometry is crucial for precise medical diagnostics.Curves effectively describe anatomical structures and are widely used inmedical imaging applications related to cardiovascular, respiratory, andskeletal diseases. Traditional curve detection methods are often task-specific,relying heavily on domain-specific features, limiting their broaderapplicability. This paper introduces a novel approach for detectingnon-branching curves, which does not require prior knowledge of the object'sorientation, shape, or position. Our method uses neural networks to predict (1)an attraction field, which offers subpixel accuracy, and (2) a closeness map,which limits the region of interest and essentially eliminates outliers farfrom the desired curve. We tested our curve detector on several clinicallyrelevant tasks with diverse morphologies and achieved impressive subpixel-levelaccuracy results that surpass existing methods, highlighting its versatilityand robustness. Additionally, to support further advancements in this field, weprovide our private annotations of aortic centerlines and masks, which canserve as a benchmark for future research.

This may lead FAS systemsto conclude incorrect judgments, especially in cases where it is easilydistinguishable in terms of dynamics but challenging to discern in terms ofphotometrics. To this end, we propose the Graph Guided Video Vision Transformer(G$^2$V$^2$former), which combines faces with facial landmarks for photometricand dynamic feature fusion. We factorize the attention into space and time, andfuse them via a spatiotemporal block. Specifically, we design a novel temporalattention called Kronecker temporal attention, which has a wider receptivefield, and is beneficial for capturing dynamic information. Moreover, weleverage the low-semantic motion of facial landmarks to guide the high-semanticchange of facial expressions based on the motivation that regions containinglandmarks may reveal more dynamic clues. Extensive experiments on ninebenchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performanceunder various scenarios. The codes will be released soon.</description><author>Jingyi Yang, Zitong Yu, Xiuming Ni, Jia He, Hui Li</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 17:22:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07675v1</guid></item><item><title>Time Series Predictions in Unmonitored Sites: A Survey of Machine Learning Techniques in Water Resources</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09766v3</link><description>Prediction of dynamic environmental variables in unmonitored sites remains along-standing challenge for water resources science. The majority of theworld's freshwater resources have inadequate monitoring of criticalenvironmental variables needed for management. Yet, the need to have widespreadpredictions of hydrological variables such as river flow and water quality hasbecome increasingly urgent due to climate and land use change over the pastdecades, and their associated impacts on water resources. Modern machinelearning methods increasingly outperform their process-based and empiricalmodel counterparts for hydrologic time series prediction with their ability toextract information from large, diverse data sets. We review relevantstate-of-the art applications of machine learning for streamflow, waterquality, and other water resources prediction and discuss opportunities toimprove the use of machine learning with emerging methods for incorporatingwatershed characteristics into deep learning models, transfer learning, andincorporating process knowledge into machine learning models. The analysis heresuggests most prior efforts have been focused on deep learning learningframeworks built on many sites for predictions at daily time scales in theUnited States, but that comparisons between different classes of machinelearning methods are few and inadequate. We identify several open questions fortime series predictions in unmonitored sites that include incorporating dynamicinputs and site characteristics, mechanistic understanding and spatial context,and explainable AI techniques in modern machine learning frameworks.</description><author>Jared D.

A challenging task concerning grid search is the time management.Without a good time management scheme, a grid search can easily be set off as amission that will not finish in our lifetime. In this study, we introduce aheuristic three-stage mechanism for managing the running time of low-budgetgrid searches, and the sweet-spot grid search (SSGS) and randomized grid search(RGS) strategies for improving model prediction performance, in predicting the5-year, 10-year, and 15-year risk of breast cancer metastasis. We develop deepfeedforward neural network (DFNN) models and optimize them through gridsearches. We conduct eight cycles of grid searches by applying our three-stagemechanism and SSGS and RGS strategies. We conduct various SHAP analysesincluding unique ones that interpret the importance of the DFNN-modelhyperparameters. Our results show that grid search can greatly improve modelprediction. The grid searches we conducted improved the risk prediction of5-year, 10-year, and 15-year breast cancer metastasis by 18.6%, 16.3%, and17.3% respectively, over the average performance of all corresponding models wetrained. We not only demonstrate best model performance but also characterizegrid searches from various aspects such as their capabilities of discoveringdecent models and the unit grid search time. The three-stage mechanism workedeffectively. It made our low-budget grid searches feasible and manageable, andin the meantime helped improve model prediction performance. Our SHAP analysesidentified both clinical risk factors important for the prediction of futurerisk of breast cancer metastasis, and DFNN-model hyperparameters important tothe prediction of performance scores.</description><author>Xia Jiang, Yijun Zhou, Chuhan Xu, Adam Brufsky, Alan Wells</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 17:16:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07673v1</guid></item><item><title>Data Science for Geographic Information Systems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03754v2</link><description>The integration of data science into Geographic Information Systems (GIS) hasfacilitated the evolution of these tools into complete spatial analysisplatforms.

This paperestablishes robust theoretical foundations for DRL. We prove the contractionproperty of the Bellman operator even when the reward space is aninfinite-dimensional separable Banach space. Furthermore, we demonstrate thatthe behavior of high- or infinite-dimensional returns can be effectivelyapproximated using a lower-dimensional Euclidean space. Leveraging thesetheoretical insights, we propose a novel DRL algorithm that tackles problemswhich have been previously intractable using conventional reinforcementlearning approaches.</description><author>Dong Neuck Lee, Michael R.

The framework considers encoding of a signal through spike trainsgenerated by an ensemble of neurons using a convolve-then-threshold mechanismwith various convolution kernels. A closed-form solution to the inverseproblem, from spike trains to signal reconstruction, is derived in the Hilbertspace of shifted kernel functions, ensuring sparse representation of ageneralized Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) class of signals. Additionally,inspired by real-time processing in biological systems, an efficient iterativeversion of the optimal reconstruction is formulated that considers only afinite window of past spikes, ensuring robustness of the technique toill-conditioned encoding; convergence guarantees of the windowed reconstructionto the optimal solution are then provided. Experiments on a large audio datasetdemonstrate excellent reconstruction accuracy at spike rates as low asone-fifth of the Nyquist rate, while showing clear competitive advantage incomparison to state-of-the-art sparse coding techniques in the low spike rateregime.</description><author>Anik Chattopadhyay, Arunava Banerjee</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 16:43:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05950v2</guid></item><item><title>Implicit Causal Representation Learning via Switchable Mechanisms</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11124v3</link><description>Learning causal representations from observational and interventional data inthe absence of known ground-truth graph structures necessitates implicit latentcausal representation learning. Implicit learning of causal mechanismstypically involves two categories of interventional data: hard and softinterventions. In real-world scenarios, soft interventions are often morerealistic than hard interventions, as the latter require fully controlledenvironments. Unlike hard interventions, which directly force changes in acausal variable, soft interventions exert influence indirectly by affecting thecausal mechanism. However, the subtlety of soft interventions impose severalchallenges for learning causal models. One challenge is that softintervention's effects are ambiguous, since parental relations remain intact.In this paper, we tackle the challenges of learning causal models using softinterventions while retaining implicit modelling. We propose ICLR-SM, whichmodels the effects of soft interventions by employing a causal mechanism switchvariable designed to toggle between different causal mechanisms. In ourexperiments, we consistently observe improved learning of identifiable, causalrepresentations, compared to baseline approaches.</description><author>Shayan Shirahmad Gale Bagi, Zahra Gharaee, Oliver Schulte, Mark Crowley</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 16:39:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11124v3</guid></item><item><title>Graph Triple Attention Network: A Decoupled Perspective</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07654v1</link><description>Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently achieved significant success in thegraph domain by effectively capturing both long-range dependencies and graphinductive biases. However, these methods face two primary challenges: (1)multi-view chaos, which results from coupling multi-view information(positional, structural, attribute), thereby impeding flexible usage and theinterpretability of the propagation process. (2) local-global chaos, whicharises from coupling local message passing with global attention, leading toissues of overfitting and over-globalizing. To address these challenges, wepropose a high-level decoupled perspective of GTs, breaking them down intothree components and two interaction levels: positional attention, structuralattention, and attribute attention, alongside local and global interaction.Based on this decoupled perspective, we design a decoupled graph tripleattention network named DeGTA, which separately computes multi-view attentionsand adaptively integrates multi-view local and global information. Thisapproach offers three key advantages: enhanced interpretability, flexibledesign, and adaptive integration of local and global information. Throughextensive experiments, DeGTA achieves state-of-the-art performance acrossvarious datasets and tasks, including node classification and graphclassification. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate that decoupling isessential for improving performance and enhancing interpretability.

Recent approaches in 3D dense captioninghave adopted transformer encoder-decoder frameworks from object detection tobuild an end-to-end pipeline without hand-crafted components. However, theseapproaches struggle with contradicting objectives where a single queryattention has to simultaneously view both the tightly localized object regionsand contextual environment. To overcome this challenge, we introduce SIA(See-It-All), a transformer pipeline that engages in 3D dense captioning with anovel paradigm called late aggregation. SIA simultaneously decodes two sets ofqueries-context query and instance query. The instance query focuses onlocalization and object attribute descriptions, while the context queryversatilely captures the region-of-interest of relationships between multipleobjects or with the global scene, then aggregated afterwards (i.e., lateaggregation) via simple distance-based measures. To further enhance the qualityof contextualized caption generation, we design a novel aggregator to generatea fully informed caption based on the surrounding context, the globalenvironment, and object instances. Extensive experiments on two of the mostwidely-used 3D dense captioning datasets demonstrate that our proposed methodachieves a significant improvement over prior methods.</description><author>Minjung Kim, Hyung Suk Lim, Seung Hwan Kim, Soonyoung Lee, Bumsoo Kim, Gunhee Kim</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 16:19:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07648v1</guid></item><item><title>Adaptive Behavioral AI: Reinforcement Learning to Enhance Pharmacy Services</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07647v1</link><description>Pharmacies are critical in healthcare systems, particularly in low- andmiddle-income countries.

Most RL agents exhibit a limited capacity to generalize, oftenfocusing narrowly on specific scenarios, and are usually evaluated in similaror even the same scenarios seen during training. Various methods have beenproposed to address these challenges, including experience replay andregularization. However, how observation design in RL affects sample efficiencyand generalization remains an under-explored area. We address this gap byproposing five strategies to design information-dense observations, focusing ongeneral features that are applicable to most traffic scenarios. We train our RLagents using these strategies on an intersection and evaluate theirgeneralization through numerical experiments across completely unseen trafficscenarios, including a new intersection, an on-ramp, and a roundabout.Incorporating these information-dense observations reduces training times tounder one hour on a single CPU, and the evaluation results reveal that our RLagents can effectively zero-shot generalize.

In an orthogonal direction, we present a simple yeteffective method to expand the training data by interpolating betweeninstance-level feature statistics across labeled and unlabeled sets. Ourmethod, dubbed Targeted Style Adversary (TSA), is motivated by twoobservations: (i) the input domain is reflected in feature statistics, and (ii)face recognition model performance is influenced by style information. Shiftingtowards an unlabeled style implicitly synthesizes challenging traininginstances. We devise a recognizability metric to constraint our framework topreserve the inherent identity-related information of labeled instances.

However, most current datapruning algorithms are limited in their ability to preserve accuracy comparedto models trained on the full data, especially in high pruning regimes. In thispaper we explore the application of data pruning while incorporating knowledgedistillation (KD) when training on a pruned subset. That is, rather thanrelying solely on ground-truth labels, we also use the soft predictions from ateacher network pre-trained on the complete data. By integrating KD intotraining, we demonstrate significant improvement across datasets, pruningmethods, and on all pruning fractions. We first establish a theoreticalmotivation for employing self-distillation to improve training on pruned data.Then, we empirically make a compelling and highly practical observation: usingKD, simple random pruning is comparable or superior to sophisticated pruningmethods across all pruning regimes. On ImageNet for example, we achievesuperior accuracy despite training on a random subset of only 50% of the data.Additionally, we demonstrate a crucial connection between the pruning factorand the optimal knowledge distillation weight. This helps mitigate the impactof samples with noisy labels and low-quality images retained by typical pruningalgorithms. Finally, we make an intriguing observation: when using lowerpruning fractions, larger teachers lead to accuracy degradation, whilesurprisingly, employing teachers with a smaller capacity than the student's mayimprove results.

This disparity suggests thatworking memory can organize information into compact representations such aschunks, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, wepropose a recurrent neural network model for chunking within the framework ofthe synaptic theory of working memory. We showed that by selectivelysuppressing groups of stimuli, the network can maintain and retrieve thestimuli in chunks, hence exceeding the basic capacity. Moreover, we show thatour model can dynamically construct hierarchical representations within workingmemory through hierarchical chunking. A consequence of this proposed mechanismis a new limit on the number of items that can be stored and subsequentlyretrieved from working memory, depending only on the basic working memorycapacity when chunking is not invoked.

One of such risks is that of perpetuating or even amplifyingbias and unjust disparities present in the data from which many of thesesystems learn to adjust and optimise their decisions. This awareness has on theone hand encouraged several scientific communities to come up with more andmore appropriate ways and methods to assess, quantify, and possibly mitigatesuch biases and disparities. On the other hand, it has prompted more and morelayers of society, including policy makers, to call for fair algorithms. Webelieve that while many excellent and multidisciplinary research is currentlybeing conducted, what is still fundamentally missing is the awareness thathaving fair algorithms is per se a nearly meaningless requirement that needs tobe complemented with many additional social choices to become actionable.Namely, there is a hiatus between what the society is demanding from AutomatedDecision-Making systems, and what this demand actually means in real-worldscenarios. In this work, we outline the key features of such a hiatus andpinpoint a set of crucial open points that we as a society must address inorder to give a concrete meaning to the increasing demand of fairness inAutomated Decision-Making systems.</description><author>Daniele Regoli, Alessandro Castelnovo, Nicole Inverardi, Gabriele Nanino, Ilaria Penco</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 16:01:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12435v3</guid></item><item><title>Drug Discovery SMILES-to-Pharmacokinetics Diffusion Models with Deep Molecular Understanding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07636v1</link><description>Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in every stage of drugdevelopment.

Most previous low-rank network compressionmethods compress networks by approximating pre-trained models and re-training.However, the optimal solution in the Euclidean space may be quite differentfrom the one with low-rank constraint. A well-pre-trained model is not a goodinitialization for the model with low-rank constraints. Thus, the performanceof a low-rank compressed network degrades significantly. Compared with othernetwork compression methods such as pruning, low-rank methods attract lessattention in recent years. In this paper, we devise a new training method,low-rank projection with energy transfer (LRPET), that trains low-rankcompressed networks from scratch and achieves competitive performance. Wepropose to alternately perform stochastic gradient descent training andprojection of each weight matrix onto the corresponding low-rank manifold.Compared to re-training on the compact model, this enables full utilization ofmodel capacity since solution space is relaxed back to Euclidean space afterprojection. The matrix energy (the sum of squares of singular values) reductioncaused by projection is compensated by energy transfer. We uniformly transferthe energy of the pruned singular values to the remaining ones. Wetheoretically show that energy transfer eases the trend of gradient vanishingcaused by projection. In modern networks, a batch normalization (BN) layer canbe merged into the previous convolution layer for inference, therebyinfluencing the optimal low-rank approximation of the previous layer. Wepropose BN rectification to cut off its effect on the optimal low-rankapproximation, which further improves the performance.</description><author>Kailing Guo, Zhenquan Lin, Canyang Chen, Xiaofen Xing, Fang Liu, Xiangmin Xu</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 15:31:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05566v3</guid></item><item><title>Rethinking the Key Factors for the Generalization of Remote Sensing Stereo Matching Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07613v1</link><description>Stereo matching, a critical step of 3D reconstruction, has fully shiftedtowards deep learning due to its strong feature representation of remotesensing images. However, ground truth for stereo matching task relies onexpensive airborne LiDAR data, thus making it difficult to obtain enoughsamples for supervised learning. To improve the generalization ability ofstereo matching networks on cross-domain data from different sensors andscenarios, in this paper, we dedicate to study key training factors from threeperspectives. (1) For the selection of training dataset, it is important toselect data with similar regional target distribution as the test set insteadof utilizing data from the same sensor. (2) For model structure, cascadedstructure that flexibly adapts to different sizes of features is preferred. (3)For training manner, unsupervised methods generalize better than supervisedmethods, and we design an unsupervised early-stop strategy to help retain thebest model with pre-trained weights as the basis. Extensive experiments areconducted to support the previous findings, on the basis of which we present anunsupervised stereo matching network with good generalization performance.

However, LLMs are prone to producefactually incorrect information and often produce "phantom" content thatundermines their reliability, which poses a serious challenge for theirdeployment in real-world scenarios. Enhancing LLMs by combining externaldatabases and information retrieval mechanisms is an effective path. To addressthe above challenges, we propose a new approach called WeKnow-RAG, whichintegrates Web search and Knowledge Graphs into a "Retrieval-AugmentedGeneration (RAG)" system. First, the accuracy and reliability of LLM responsesare improved by combining the structured representation of Knowledge Graphswith the flexibility of dense vector retrieval. WeKnow-RAG then utilizesdomain-specific knowledge graphs to satisfy a variety of queries and domains,thereby improving performance on factual information and complex reasoningtasks by employing multi-stage web page retrieval techniques using both sparseand dense retrieval methods. Our approach effectively balances the efficiencyand accuracy of information retrieval, thus improving the overall retrievalprocess. Finally, we also integrate a self-assessment mechanism for the LLM toevaluate the trustworthiness of the answers it generates.

This has led to the development of numerousprompting strategies to adapt transformer-based models without incurringcatastrophic forgetting. However, these strategies often compromise theoriginal zero-shot capabilities of the pre-trained CLIP model and struggle toadapt to domains that significantly deviate from the pre-training data. In thiswork, we propose Continual Generative training for Incremental prompt-Learning,a simple and novel approach to mitigate forgetting while adapting CLIP.Briefly, we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn class-conditioneddistributions within the embedding space of the visual encoder. We then exploitthese distributions to sample new synthetic visual embeddings and train thecorresponding class-specific textual prompts during subsequent tasks. Throughextensive experiments on different domains, we show that such a generativereplay approach can adapt to new tasks while improving zero-shot capabilities,evaluated using a novel metric tailored for CL scenarios.

Taking multi-view images as input,our method starts from a pre-trained radiance field guidance, and distillsphysically-based light and material parameters from the radiance field using animage-fitting process. The distillation progress map is initialized to a smallvalue, which favors radiance field rendering. During early iterations whenfitted light and material parameters are far from convergence, the radiancefield fallback ensures the sanity of image loss gradients and avoids localminima that attracts under-fit states. As fitted parameters converge, thephysical model gradually takes over and the distillation progress increasescorrespondingly. In presence of light paths unmodeled by the physical model,the distillation progress never finishes on affected pixels and the learnedradiance field stays in the final rendering. With this designed tolerance forphysical model limitations, we prevent unmodeled color components from leakinginto light and material parameters, alleviating relighting artifacts.Meanwhile, the remaining radiance field compensates for the limitations of thephysical model, guaranteeing high-quality novel views synthesis. Experimentalresults demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-arttechniques quality-wise in both novel view synthesis and relighting. The ideaof progressive radiance distillation is not limited to Gaussian splatting. Weshow that it also has positive effects for prominently specular scenes whenadapted to a mesh-based inverse rendering method.</description><author>Keyang Ye, Qiming Hou, Kun Zhou</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 14:50:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07595v1</guid></item><item><title>Global Optimisation of Black-Box Functions with Generative Models in the Wasserstein Space</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11917v2</link><description>We propose a new uncertainty estimator for gradient-free optimisation ofblack-box simulators using deep generative surrogate models.

Increasing capacity improvesperformance until all the information from the dataset is captured. After thispoint, computational cost keeps increasing, without improved performance. Thisleads to the question ``How big is big enough?'' We investigate this problemfor Gaussian processes (single-layer neural networks) in continual learning.Here, data becomes available incrementally, and the final dataset size willtherefore not be known before training, preventing the use of heuristics forsetting the model size.

In this paper,we propose FedQUIT, a novel algorithm that uses knowledge distillation to scrubthe contribution of the forgetting data from an FL global model whilepreserving its generalization ability. FedQUIT directly works on clients'devices and does not require sharing additional information if compared with aregular FL process, nor does it assume the availability of publicly availableproxy data. Our solution is efficient, effective, and applicable in bothcentralized and federated settings.

The GCP asks for the minimum number of colors that can be assigned tothe vertices of a given graph such that each two adjacent vertices getdifferent colors. The BCP is a generalization, where each edge has a weightthat enforces a minimal "distance" between the assigned colors, and the goal isto minimize the "largest" color used. For the widely studied GCP, weexperimentally compare our new SAT encoding to the state-of-the-art approacheson the DIMACS benchmark set. Our evaluation confirms that this SAT encoding iseffective for sparse graphs and even outperforms the state-of-the-art on someDIMACS instances. For the BCP, our theoretical analysis shows that thepartial-ordering based SAT and ILP formulations have an asymptotically smallersize than that of the classical assignment-based model.

Unmixing is a fundamental process in hyperspectral image analysis,and is growing in importance as increasingly large spectral libraries arecreated and used. Unmixing is typically done with ordinary least squares (OLS)regression. However, unmixing with large spectral libraries where the materialspresent in a pixel are not a priori known, solving for the coefficients in OLSrequires inverting a non-invertible matrix from a large spectral library. Anumber of regression methods are available that can produce a numericalsolution using regularization, but with considerably varied effectiveness.Also, simple methods that are unpopular in the statistics literature (i.e.step-wise regression) are used with some level of effectiveness inhyperspectral analysis. In this paper, we provide a thorough performanceevaluation of the methods considered, evaluating methods based on how oftenthey select the correct materials in the models. Investigated methods includeordinary least squares regression, non-negative least squares regression, ridgeregression, lasso regression, step-wise regression and Bayesian modelaveraging. We evaluated these unmixing approaches using multiple criteria:incorporation of non-negative abundances, model size, accurate mineraldetection and root mean squared error (RMSE). We provide a taxonomy of theregression methods, showing that most methods can be understood as Bayesianmethods with specific priors. We conclude that methods that can be derived withpriors that correspond to the phenomenology of hyperspectral imagery outperformthose with priors that are optimal for prediction performance under theassumptions of ordinary least squares linear regression.</description><author>Jade Preston, William Basener</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 14:24:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07580v1</guid></item><item><title>TabularBench: Benchmarking Adversarial Robustness for Tabular Deep Learning in Real-world Use-cases</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07579v1</link><description>While adversarial robustness in computer vision is a mature research field,fewer researchers have tackled the evasion attacks against tabular deeplearning, and even fewer investigated robustification mechanisms and reliabledefenses.

However, in large-scalemixed platoons, vehicle heterogeneity and unpredictable traffic conditions leadto virtual bottlenecks. These bottlenecks result in reduced traffic throughputand increased energy consumption within the platoon. To address thesechallenges, we introduce a decision-making strategy based on nested graphreinforcement learning. This strategy improves collaborative decision-making,ensuring energy efficiency and alleviating congestion. We propose a theory ofnested traffic graph representation that maps dynamic interactions betweenvehicles and platoons in non-Euclidean spaces. By incorporating spatio-temporalweighted graph into a multi-head attention mechanism, we further enhance themodel's capacity to process both local and global data. Additionally, we havedeveloped a nested graph reinforcement learning framework to enhance theself-iterative learning capabilities of platooning.

Previous studies have exploited itonly for the backbone network. Unlike previous studies, we explore the capacityof the Metaformer architecture more extensively in the semantic segmentationtask. We propose a powerful semantic segmentation network, MetaSeg, whichleverages the Metaformer architecture from the backbone to the decoder. OurMetaSeg shows that the MetaFormer architecture plays a significant role incapturing the useful contexts for the decoder as well as for the backbone. Inaddition, recent segmentation methods have shown that using a CNN-basedbackbone for extracting the spatial information and a decoder for extractingthe global information is more effective than using a transformer-basedbackbone with a CNN-based decoder. This motivates us to adopt the CNN-basedbackbone using the MetaFormer block and design our MetaFormer-based decoder,which consists of a novel self-attention module to capture the global contexts.To consider both the global contexts extraction and the computationalefficiency of the self-attention for semantic segmentation, we propose aChannel Reduction Attention (CRA) module that reduces the channel dimension ofthe query and key into the one dimension. In this way, our proposed MetaSegoutperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods with more efficientcomputational costs on popular semantic segmentation and a medical imagesegmentation benchmark, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-stuff, and Synapse.The code is available at \url{https://github.com/hyunwoo137/MetaSeg}.</description><author>Beoungwoo Kang, Seunghun Moon, Yubin Cho, Hyunwoo Yu, Suk-Ju Kang</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 14:16:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07576v1</guid></item><item><title>A General Framework for Constraint-based Causal Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07575v1</link><description>By representing any constraint-based causal learning algorithm via aplaceholder property, we decompose the correctness condition into a partrelating the distribution and the true causal graph, and a part that dependssolely on the distribution.

Although significant advances have been made byregularizing the information in representations with information theory, twomajor challenges remain: 1) the representation compression inevitably leads toperformance drop; 2) the disentanglement constraints on representations are incomplicated optimization. To these issues, we introduce Bayesian networks withtransmitted information to formulate the interaction among input andrepresentations during disentanglement.

Since theEHRs contain enriched information specifying complex interactions betweenentities, modeling EHRs with graphs is shown to be effective in practice. TheEHRs, however, present a great degree of heterogeneity, sparsity, andcomplexity, which hamper the performance of most of the models applied to them.Moreover, existing approaches modeling EHRs often focus on learning therepresentations for a single task, overlooking the multi-task nature of EHRanalysis problems and resulting in limited generalizability across differenttasks. In view of these limitations, we propose a novel framework for EHRmodeling, namely MulT-EHR (Multi-Task EHR), which leverages a heterogeneousgraph to mine the complex relations and model the heterogeneity in the EHRs. Tomitigate the large degree of noise, we introduce a denoising module based onthe causal inference framework to adjust for severe confounding effects andreduce noise in the EHR data. Additionally, since our model adopts a singlegraph neural network for simultaneous multi-task prediction, we design amulti-task learning module to leverage the inter-task knowledge to regularizethe training process. Extensive empirical studies on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IVdatasets validate that the proposed method consistently outperforms thestate-of-the-art designs in four popular EHR analysis tasks -- drugrecommendation, and predictions of the length of stay, mortality, andreadmission.

GS-Pose begins with a set of posed RGBimages of a previously unseen object and builds three distinct representationsstored in a database. At inference, GS-Pose operates sequentially by locatingthe object in the input image, estimating its initial 6D pose using a retrievalapproach, and refining the pose with a render-and-compare method. The keyinsight is the application of the appropriate object representation at eachstage of the process. In particular, for the refinement step, we leverage 3DGaussian splatting, a novel differentiable rendering technique that offers highrendering speed and relatively low optimization time.

Among these, edge-case attacks that target asmall fraction of the input space are nearly impossible to detect usingexisting defenses, leading to a high attack success rate. We propose aneffective defense using an external defense dataset, which provides informationabout the attack target. The defense dataset contains a mix of poisoned andclean examples, with only a few known to be clean. The proposed method,DataDefense, uses this dataset to learn a poisoned data detector model whichmarks each example in the defense dataset as poisoned or clean. It also learnsa client importance model that estimates the probability of a client updatebeing malicious. The global model is then updated as a weighted average of theclient models' updates. The poisoned data detector and the client importancemodel parameters are updated using an alternating minimization strategy overthe Federated Learning rounds. Extensive experiments on standard attackscenarios demonstrate that DataDefense can defend against model poisoningattacks where other state-of-the-art defenses fail. In particular, DataDefenseis able to reduce the attack success rate by at least ~ 40% on standard attacksetups and by more than 80% on some setups.

Although GAN-basedmethods have shown their strength in fast waveform generation, they arevulnerable to train-inference mismatch scenarios such as two-stagetext-to-speech. Meanwhile, diffusion-based models have shown their powerfulgenerative performance in other domains; however, they stay out of thelimelight due to slow inference speed in waveform generation tasks. Above all,there is no generator architecture that can explicitly disentangle the naturalperiodic features of high-resolution waveform signals. In this paper, wepropose PeriodWave, a novel universal waveform generation model. First, weintroduce a period-aware flow matching estimator that can capture the periodicfeatures of the waveform signal when estimating the vector fields.Additionally, we utilize a multi-period estimator that avoids overlaps tocapture different periodic features of waveform signals. Although increasingthe number of periods can improve the performance significantly, this requiresmore computational costs. To reduce this issue, we also propose a singleperiod-conditional universal estimator that can feed-forward parallel byperiod-wise batch inference. Additionally, we utilize discrete wavelettransform to losslessly disentangle the frequency information of waveformsignals for high-frequency modeling, and introduce FreeU to reduce thehigh-frequency noise for waveform generation. The experimental resultsdemonstrated that our model outperforms the previous models both inMel-spectrogram reconstruction and text-to-speech tasks.

Research identifies several problems, including low quality or absentteacher lesson planning. As the government pushes towards the implementation ofa new curriculum, exiting lesson plans become obsolete and the problem isworsened. Using a Retrieval Augmented Generation approach, we developed aprototype that generates customized lesson plans based on thegovernment-accredited textbooks. This helps teachers create lesson plans moreefficiently and with better quality, ensuring they are fully aligned the newcurriculum and the competence-based learning approach. Methods: The prototype was created using Cohere LLM and Sentence Embeddings,and LangChain Framework - and thereafter made available on a public website.Vector stores were trained for three new curriculum textbooks (ICT,Mathematics, History), all at Secondary 1 Level. Twenty-four lessons plans weregenerated following a pseudo-random generation protocol, based on the suggestedperiods in the textbooks. The lesson plans were analyzed regarding theirtechnical quality by three independent raters following the Lesson PlanAnalysis Protocol (LPAP) by Ndihokubwayo et al. (2022) that is specificallydesigned for East Africa and competence-based curriculums. Results: Evaluation of 24 lesson plans using the LPAP resulted in an averagequality of between 75 and 80%, corresponding to "very good lesson plan". Noneof the lesson plans scored below 65%, although one lesson plan could be arguedto have been missing the topic. In conclusion, the quality of the generatedlesson plans is at least comparable, if not better, than those created byhumans, as demonstrated in a study in Rwanda, whereby no lesson plan evenreached the benchmark of 50%.</description><author>Simon Kloker, Herbertson Bukoli, Twaha Kateete</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 13:22:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07542v1</guid></item><item><title>DifuzCam: Replacing Camera Lens with a Mask and a Diffusion Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07541v1</link><description>The flat lensless camera design reduces the camera size and weightsignificantly.

Whileprevious works on editing have achieved interesting results throughmanipulating 3D meshes, they often require accurately reconstructed meshes toperform editing, which limits their application in 3D content generation. Toaddress this gap, we introduce a novel single-image-driven 3D scene editingapproach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling intuitive manipulation viadirectly editing the content on a 2D image plane. Our method learns to optimizethe 3D Gaussians to align with an edited version of the image rendered from auser-specified viewpoint of the original scene. To capture long-range objectdeformation, we introduce positional loss into the optimization process of 3DGaussian Splatting and enable gradient propagation through reparameterization.To handle occluded 3D Gaussians when rendering from the specified viewpoint, webuild an anchor-based structure and employ a coarse-to-fine optimizationstrategy capable of handling long-range deformation while maintainingstructural stability. Furthermore, we design a novel masking strategy toadaptively identify non-rigid deformation regions for fine-scale modeling.Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in handlinggeometric details, long-range, and non-rigid deformation, demonstratingsuperior editing flexibility and quality compared to previous approaches.</description><author>Guan Luo, Tian-Xing Xu, Ying-Tian Liu, Xiao-Xiong Fan, Fang-Lue Zhang, Song-Hai Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 13:17:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07540v1</guid></item><item><title>Cross-aware Early Fusion with Stage-divided Vision and Language Transformer Encoders for Referring Image Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07539v1</link><description>Referring segmentation aims to segment a target object related to a naturallanguage expression. Key challenges of this task are understanding the meaningof complex and ambiguous language expressions and determining the relevantregions in the image with multiple objects by referring to the expression.Recent models have focused on the early fusion with the language features atthe intermediate stage of the vision encoder, but these approaches have alimitation that the language features cannot refer to the visual information.To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel architecture, Cross-awareearly fusion with stage-divided Vision and Language Transformer encoders(CrossVLT), which allows both language and vision encoders to perform the earlyfusion for improving the ability of the cross-modal context modeling. Unlikeprevious methods, our method enables the vision and language features to referto each other's information at each stage to mutually enhance the robustness ofboth encoders. Furthermore, unlike the conventional scheme that relies solelyon the high-level features for the cross-modal alignment, we introduce afeature-based alignment scheme that enables the low-level to high-levelfeatures of the vision and language encoders to engage in the cross-modalalignment. By aligning the intermediate cross-modal features in all encoderstages, this scheme leads to effective cross-modal fusion. In this way, theproposed approach is simple but effective for referring image segmentation, andit outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on three publicbenchmarks.</description><author>Yubin Cho, Hyunwoo Yu, Suk-ju Kang</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 13:17:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07539v1</guid></item><item><title>Lost in Overlap: Exploring Watermark Collision in LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10020v2</link><description>The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in generating contentraises concerns about text copyright.

Widely usedstructure-from-motion pipelines encounter difficulties in accurately trackingthe camera trajectory when faced with separate dynamics of the scene contentand the camera movement. To address this challenge, we propose DynamicMotion-Aware Fast and Robust Camera Localization for Dynamic Neural RadianceFields (DynaMoN). DynaMoN utilizes semantic segmentation and generic motionmasks to handle dynamic content for initial camera pose estimation andstatics-focused ray sampling for fast and accurate novel-view synthesis. Ournovel iterative learning scheme switches between training the NeRF and updatingthe pose parameters for an improved reconstruction and trajectory estimationquality. The proposed pipeline shows significant acceleration of the trainingprocess. We extensively evaluate our approach on two real-world dynamicdatasets, the TUM RGB-D dataset and the BONN RGB-D Dynamic dataset. DynaMoNimproves over the state-of-the-art both in terms of reconstruction quality andtrajectory accuracy. We plan to make our code public to enhance research inthis area.</description><author>Nicolas Schischka, Hannah Schieber, Mert Asim Karaoglu, Melih Görgülü, Florian Grötzner, Alexander Ladikos, Daniel Roth, Nassir Navab, Benjamin Busam</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 13:09:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08927v3</guid></item><item><title>Volley Revolver: A Novel Matrix-Encoding Method for Privacy-Preserving Neural Networks (Inference)</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12577v5</link><description>In this work, we present a novel matrix-encoding method that is particularlyconvenient for neural networks to make predictions in a privacy-preservingmanner using homomorphic encryption. Based on this encoding method, weimplement a convolutional neural network for handwritten image classificationover encryption. For two matrices $A$ and $B$ to perform homomorphicmultiplication, the main idea behind it, in a simple version, is to encryptmatrix $A$ and the transpose of matrix $B$ into two ciphertexts respectively.With additional operations, the homomorphic matrix multiplication can becalculated over encrypted matrices efficiently. For the convolution operation,we in advance span each convolution kernel to a matrix space of the same sizeas the input image so as to generate several ciphertexts, each of which islater used together with the ciphertext encrypting input images for calculatingsome of the final convolution results. We accumulate all these intermediateresults and thus complete the convolution operation.

Yet existing methods for identifying information sharedamong groups of $d&gt;3$ variables are often intractable; asymmetric around atarget variable; or unable to consider all factorisations of the jointprobability distribution. Here, we present a framework that systematicallyderives high-order measures using lattice and operator function pairs, wherebythe lattice captures the algebraic relational structure of the variables andthe operator function computes measures over the lattice. We show that manyexisting information-theoretic high-order measures can be derived by usingdivergences as operator functions on sublattices of the partition lattice, thuspreventing the accurate quantification of all interactions for $d&gt;3$.Similarly, we show that using the KL divergence as the operator function alsoleads to unwanted cancellation of interactions for $d&gt;3$. To characterise allinteractions among $d$ variables, we introduce the Streitberg informationdefined on the full partition lattice using generalisations of the KLdivergence as operator functions. We validate our results numerically onsynthetic data, and illustrate the use of the Streitberg information throughapplications to stock market returns and neural electrophysiology data.</description><author>Zhaolu Liu, Mauricio Barahona, Robert L.

CMR typically acquires multiple sparse 2D slices, with unavoidablerespiratory motion artefacts between slices, whereas CT acquires isotropicdense data but uses ionising radiation. In this study, we explore thecombination of Slice Shifting Algorithm (SSA), Spatial Transformer Network(STN), and Label Transformer Network (LTN) to: 1) correct respiratory motionbetween segmented slices, and 2) transform sparse segmentation data into densesegmentation. All combinations were validated using synthetic motion-corruptedCMR slice segmentation generated from CT in 1699 cases, where the dense CTserves as the ground truth. In 199 testing cases, SSA-LTN achieved the bestresults for Dice score and Huasdorff distance (94.0% and 4.7 mm respectively,average over 5 labels) but gave topological errors in 8 cases. STN waseffective as a plug-in tool for correcting all topological errors with minimalimpact on overall performance (93.5% and 5.0 mm respectively). SSA also provesto be a valuable plug-in tool, enhancing performance over both STN-based andLTN-based models.

While clinical decision support systems (CDSS)have shown promise, the integration of large language models (LLMs) offers newpossibilities for enhancing triage accuracy and clinical decision-making. Thisstudy presents an LLM-driven CDSS designed to assist ED physicians and nursesin patient triage, treatment planning, and overall emergency care management. We developed a multi-agent CDSS utilizing Llama-3-70b as the base LLM,orchestrated by CrewAI and Langchain. The system comprises four AI agentsemulating key ED roles: Triage Nurse, Emergency Physician, Pharmacist, and EDCoordinator. It incorporates the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS) fortriage assessment and integrates with the RxNorm API for medication management. The model was evaluated using the Asclepius dataset, with performanceassessed by a clinical emergency medicine specialist. The CDSS demonstratedhigh accuracy in triage decision-making compared to the baseline of asingle-agent system. Furthermore, the system exhibited strong performance incritical areas, including primary diagnosis, critical findings identification,disposition decision-making, treatment planning, and resource allocation. Our multi-agent CDSS demonstrates significant potential for supportingcomprehensive emergency care management.

The fastevolving mobile devices and existing high-performance video SCI reconstructionalgorithms motivate us to develop mobile reconstruction methods for real-worldapplications. Yet, it is still challenging to deploy previous reconstructionalgorithms on mobile devices due to the complex inference process, let alonereal-time mobile reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, there is novideo SCI reconstruction model designed to run on the mobile devices. Towardsthis end, in this paper, we present an effective approach for video SCIreconstruction, dubbed MobileSCI, which can run at real-time speed on themobile devices for the first time. Specifically, we first build a U-shaped 2Dconvolution-based architecture, which is much more efficient andmobile-friendly than previous state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. Besides,an efficient feature mixing block, based on the channel splitting and shufflingmechanisms, is introduced as a novel bottleneck block of our proposed MobileSCIto alleviate the computational burden. Finally, a customized knowledgedistillation strategy is utilized to further improve the reconstructionquality. Extensive results on both simulated and real data show that ourproposed MobileSCI can achieve superior reconstruction quality with highefficiency on the mobile devices. Particularly, we can reconstruct a 256 X 256X 8 snapshot compressed measurement with real-time performance (about 35 FPS)on an iPhone 15.

Compared to existing DA scenarios, SF-BTDAgenerally faces the co-existence of different label shifts in differenttargets, along with noisy target pseudo labels generated from the source model.In this paper, we propose a new method called Evidential Contrastive Alignment(ECA) to decouple the blending target domain and alleviate the effect fromnoisy target pseudo labels. First, to improve the quality of pseudo targetlabels, we propose a calibrated evidential learning module to iterativelyimprove both the accuracy and certainty of the resulting model and adaptivelygenerate high-quality pseudo target labels. Second, we design a graphcontrastive learning with the domain distance matrix and confidence-uncertaintycriterion, to minimize the distribution gap of samples of a same class in theblended target domains, which alleviates the co-existence of different labelshifts in blended targets. We conduct a new benchmark based on three standardDA datasets and ECA outperforms other methods with considerable gains andachieves comparable results compared with those that have domain labels orsource data in prior.</description><author>Juepeng Zheng, Yibin Wen, Jinxiao Zhang, Runmin Dong, Haohuan Fu</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 13:02:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07527v1</guid></item><item><title>Causal modelling without introducing counterfactuals or abstract distributions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17385v2</link><description>The most common approach to causal modelling is the potential outcomesframework due to Neyman and Rubin. In this framework, outcomes ofcounterfactual treatments are assumed to be well-defined. This metaphysicalassumption is often thought to be problematic yet indispensable. Theconventional approach relies not only on counterfactuals but also on abstractnotions of distributions and assumptions of independence that are not directlytestable. In this paper, we construe causal inference as treatment-wisepredictions for finite populations where all assumptions are testable; thismeans that one can not only test predictions themselves (without anyfundamental problem) but also investigate sources of error when they fail. Thenew framework highlights the model-dependence of causal claims as well as thedifference between statistical and scientific inference.</description><author>Benedikt Höltgen, Robert C.

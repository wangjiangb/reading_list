However,the predominant focus remains on developing their capabilities in static imageunderstanding. The potential of MLLMs in processing sequential visual data isstill insufficiently explored, highlighting the absence of a comprehensive,high-quality assessment of their performance. In this paper, we introduceVideo-MME, the first-ever full-spectrum, Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark ofMLLMs in Video analysis. Our work distinguishes from existing benchmarksthrough four key features: 1) Diversity in video types, spanning 6 primaryvisual domains with 30 subfields to ensure broad scenario generalizability; 2)Duration in temporal dimension, encompassing both short-, medium-, andlong-term videos, ranging from 11 seconds to 1 hour, for robust contextualdynamics; 3) Breadth in data modalities, integrating multi-modal inputs besidesvideo frames, including subtitles and audios, to unveil the all-roundcapabilities of MLLMs; 4) Quality in annotations, utilizing rigorous manuallabeling by expert annotators to facilitate precise and reliable modelassessment. 900 videos with a total of 256 hours are manually selected andannotated by repeatedly viewing all the video content, resulting in 2,700question-answer pairs. With Video-MME, we extensively evaluate variousstate-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4 series and Gemini 1.5 Pro, as well asopen-source image models like InternVL-Chat-V1.5 and video models likeLLaVA-NeXT-Video. Our experiments reveal that Gemini 1.5 Pro is thebest-performing commercial model, significantly outperforming the open-sourcemodels. Our dataset along with these findings underscores the need for furtherimprovements in handling longer sequences and multi-modal data.

We propose two private variants of the non-parametric bootstrap, whichprivately compute the median of the results of multiple "little" bootstraps runon partitions of the data and give asymptotic bounds on the coverage error ofthe resulting confidence intervals. For a fixed differential privacy parameter$\epsilon$, our methods enjoy the same error rates as that of the non-privatebootstrap to within logarithmic factors in the sample size $n$. We empiricallyvalidate the performance of our methods for mean estimation, median estimation,and logistic regression with both real and synthetic data. Our methods achievesimilar coverage accuracy to existing methods (and non-private baselines) whileproviding notably shorter ($\gtrsim 10$ times) confidence intervals thanprevious approaches.</description><author>Karan Chadha, John Duchi, Rohith Kuditipudi</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:59:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07131v2</guid></item><item><title>Latent Intrinsics Emerge from Training to Relight</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21074v1</link><description>Image relighting is the task of showing what a scene from a source imagewould look like if illuminated differently. Inverse graphics schemes recover anexplicit representation of geometry and a set of chosen intrinsics, thenrelight with some form of renderer. However error control for inverse graphicsis difficult, and inverse graphics methods can represent only the effects ofthe chosen intrinsics. This paper describes a relighting method that isentirely data-driven, where intrinsics and lighting are each represented aslatent variables. Our approach produces SOTA relightings of real scenes, asmeasured by standard metrics. We show that albedo can be recovered from ourlatent intrinsics without using any example albedos, and that the albedosrecovered are competitive with SOTA methods.</description><author>Xiao Zhang, William Gao, Seemandhar Jain, Michael Maire, David.

Despite this, we find CLIP pre-trained thereupon exhibits notablerobustness to the data imbalance compared to supervised learning, anddemonstrates significant effectiveness in learning generalizablerepresentations. With an aim to investigate the reasons behind this finding, weconduct controlled experiments to study various underlying factors, and revealthat CLIP's pretext task forms a dynamic classification problem wherein only asubset of classes is present in training. This isolates the bias from dominantclasses and implicitly balances the learning signal. Furthermore, therobustness and discriminability of CLIP improve with more descriptive languagesupervision, larger data scale, and broader open-world concepts, which areinaccessible to supervised learning. Our study not only uncovers the mechanismsbehind CLIP's generalizability beyond data imbalance but also providestransferable insights for the research community. The findings are validated inboth supervised and self-supervised learning, enabling models trained onimbalanced data to achieve CLIP-level performance on diverse recognition tasks.Code will be available at: https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/clip-beyond-tail.</description><author>Xin Wen, Bingchen Zhao, Yilun Chen, Jiangmiao Pang, Xiaojuan Qi</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:57:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21070v1</guid></item><item><title>Code Pretraining Improves Entity Tracking Abilities of Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21068v1</link><description>Recent work has provided indirect evidence that pretraining language modelson code improves the ability of models to track state changes of discourseentities expressed in natural language. In this work, we systematically testthis claim by comparing pairs of language models on their entity trackingperformance. Critically, the pairs consist of base models and models trained ontop of these base models with additional code data. We extend this analysis toadditionally examine the effect of math training, another highly structureddata type, and alignment tuning, an important step for enhancing the usabilityof models. We find clear evidence that models additionally trained on largeamounts of code outperform the base models. On the other hand, we find noconsistent benefit of additional math training or alignment tuning acrossvarious model families.</description><author>Najoung Kim, Sebastian Schuster, Shubham Toshniwal</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:56:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21068v1</guid></item><item><title>Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752v2</link><description>Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deeplearning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and itscore attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linearattention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state spacemodels (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computationalinefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well asattention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a keyweakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning,and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters befunctions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities,allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along thesequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even thoughthis change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design ahardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate theseselective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture withoutattention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\times$higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, andits performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As ageneral sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performanceacross several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On languagemodeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size andmatches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstreamevaluation.</description><author>Albert Gu, Tri Dao</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:55:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752v2</guid></item><item><title>Mixed Diffusion for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21066v1</link><description>Realistic conditional 3D scene synthesis significantly enhances andaccelerates the creation of virtual environments, which can also provideextensive training data for computer vision and robotics research among otherapplications. Diffusion models have shown great performance in relatedapplications, e.g., making precise arrangements of unordered sets. However,these models have not been fully explored in floor-conditioned scene synthesisproblems. We present MiDiffusion, a novel mixed discrete-continuous diffusionmodel architecture, designed to synthesize plausible 3D indoor scenes fromgiven room types, floor plans, and potentially pre-existing objects. Werepresent a scene layout by a 2D floor plan and a set of objects, each definedby its category, location, size, and orientation. Our approach uniquelyimplements structured corruption across the mixed discrete semantic andcontinuous geometric domains, resulting in a better conditioned problem for thereverse denoising step. We evaluate our approach on the 3D-FRONT dataset. Ourexperimental results demonstrate that MiDiffusion substantially outperformsstate-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion models in floor-conditioned 3Dscene synthesis. In addition, our models can handle partial object constraintsvia a corruption-and-masking strategy without task specific training. We showMiDiffusion maintains clear advantages over existing approaches in scenecompletion and furniture arrangement experiments.</description><author>Siyi Hu, Diego Martin Arroyo, Stephanie Debats, Fabian Manhardt, Luca Carlone, Federico Tombari</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:54:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21066v1</guid></item><item><title>Recurrent neural networks: vanishing and exploding gradients are not the end of the story</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21064v1</link><description>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) notoriously struggle to learn long-termmemories, primarily due to vanishing and exploding gradients. The recentsuccess of state-space models (SSMs), a subclass of RNNs, to overcome suchdifficulties challenges our theoretical understanding. In this paper, we delveinto the optimization challenges of RNNs and discover that, as the memory of anetwork increases, changes in its parameters result in increasingly largeoutput variations, making gradient-based learning highly sensitive, evenwithout exploding gradients. Our analysis further reveals the importance of theelement-wise recurrence design pattern combined with careful parametrizationsin mitigating this effect. This feature is present in SSMs, as well as in otherarchitectures, such as LSTMs. Overall, our insights provide a new explanationfor some of the difficulties in gradient-based learning of RNNs and why somearchitectures perform better than others.</description><author>Nicolas Zucchet, Antonio Orvieto</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:53:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21064v1</guid></item><item><title>Neural Network Verification with Branch-and-Bound for General Nonlinearities</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21063v1</link><description>Branch-and-bound (BaB) is among the most effective methods for neural network(NN) verification. However, existing works on BaB have mostly focused on NNswith piecewise linear activations, especially ReLU networks. In this paper, wedevelop a general framework, named GenBaB, to conduct BaB for generalnonlinearities in general computational graphs based on linear boundpropagation. To decide which neuron to branch, we design a new branchingheuristic which leverages linear bounds as shortcuts to efficiently estimatethe potential improvement after branching. To decide nontrivial branchingpoints for general nonlinear functions, we propose to optimize branching pointsoffline, which can be efficiently leveraged during verification with a lookuptable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our GenBaB on verifying a wide rangeof NNs, including networks with activation functions such as Sigmoid, Tanh,Sine and GeLU, as well as networks involving multi-dimensional nonlinearoperations such as multiplications in LSTMs and Vision Transformers. Ourframework also allows the verification of general nonlinear computation graphsand enables verification applications beyond simple neural networks,particularly for AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). GenBaB is part of the latest$\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN, the winner of the 4th International Verification ofNeural Networks Competition (VNN-COMP 2023).</description><author>Zhouxing Shi, Qirui Jin, Zico Kolter, Suman Jana, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Huan Zhang</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:51:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21063v1</guid></item><item><title>Graph External Attention Enhanced Transformer</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21061v1</link><description>The Transformer architecture has recently gained considerable attention inthe field of graph representation learning, as it naturally overcomes severallimitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with customized attentionmechanisms or positional and structural encodings. Despite making someprogress, existing works tend to overlook external information of graphs,specifically the correlation between graphs. Intuitively, graphs with similarstructures should have similar representations. Therefore, we propose GraphExternal Attention (GEA) -- a novel attention mechanism that leverages multipleexternal node/edge key-value units to capture inter-graph correlationsimplicitly. On this basis, we design an effective architecture called GraphExternal Attention Enhanced Transformer (GEAET), which integrates localstructure and global interaction information for more comprehensive graphrepresentations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate thatGEAET achieves state-of-the-art empirical performance.

However, the Pseudo-LPIPS loss used in DDDM leads toconcerns about the bias in assessment. Here, we propose a unified DDDM (uDDDM)framework that generates images in one-step/multiple steps for both VariancePreserving (VP) and Variance Exploding (VE) cases. We provide theoreticalproofs of the existence and uniqueness of the model's solution paths, as wellas the non-intersecting property of the sampling paths. Additionally, wepropose an adaptive Pseudo-Huber loss function to balance the convergence tothe true solution and the stability of convergence process.Through acomprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that uDDDMs achieve FID scorescomparable to the best-performing methods available for CIFAR-10 in both VP andVE. Specifically, uDDDM achieves one-step generation on CIFAR10 with FID of2.63 and 2.53 for VE and VP respectively. By extending the sampling to 1000steps, we further reduce FID score to 1.71 and 1.65 for VE and VP respectively,setting state-of-the-art performance in both cases.</description><author>Jingjing Wang, Dan Zhang, Feng Luo</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:49:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21059v1</guid></item><item><title>Generalization or Memorization: Data Contamination and Trustworthy Evaluation for Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15938v3</link><description>Recent statements about the impressive capabilities of large language models(LLMs) are usually supported by evaluating on open-access benchmarks.Considering the vast size and wide-ranging sources of LLMs' training data, itcould explicitly or implicitly include test data, leading to LLMs being moresusceptible to data contamination. However, due to the opacity of trainingdata, the black-box access of models, and the rapid growth of synthetictraining data, detecting and mitigating data contamination for LLMs facessignificant challenges. In this paper, we propose CDD, which stands forContamination Detection via output Distribution for LLMs. CDD necessitates onlythe sampled texts to detect data contamination, by identifying the peakednessof LLM's output distribution. To mitigate the impact of data contamination inevaluation, we also present TED: Trustworthy Evaluation via outputDistribution, based on the correction of LLM's output distribution. Tofacilitate this study, we introduce two benchmarks, i.e., DetCon and ComiEval,for data contamination detection and contamination mitigation evaluation tasks.Extensive experimental results show that CDD achieves the average relativeimprovements of 21.8\%-30.2\% over other contamination detection approaches interms of Accuracy, F1 Score, and AUC metrics, and can effectively detectimplicit contamination.

In a decentralized setting,the two main challenges of personalization are client clustering and dataprivacy. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing P4(Personalized Private Peer-to-Peer) a method that ensures that each clientreceives a personalized model while maintaining differential privacy guaranteeof each client's local dataset during and after the training. Our approachincludes the design of a lightweight algorithm to identify similar clients andgroup them in a private, peer-to-peer (P2P) manner. Once grouped, we developdifferentially-private knowledge distillation for clients to co-train withminimal impact on accuracy. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmarkdatasets (FEMNIST or Federated EMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) and twodifferent neural network architectures (Linear and CNN-based networks) across arange of privacy parameters. The results demonstrate the potential of P4, as itoutperforms the state-of-the-art of differential private P2P by up to 40percent in terms of accuracy. We also show the practicality of P4 byimplementing it on resource constrained devices, and validating that it hasminimal overhead, e.g., about 7 seconds to run collaborative training betweentwo clients.</description><author>Mohammad Mahdi Maheri, Sandra Siby, Sina Abdollahi, Anastasia Borovykh, Hamed Haddadi</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:47:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17697v2</guid></item><item><title>SpeechVerse: A Large-scale Generalizable Audio Language Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08295v2</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have shown incredible proficiency in performingtasks that require semantic understanding of natural language instructions.Recently, many works have further expanded this capability to perceivemultimodal audio and text inputs, but their capabilities are often limited tospecific fine-tuned tasks such as automatic speech recognition and translation.We therefore develop SpeechVerse, a robust multi-task training and curriculumlearning framework that combines pre-trained speech and text foundation modelsvia a small set of learnable parameters, while keeping the pre-trained modelsfrozen during training.

Despite their successes, these models oftenexhibit limited diversity in the sampled images, particularly when samplingwith a high classifier-free guidance weight. To address this issue, we presentKaleido, a novel approach that enhances the diversity of samples byincorporating autoregressive latent priors. Kaleido integrates anautoregressive language model that encodes the original caption and generateslatent variables, serving as abstract and intermediary representations forguiding and facilitating the image generation process. In this paper, weexplore a variety of discrete latent representations, including textualdescriptions, detection bounding boxes, object blobs, and visual tokens. Theserepresentations diversify and enrich the input conditions to the diffusionmodels, enabling more diverse outputs. Our experimental results demonstratethat Kaleido effectively broadens the diversity of the generated image samplesfrom a given textual description while maintaining high image quality.Furthermore, we show that Kaleido adheres closely to the guidance provided bythe generated latent variables, demonstrating its capability to effectivelycontrol and direct the image generation process.</description><author>Jiatao Gu, Ying Shen, Shuangfei Zhai, Yizhe Zhang, Navdeep Jaitly, Joshua M.

Constrained decoding approaches mitigate this problem by greedilyrestricting what tokens an LLM can output at each step to guarantee that theoutput matches a given constraint. Specifically, in grammar-constraineddecoding (GCD), the LLM's output must follow a given grammar. In this paper wedemonstrate that GCD techniques (and in general constrained decodingtechniques) can distort the LLM's distribution, leading to outputs that aregrammatical but appear with likelihoods that are not proportional to the onesgiven by the LLM, and so ultimately are low-quality. We call the problem ofaligning sampling with a grammar constraint, grammar-aligned decoding (GAD),and propose adaptive sampling with approximate expected futures (ASAp), adecoding algorithm that guarantees the output to be grammatical while provablyproducing outputs that match the conditional probability of the LLM'sdistribution conditioned on the given grammar constraint. Our algorithm usesprior sample outputs to soundly overapproximate the future grammaticality ofdifferent output prefixes. Our evaluation on code generation and structured NLPtasks shows how ASAp often produces outputs with higher likelihood (accordingto the LLM's distribution) than existing GCD techniques, while still enforcingthe desired grammatical constraints.</description><author>Kanghee Park, Jiayu Wang, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Nadia Polikarpova, Loris D'Antoni</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:39:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21047v1</guid></item><item><title>Exploratory Preference Optimization: Harnessing Implicit Q*-Approximation for Sample-Efficient RLHF</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21046v1</link><description>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a centraltool for language model alignment. We consider online exploration in RLHF,which exploits interactive access to human or AI feedback by deliberatelyencouraging the model to produce diverse, maximally informative responses. Byallowing RLHF to confidently stray from the pre-trained model, onlineexploration offers the possibility of novel, potentially super-humancapabilities, but its full potential as a paradigm for language model traininghas yet to be realized, owing to computational and statistical bottlenecks indirectly adapting existing reinforcement learning techniques. We propose a newalgorithm for online exploration in RLHF, Exploratory Preference Optimization(XPO), which is simple and practical -- a one-line change to (online) DirectPreference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023) -- yet enjoys thestrongest known provable guarantees and promising empirical performance. XPOaugments the DPO objective with a novel and principled exploration bonus,empowering the algorithm to explore outside the support of the initial modeland human feedback data. In theory, we show that XPO is provablysample-efficient and converges to a near-optimal language model policy undernatural exploration conditions, irrespective of whether the initial model hasgood coverage. Our analysis, which builds on the observation that DPOimplicitly performs a form of $Q^{\star}$-approximation (or, Bellman errorminimization), combines previously disparate techniques from language modelingand theoretical reinforcement learning in a serendipitous fashion through theperspective of KL-regularized Markov decision processes. Empirically, we findthat XPO is more sample-efficient than non-exploratory DPO variants in apreliminary evaluation.</description><author>Tengyang Xie, Dylan J.

Whileinterest in studying LLM unlearning is growing,the impact of the optimizerchoice for LLM unlearning remains under-explored. In this work, we shed lighton the significance of optimizer selection in LLM unlearning for the firsttime, establishing a clear connection between {second-order optimization} andinfluence unlearning (a classical approach using influence functions to updatethe model for data influence removal). This insight propels us to develop asecond-order unlearning framework, termed SOUL, built upon the second-orderclipped stochastic optimization (Sophia)-based LLM training method. SOULextends the static, one-shot model update using influence unlearning to adynamic, iterative unlearning process. Our extensive experiments show that SOULconsistently outperforms conventional first-order methods across variousunlearning tasks, models, and metrics, suggesting the promise of second-orderoptimization in providing a scalable and easily implementable solution for LLMunlearning.</description><author>Jinghan Jia, Yihua Zhang, Yimeng Zhang, Jiancheng Liu, Bharat Runwal, James Diffenderfer, Bhavya Kailkhura, Sijia Liu</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:38:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18239v2</guid></item><item><title>An Attention-Based Multi-Context Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Neural Network for Work Zone Traffic Impact Prediction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21045v1</link><description>Work zone is one of the major causes of non-recurrent traffic congestion androad incidents.

In this paper, we propose adata integration pipeline that enhances the utilization of work zone andtraffic data from diversified platforms, and introduce a novel deep learningmodel to predict the traffic speed and incident likelihood during planned workzone events. The proposed model transforms traffic patterns into 2D space-timeimages for both model input and output and employs an attention-basedmulti-context convolutional encoder-decoder architecture to capture thespatial-temporal dependencies between work zone events and traffic variations.Trained and validated on four years of archived work zone traffic data fromMaryland, USA, the model demonstrates superior performance over baseline modelsin predicting traffic speed, incident likelihood, and inferred trafficattributes such as queue length and congestion timings (i.e., start time andduration). Specifically, the proposed model outperforms the baseline models byreducing the prediction error of traffic speed by 5% to 34%, queue length by11% to 29%, congestion timing by 6% to 17%, and increasing the accuracy ofincident predictions by 5% to 7%.

In practice thesefragments are representation (sub)spaces, often the set of channels in thelatent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE). Assessments of disentanglementpredominantly employ metrics that are coarse-grained at the model level, butthis approach can obscure much about the process of information fragmentation.Here we propose to study the learned channels in aggregate, as the fragments ofinformation learned by an ensemble of repeat training runs. Additionally, wedepart from prior work where measures of similarity between individualsubspaces neglected the nature of data embeddings as probability distributions.Instead, we view representation subspaces as communication channels thatperform a soft clustering of the data; consequently, we generalize two classicinformation-theoretic measures of similarity between clustering assignments tocompare representation spaces. We develop a lightweight method of estimationbased on fingerprinting representation subspaces by their ability todistinguish dataset samples, allowing us to identify, analyze, and leveragemeaningful structure in ensembles of VAEs trained on synthetic and naturaldatasets. Using this fully unsupervised pipeline we identify "hotspots" in thespace of information fragments: groups of nearly identical representationsubspaces that appear repeatedly in an ensemble of VAEs, particularly asregularization is increased. Finally, we leverage the proposed methodology toachieve ensemble learning with VAEs, boosting the information content of a setof weak learners -- a capability not possible with previous methods ofassessing channel similarity.</description><author>Kieran A.

However, DPOdoes not consider the relative qualities of the positive and negativeresponses, and can lead to sub-optimal training outcomes. To alleviate thisproblem, we investigate the use of intrinsic knowledge within the on-the-flyfine-tuning LLM to obtain relative qualities and help to refine the lossfunction. Specifically, we leverage the knowledge of the LLM to design arefinement function to estimate the quality of both the positive and negativeresponses. We show that the constructed refinement function can helpself-refine the loss function under mild assumptions. The refinement functionis integrated into DPO and its variant Identity Policy Optimization (IPO).Experiments across various evaluators indicate that they can improve theperformance of the fine-tuned models over DPO and IPO.</description><author>Runsheng Yu, Yong Wang, Xiaoqi Jiao, Youzhi Zhang, James T.

Most prior VQA studies, however, have merelyfocused on assessing the model's overall accuracy without evaluating it ondifferent reasoning cases. Furthermore, some recent works observe thatconventional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting fails to generate effectivereasoning for VQA, especially for complex scenarios requiring multi-hopreasoning. In this paper, we propose II-MMR, a novel idea to identify andimprove multi-modal multi-hop reasoning in VQA. In specific, II-MMR takes a VQAquestion with an image and finds a reasoning path to reach its answer using twonovel language promptings: (i) answer prediction-guided CoT prompt, or (ii)knowledge triplet-guided prompt. II-MMR then analyzes this path to identifydifferent reasoning cases in current VQA benchmarks by estimating how many hopsand what types (i.e., visual or beyond-visual) of reasoning are required toanswer the question. On popular benchmarks including GQA and A-OKVQA, II-MMRobserves that most of their VQA questions are easy to answer, simply demanding"single-hop" reasoning, whereas only a few questions require "multi-hop"reasoning. Moreover, while the recent V&amp;L model struggles with such complexmulti-hop reasoning questions even using the traditional CoT method, II-MMRshows its effectiveness across all reasoning cases in both zero-shot andfine-tuning settings.</description><author>Jihyung Kil, Farideh Tavazoee, Dongyeop Kang, Joo-Kyung Kim</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:30:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11058v2</guid></item><item><title>Introducing sgboost: A Practical Guide and Implementation of sparse-group boosting in R</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21037v1</link><description>This paper introduces the sgboost package in R, which implements sparse-groupboosting for modeling high-dimensional data with natural groupings incovariates.

However, this fieldcurrently lacks a unified theoretical foundation to underpin the study ofbelief in LLMs. This article begins filling this gap by proposing adequacyconditions for a representation in an LLM to count as belief-like. We arguethat, while the project of belief measurement in LLMs shares striking featureswith belief measurement as carried out in decision theory and formalepistemology, it also differs in ways that should change how we measure belief.Thus, drawing from insights in philosophy and contemporary practices of machinelearning, we establish four criteria that balance theoretical considerationswith practical constraints. Our proposed criteria include accuracy, coherence,uniformity, and use, which together help lay the groundwork for a comprehensiveunderstanding of belief representation in LLMs. We draw on empirical workshowing the limitations of using various criteria in isolation to identifybelief representations.</description><author>Daniel A.

We measure the performance of our method in terms ofsuboptimality and infeasibility errors and provide non-asymptotic convergenceguarantees for both error criteria.

Moreover,under the additional assumption that the lower-level objective satisfies the$r$-th H\"olderian error bound, we show that our method achieves an iterationcomplexity of$\mathcal{O}(\max\{\epsilon_{f}^{-\frac{2r-1}{2r}},\epsilon_{g}^{-\frac{2r-1}{2r}}\})$,which matches the optimal complexity of single-level convex constrainedoptimization when $r=1$.</description><author>Jincheng Cao, Ruichen Jiang, Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani, Aryan Mokhtari</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:20:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08097v2</guid></item><item><title>Collective Variable Free Transition Path Sampling with Generative Flow Network</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19961v2</link><description>Understanding transition paths between meta-stable states in molecularsystems is fundamental for material design and drug discovery.

This includes explicit confidencemarkers (e.g. giving a numeric score) as well as implicit markers, like anauthoritative tone or elaborating with additional knowledge. For LLMs to betrustworthy knowledge sources, the confidence they convey should match theiractual expertise; however, most current models tend towards overconfidence. Tocalibrate both implicit and explicit confidence markers, we introduce apragmatic, listener-aware finetuning method (LACIE) that models the listener,considering not only whether an answer is right, but whether it will beaccepted by a listener. We cast calibration as preference optimization,creating data via a two-agent game, where a speaker model's outputs are judgedby a simulated listener. We then finetune three LLMs (Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B,Llama3-70B) with LACIE, and show that the resulting models are bettercalibrated w.r.t. a simulated listener. Crucially, these trends transfer tohuman listeners, helping them correctly predict model correctness: we conduct ahuman evaluation where annotators accept or reject an LLM's answers, findingthat training with LACIE results in 47% fewer incorrect answers being acceptedwhile maintaining the same level of acceptance for correct answers.Furthermore, LACIE generalizes to another dataset, resulting in a largeincrease in truthfulness on TruthfulQA when trained on TriviaQA. Our analysisindicates that LACIE leads to a better confidence separation between correctand incorrect examples. Qualitatively, we find that a LACIE-trained modelhedges more and implicitly signals certainty when it is correct by using anauthoritative tone or including details. Finally, LACIE finetuning leads to anemergent increase in model abstention (e.g. saying "I don't know") for answersthat are likely wrong.</description><author>Elias Stengel-Eskin, Peter Hase, Mohit Bansal</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:16:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21028v1</guid></item><item><title>Fusion-PSRO: Nash Policy Fusion for Policy Space Response Oracles</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21027v1</link><description>For solving zero-sum games involving non-transitivity, a common approach isto maintain population policies to approximate the Nash Equilibrium (NE).Previous research has shown that the Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO) is aneffective multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for these games.However, repeatedly training new policies from scratch to approximate the BestResponse (BR) to opponents' mixed policies at each iteration is inefficient andcostly. While some PSRO methods initialize a new BR policy by inheriting frompast BR policies, this approach limits the exploration of new policies,especially against challenging opponents.To address this issue, we proposeFusion-PSRO, which uses model fusion to initialize the policy for betterapproximation to BR. With Top-k probabilities from NE, we select high-qualitybase policies and fuse them into a new BR policy through model averaging. Thisapproach allows the initialized policy to incorporate multiple expert policies,making it easier to handle difficult opponents compared to inheriting orinitializing from scratch. Additionally, our method only modifies the policyinitialization, enabling its application to nearly all PSRO variants withoutadditional training overhead.Our experiments with non-transitive matrix games,Leduc poker, and the more complex Liars Dice demonstrate that Fusion-PSROenhances the performance of nearly all PSRO variants, achieving lowerexploitability.</description><author>Jiesong Lian, Yucong Huang, Mingzhi Wang, Chengdong Ma, Yixue Hao, Ying Wen, Yaodong Yang</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:16:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21027v1</guid></item><item><title>Compact Optimality Verification for Optimization Proxies</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21023v1</link><description>Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in optimization proxies,i.e., machine learning models that approximate the input-output mapping ofparametric optimization problems and return near-optimal feasible solutions.Following recent work by (Nellikkath &amp; Chatzivasileiadis, 2021), this paperreconsiders the optimality verification problem for optimization proxies, i.e.,the determination of the worst-case optimality gap over the instancedistribution.

Manyred-teaming efforts aim to jailbreak LLMs, where among these efforts, theGreedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack's success has led to a growing interestin the study of optimization-based jailbreaking techniques. Although GCG is asignificant milestone, its attacking efficiency remains unsatisfactory. In thispaper, we present several improved (empirical) techniques foroptimization-based jailbreaks like GCG. We first observe that the single targettemplate of "Sure" largely limits the attacking performance of GCG; given this,we propose to apply diverse target templates containing harmful self-suggestionand/or guidance to mislead LLMs. Besides, from the optimization aspects, wepropose an automatic multi-coordinate updating strategy in GCG (i.e.,adaptively deciding how many tokens to replace in each step) to accelerateconvergence, as well as tricks like easy-to-hard initialisation. Then, wecombine these improved technologies to develop an efficient jailbreak method,dubbed $\mathcal{I}$-GCG. In our experiments, we evaluate on a series ofbenchmarks (such as NeurIPS 2023 Red Teaming Track).

Motivated by these practical considerations,we study an online variant of Fisher markets, wherein users with privatelyknown utility and budget parameters, drawn i.i.d. from a distribution, arrivesequentially. In this setting, we first study the limitations of static pricingalgorithms, which set uniform prices for all users, along two performancemetrics: (i) regret, i.e., the optimality gap in the objective of theEisenberg-Gale program between an online algorithm and an oracle with completeinformation, and (ii) capacity violations, i.e., the over-consumption of goodsrelative to their capacities. Given the limitations of static pricing, wedesign adaptive posted-pricing algorithms, one with knowledge of thedistribution of users' budget and utility parameters and another that adjustsprices solely based on past observations of user consumption, i.e., revealedpreference feedback, with improved performance guarantees.

Earlydetection of monkeypox lesions is crucial for effective treatment. However, dueto its similarity with other skin diseases, monkeypox lesion detection is achallenging task. To detect monkeypox, many researchers used variousdeep-learning models such as MobileNetv2, VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3,DenseNet121, EfficientNetB3, MobileNetV2, and Xception. However, these modelsoften require high storage space due to their large size. This study aims toimprove the existing challenges by introducing a CNN model named MpoxSLDNet(Monkeypox Skin Lesion Detector Network) to facilitate early detection andcategorization of Monkeypox lesions and Non-Monkeypox lesions in digitalimages. Our model represents a significant advancement in the field ofmonkeypox lesion detection by offering superior performance metrics, includingprecision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC, compared to traditionalpre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121. The key novelty ofour approach lies in MpoxSLDNet's ability to achieve high detection accuracywhile requiring significantly less storage space than existing models. Byaddressing the challenge of high storage requirements, MpoxSLDNet presents apractical solution for early detection and categorization of monkeypox lesionsin resource-constrained healthcare settings. In this study, we have used"Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset" comprising 1428 skin images of monkeypoxlesions and 1764 skin images of Non-Monkeypox lesions.

Learning from visual observations further exacerbates thisdifficulty. In this work, we explore highly data-driven approaches to visualwhole-body humanoid control based on reinforcement learning, without anysimplifying assumptions, reward design, or skill primitives. Specifically, wepropose a hierarchical world model in which a high-level agent generatescommands based on visual observations for a low-level agent to execute, both ofwhich are trained with rewards. Our approach produces highly performant controlpolicies in 8 tasks with a simulated 56-DoF humanoid, while synthesizingmotions that are broadly preferred by humans.

Despite the notable success, there is very limited literature thatprovides a theoretical tool for characterizing the behaviors of long-tailclasses in graphs and gaining insight into generalization performance inreal-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a generalization bound forlong-tail classification on graphs by formulating the problem in the fashion ofmulti-task learning, i.e., each task corresponds to the prediction of oneparticular class. Our theoretical results show that the generalizationperformance of long-tail classification is dominated by the overall loss rangeand the task complexity. Building upon the theoretical findings, we propose anovel generic framework HierTail for long-tail classification on graphs. Inparticular, we start with a hierarchical task grouping module that allows us toassign related tasks into hypertasks and thus control the complexity of thetask space; then, we further design a balanced contrastive learning module toadaptively balance the gradients of both head and tail classes to control theloss range across all tasks in a unified fashion. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate the effectiveness of HierTail in characterizing long-tail classeson real graphs, which achieves up to 12.9% improvement over the leadingbaseline method in accuracy.</description><author>Haohui Wang, Baoyu Jing, Kaize Ding, Yada Zhu, Wei Cheng, Si Zhang, Yonghui Fan, Liqing Zhang, Dawei Zhou</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 18:02:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09938v4</guid></item><item><title>TrojanRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Can Be Backdoor Driver in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13401v3</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about potential securitythreats despite performing significantly in Natural Language Processing (NLP).Backdoor attacks initially verified that LLM is doing substantial harm at allstages, but the cost and robustness have been criticized. Attacking LLMs isinherently risky in security review, while prohibitively expensive. Besides,the continuous iteration of LLMs will degrade the robustness of backdoors. Inthis paper, we propose TrojanRAG, which employs a joint backdoor attack in theRetrieval-Augmented Generation, thereby manipulating LLMs in universal attackscenarios. Specifically, the adversary constructs elaborate target contexts andtrigger sets. Multiple pairs of backdoor shortcuts are orthogonally optimizedby contrastive learning, thus constraining the triggering conditions to aparameter subspace to improve the matching. To improve the recall of the RAGfor the target contexts, we introduce a knowledge graph to construct structureddata to achieve hard matching at a fine-grained level. Moreover, we normalizethe backdoor scenarios in LLMs to analyze the real harm caused by backdoorsfrom both attackers' and users' perspectives and further verify whether thecontext is a favorable tool for jailbreaking models. Extensive experimentalresults on truthfulness, language understanding, and harmfulness show thatTrojanRAG exhibits versatility threats while maintaining retrieval capabilitieson normal queries.</description><author>Pengzhou Cheng, Yidong Ding, Tianjie Ju, Zongru Wu, Wei Du, Ping Yi, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 17:59:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13401v3</guid></item><item><title>Modeling User Preferences via Brain-Computer Interfacing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09691v2</link><description>Present Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) technology allows inference anddetection of cognitive and affective states, but fairly little has been done tostudy scenarios in which such information can facilitate new applications thatrely on modeling human cognition. One state that can be quantified from variousphysiological signals is attention. Estimates of human attention can be used toreveal preferences and novel dimensions of user experience. Previous approacheshave tackled these incredibly challenging tasks using a variety of behavioralsignals, from dwell-time to click-through data, and computational models ofvisual correspondence to these behavioral signals. However, behavioral signalsare only rough estimations of the real underlying attention and affectivepreferences of the users. Indeed, users may attend to some content simplybecause it is salient, but not because it is really interesting, or simplybecause it is outrageous. With this paper, we put forward a research agenda andexample work using BCI to infer users' preferences, their attentionalcorrelates towards visual content, and their associations with affectiveexperience. Subsequently, we link these to relevant applications, such asinformation retrieval, personalized steering of generative models, andcrowdsourcing population estimates of affective experiences.</description><author>Luis A.

Notably, both visual cues and linguistic symbolsin text-rich images play crucial roles in information transmission but areaccompanied by diverse challenges. Therefore, the efficient and effectiveunderstanding of text-rich images is a crucial litmus test for the capabilityof Vision-Language Models. We have crafted an efficient vision-language model,StrucTexTv3, tailored to tackle various intelligent tasks for text-rich images.The significant design of StrucTexTv3 is presented in the following aspects:Firstly, we adopt a combination of an effective multi-scale reduced visualtransformer and a multi-granularity token sampler (MG-Sampler) as a visualtoken generator, successfully solving the challenges of high-resolution inputand complex representation learning for text-rich images. Secondly, we enhancethe perception and comprehension abilities of StrucTexTv3 through instructionlearning, seamlessly integrating various text-oriented tasks into a unifiedframework. Thirdly, we have curated a comprehensive collection of high-qualitytext-rich images, abbreviated as TIM-30M, encompassing diverse scenarios likeincidental scenes, office documents, web pages, and screenshots, therebyimproving the robustness of our model. Our method achieved SOTA results intext-rich image perception tasks, and significantly improved performance incomprehension tasks. Among multimodal models with LLM decoder of approximately1.8B parameters, it stands out as a leader, which also makes the deployment ofedge devices feasible.

Inmost approaches, the system is considered a black box, making it difficult togenerate appropriate explanations. In this work, though, we consider a settingwhere models are transparent: probabilistic logic programming (PLP), a paradigmthat combines logic programming for knowledge representation and probability tomodel uncertainty. However, given a query, the usual notion of explanation isassociated with a set of choices, one for each random variable of the model.Unfortunately, such a set does not explain why the query is true and, in fact,it may contain choices that are actually irrelevant for the considered query.To improve this situation, we present in this paper an approach to explainingexplanations which is based on defining a new query-driven inference mechanismfor PLP where proofs are labeled with "choice expressions", a compact and easyto manipulate representation for sets of choices. The combination of prooftrees and choice expressions allows us to produce comprehensible queryjustifications with a causal structure.</description><author>Germán Vidal</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 17:45:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17045v3</guid></item><item><title>Explaining Predictions by Characteristic Rules</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21003v1</link><description>Characteristic rules have been advocated for their ability to improveinterpretability over discriminative rules within the area of rule learning.However, the former type of rule has not yet been used by techniques forexplaining predictions. A novel explanation technique, called CEGA(Characteristic Explanatory General Association rules), is proposed, whichemploys association rule mining to aggregate multiple explanations generated byany standard local explanation technique into a set of characteristic rules. Anempirical investigation is presented, in which CEGA is compared to twostate-of-the-art methods, Anchors and GLocalX, for producing local andaggregated explanations in the form of discriminative rules. The resultssuggest that the proposed approach provides a better trade-off between fidelityand complexity compared to the two state-of-the-art approaches; CEGA andAnchors significantly outperform GLocalX with respect to fidelity, while CEGAand GLocalX significantly outperform Anchors with respect to the number ofgenerated rules. The effect of changing the format of the explanations of CEGAto discriminative rules and using LIME and SHAP as local explanation techniquesinstead of Anchors are also investigated. The results show that thecharacteristic explanatory rules still compete favorably with rules in thestandard discriminative format. The results also indicate that using CEGA incombination with either SHAP or Anchors consistently leads to a higher fidelitycompared to using LIME as the local explanation technique.</description><author>Amr Alkhatib, Henrik Boström, Michalis Vazirgiannis</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 17:44:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21003v1</guid></item><item><title>URDFormer: A Pipeline for Constructing Articulated Simulation Environments from Real-World Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11656v3</link><description>Constructing simulation scenes that are both visually and physicallyrealistic is a problem of practical interest in domains ranging from roboticsto computer vision. This problem has become even more relevant as researcherswielding large data-hungry learning methods seek new sources of training datafor physical decision-making systems. However, building simulation models isoften still done by hand. A graphic designer and a simulation engineer workwith predefined assets to construct rich scenes with realistic dynamic andkinematic properties. While this may scale to small numbers of scenes, toachieve the generalization properties that are required for data-driven roboticcontrol, we require a pipeline that is able to synthesize large numbers ofrealistic scenes, complete with 'natural' kinematic and dynamic structures. Toattack this problem, we develop models for inferring structure and generatingsimulation scenes from natural images, allowing for scalable scene generationfrom web-scale datasets. To train these image-to-simulation models, we show howcontrollable text-to-image generative models can be used in generating pairedtraining data that allows for modeling of the inverse problem, mapping fromrealistic images back to complete scene models. We show how this paradigmallows us to build large datasets of scenes in simulation with semantic andphysical realism. We present an integrated end-to-end pipeline that generatessimulation scenes complete with articulated kinematic and dynamic structuresfrom real-world images and use these for training robotic control policies. Wethen robustly deploy in the real world for tasks like articulated objectmanipulation. In doing so, our work provides both a pipeline for large-scalegeneration of simulation environments and an integrated system for trainingrobust robotic control policies in the resulting environments.</description><author>Zoey Chen, Aaron Walsman, Marius Memmel, Kaichun Mo, Alex Fang, Karthikeya Vemuri, Alan Wu, Dieter Fox, Abhishek Gupta</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 17:44:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11656v3</guid></item><item><title>Towards a Fluid computer</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20999v1</link><description>In 1991, Moore [20] raised a question about whether hydrodynamics is capableof performing computations.

However, many real-worldproblems involve partial observations, formulated as partially observableMarkov decision processes (POMDPs). Previous studies have tackled RL in POMDPsby either incorporating the memory of past actions and observations or byinferring the true state of the environment from observed data. However,aggregating observed data over time becomes impractical in continuous spaces.Moreover, inference-based RL approaches often require many samples to performwell, as they focus solely on reward maximization and neglect uncertainty inthe inferred state. Active inference (AIF) is a framework formulated in POMDPsand directs agents to select actions by minimizing a function called expectedfree energy (EFE). This supplies reward-maximizing (exploitative) behaviour, asin RL, with information-seeking (exploratory) behaviour. Despite thisexploratory behaviour of AIF, its usage is limited to discrete spaces due tothe computational challenges associated with EFE. In this paper, we propose aunified principle that establishes a theoretical connection between AIF and RL,enabling seamless integration of these two approaches and overcoming theiraforementioned limitations in continuous space POMDP settings. We substantiateour findings with theoretical analysis, providing novel perspectives forutilizing AIF in the design of artificial agents. Experimental resultsdemonstrate the superior learning capabilities of our method in solvingcontinuous space partially observable tasks. Notably, our approach harnessesinformation-seeking exploration, enabling it to effectively solve reward-freeproblems and rendering explicit task reward design by an external supervisoroptional.</description><author>Parvin Malekzadeh, Konstantinos N.

Despite these advancements, LVLMs often exhibit thehallucination phenomenon, where generated text responses appear linguisticallyplausible but contradict the input image, indicating a misalignment betweenimage and text pairs. This misalignment arises because the model tends toprioritize textual information over visual input, even when both the languagemodel and visual representations are of high quality. Existing methods leverageadditional models or human annotations to curate preference data and enhancemodality alignment through preference optimization. These approaches may noteffectively reflect the target LVLM's preferences, making the curatedpreferences easily distinguishable. Our work addresses these challenges byproposing the Calibrated Self-Rewarding (CSR) approach, which enables the modelto self-improve by iteratively generating candidate responses, evaluating thereward for each response, and curating preference data for fine-tuning. In thereward modeling, we employ a step-wise strategy and incorporate visualconstraints into the self-rewarding process to place greater emphasis on visualinput. Empirical results demonstrate that CSR enhances performance and reduceshallucinations across ten benchmarks and tasks, achieving substantialimprovements over existing methods by 7.62%. Our empirical results are furthersupported by rigorous theoretical analysis, under mild assumptions, verifyingthe effectiveness of introducing visual constraints into the self-rewardingparadigm.

This in turn restricts how thesemodels are deployed -- for example it is unclear how to deploy a modelon-device without inevitably leaking the underlying model. At the same time,confidential computing technologies such as Multi-Party Computation orHomomorphic encryption remain impractical for wide adoption. In this paper wetake a different approach and investigate feasibility of ML-specific mechanismsthat deter unauthorized model use by restricting the model to only be usable onspecific hardware, making adoption on unauthorized hardware inconvenient. Thatway, even if IP is compromised, it cannot be trivially used without specialisedhardware or major model adjustment. In a sense, we seek to enable cheap lockingof machine learning models into specific hardware. We demonstrate that lockingmechanisms are feasible by either targeting efficiency of modelrepresentations, such making models incompatible with quantisation, or tie themodel's operation on specific characteristics of hardware, such as number ofcycles for arithmetic operations. We demonstrate that locking comes withnegligible work and latency overheads, while significantly restrictingusability of the resultant model on unauthorized hardware.</description><author>Eleanor Clifford, Adhithya Saravanan, Harry Langford, Cheng Zhang, Yiren Zhao, Robert Mullins, Ilia Shumailov, Jamie Hayes</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 17:35:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20990v1</guid></item><item><title>Communication-Efficient Distributed Deep Learning via Federated Dynamic Averaging</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20988v1</link><description>Driven by the ever-growing volume and decentralized nature of data, coupledwith the escalating size of modern models, distributed deep learning (DDL) hasbeen entrenched as the preferred paradigm for training. However, frequentsynchronization of DL models, encompassing millions to many billions ofparameters, creates a communication bottleneck, severely hindering scalability.Worse yet, DDL algorithms typically waste valuable bandwidth, and makethemselves less practical in bandwidth-constrained federated settings, byrelying on overly simplistic, periodic, and rigid synchronization schedules. Toaddress these shortcomings, we propose Federated Dynamic Averaging (FDA), acommunication-efficient DDL strategy that dynamically triggers synchronizationbased on the value of the model variance. Through extensive experiments acrossa wide range of learning tasks we demonstrate that FDA reduces communicationcost by orders of magnitude, compared to both traditional and cutting-edgecommunication-efficient algorithms.

Throughout the training process, GANs' output isanalyzed qualitatively based on the loss and synthetic images' diversity andquality. Based on this qualitative analysis, training is manually halted oncethe desired synthetic images are generated. By utilizing an early stoppingcriterion, the computational cost and dependence on manual oversight can bereduced yet impacted by training problems such as mode collapse,non-convergence, and instability. This is particularly prevalent in biomedicalimagery, where training problems degrade the diversity and quality of syntheticimages, and the high computational cost associated with training makes complexarchitectures increasingly inaccessible. This work proposes a novel earlystopping criteria to quantitatively detect training problems, halt training,and reduce the computational costs associated with synthesizing biomedicalimages.

Within suchgraphs, each relationship between two nodes represents a basic fact involvingthese two entities. The diversity of the semantics of relationships constitutesthe richness of knowledge graphs, leading to the emergence of singulartopologies, sometimes chaotic in appearance. However, this complexcharacteristic can be modeled in a simple way by introducing the concept ofsuperficiality, which controls the overlap between relationships whose factsare generated independently. With this model, superficiality also regulates thebalance of the global distribution of knowledge by determining the proportionof misdescribed entities. This is the first model for the structure anddynamics of knowledge graphs.

Motivated by the problem, this studyexamines the projector module by interpreting the vision-language semantic flowwithin MLLMs. Specifically, we trace back the semantic relevance flow fromgenerated language tokens to raw visual encoder patches and the intermediateoutputs produced by projectors. Our findings reveal that compressive projectors(e.g., QFormer), abstract visual patches into a limited set of semanticconcepts, such as objects or attributes, resulting in a 'double abstraction'phenomenon. This involves a first visual semantic abstraction by the projectorreferring to pre-defined query tokens, and a second extraction by the LLM basedon text instructions. The double abstraction is inefficient in training andwill result in cumulative vision semantics deficiency. To mitigate this issue,we propose the key insight of 'Decouple Compression from Abstraction (DeCo),that is compressing the visual token number at the patch level by projectorsand allowing the LLM to handle visual semantic abstraction entirely.Consequently, we adopt a simple compressor, i.e., 2D Adaptive Pooling, todownsample visual patches in a parameter-free manner. Empirical evaluationdemonstrates that DeCo surpasses traditional compressive projectors regardingboth performance and efficiency. It achieves performance gains of 0.9%, 7.1%,and 2.9% across the MLLM Benchmarks, Visual Localization, and Open-ended VQAtasks with fewer trainable parameters and faster convergence speed.</description><author>Linli Yao, Lei Li, Shuhuai Ren, Lean Wang, Yuanxin Liu, Xu Sun, Lu Hou</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 17:31:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20985v1</guid></item><item><title>Spiketrum: An FPGA-based Implementation of a Neuromorphic Cochlea</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15923v3</link><description>This paper presents a novel FPGA-based neuromorphic cochlea, leveraging thegeneral-purpose spike-coding algorithm, Spiketrum.

However, offline learned policiesare often suboptimal, and further online fine-tuning is required. In thispaper, we tackle the fundamental dilemma of offline-to-online fine-tuning: ifthe agent remains pessimistic, it may fail to learn a better policy, while ifit becomes optimistic directly, performance may suffer from a sudden drop. Weshow that Bayesian design principles are crucial in solving such a dilemma.Instead of adopting optimistic or pessimistic policies, the agent should act ina way that matches its belief in optimal policies. Such a probability-matching agent can avoid a sudden performance drop whilestill being guaranteed to find the optimal policy. Based on our theoreticalfindings, we introduce a novel algorithm that outperforms existing methods onvarious benchmarks, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.

Recentwork has used the query-efficient Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm toautomatically optimize the instructions given to black-box LLMs. However, BOusually falls short when optimizing highly sophisticated (e.g.,high-dimensional) objective functions, such as the functions mapping aninstruction to the performance of an LLM. This is mainly due to the limitedexpressive power of the Gaussian process (GP) which is used by BO as asurrogate to model the objective function. Meanwhile, it has been repeatedlyshown that neural networks (NNs), especially pre-trained transformers, possessstrong expressive power and can model highly complex functions. So, we adopt aneural bandit algorithm which replaces the GP in BO by an NN surrogate tooptimize instructions for black-box LLMs. More importantly, the neural banditalgorithm allows us to naturally couple the NN surrogate with the hiddenrepresentation learned by a pre-trained transformer (i.e., an open-source LLM),which significantly boosts its performance. These motivate us to propose ourINSTruction optimization usIng Neural bandits Coupled with Transformers(INSTINCT) algorithm.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as apromising solution, integrating knowledge from external databases to mitigatethese challenges. However, inappropriate retrieved passages can potentiallyhinder the LLMs' capacity to generate comprehensive and high-quality responses.Prior RAG studies on the robustness of retrieval noises often confinethemselves to a limited set of noise types, deviating from real-world retrievalenvironments and limiting practical applicability. In this study, we initiallyinvestigate retrieval noises and categorize them into three distinct types,reflecting real-world environments.

In response, many contribution evaluationmethods were proposed, where the server could evaluate the contribution made byeach client and incentivize the high-contributing clients to sustain theirlong-term participation in FL. Existing studies mainly focus on developing newmetrics or algorithms to better measure the contribution of each client.However, the security of contribution evaluation methods of FL operating inadversarial environments is largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose thefirst model poisoning attack on contribution evaluation methods in FL, termedACE. Specifically, we show that any malicious client utilizing ACE couldmanipulate the parameters of its local model such that it is evaluated to havea high contribution by the server, even when its local training data is indeedof low quality. We perform both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluationsof ACE. Theoretically, we show our design of ACE can effectively boost themalicious client's perceived contribution when the server employs thewidely-used cosine distance metric to measure contribution. Empirically, ourresults show ACE effectively and efficiently deceive five state-of-the-artcontribution evaluation methods. In addition, ACE preserves the accuracy of thefinal global models on testing inputs. We also explore six countermeasures todefend ACE.

Previous work elicits confidence from LLMs by direct orself-consistency prompting, or constructing specific datasets for supervisedfinetuning. The prompting-based approaches have inferior performance, and thetraining-based approaches are limited to binary or inaccurate group-levelconfidence estimates. In this work, we present the advanced SaySelf, a trainingframework that teaches LLMs to express more accurate fine-grained confidenceestimates. In addition, beyond the confidence scores, SaySelf initiates theprocess of directing LLMs to produce self-reflective rationales that clearlyidentify gaps in their parametric knowledge and explain their uncertainty. Thisis achieved by using an LLM to automatically summarize the uncertainties inspecific knowledge via natural language. The summarization is based on theanalysis of the inconsistency in multiple sampled reasoning chains, and theresulting data is utilized for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, we utilizereinforcement learning with a meticulously crafted reward function to calibratethe confidence estimates, motivating LLMs to deliver accurate, high-confidencepredictions and to penalize overconfidence in erroneous outputs. Experimentalresults in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets demonstratethe effectiveness of SaySelf in reducing the confidence calibration error andmaintaining the task performance. We show that the generated self-reflectiverationales are reasonable and can further contribute to the calibration.

The models designed to tackle next-locationprediction, however, require a significant amount of individual-levelinformation to be trained effectively. Such data may be scarce or evenunavailable in some geographic regions or peculiar scenarios (e.g., cold-startin recommendation systems). Moreover, the design of a next-location predictorable to generalize or geographically transfer knowledge is still an openresearch challenge. Recent advances in natural language processing have led toa rapid diffusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) which have shown goodgeneralization and reasoning capabilities. These insights, coupled with therecent findings that LLMs are rich in geographical knowledge, allowed us tobelieve that these models can act as zero-shot next-location predictors. Thispaper evaluates the capabilities of many popular LLMs in this role,specifically Llama, GPT-3.5 and Mistral 7B. After designing a proper prompt, wetested the models on three real-world mobility datasets. The results show thatLLMs can obtain accuracies up to 32.4%, a significant relative improvement ofover 600% when compared to sophisticated DL models specifically designed forhuman mobility. Moreover, we show that other LLMs are unable to perform thetask properly. To prevent positively biased results, we also propose aframework inspired by other studies to test data contamination. Finally, weexplored the possibility of using LLMs as text-based explainers fornext-location prediction showing that can effectively provide an explanationfor their decision. Notably, 7B models provide more generic, but stillreliable, explanations compared to larger counterparts.

Our inference algorithm exploits thecovariance structures that arise naturally from sample based approximateGaussian message passing and low-rank amortized posterior updates --effectively performing approximate variational smoothing with time complexityscaling linearly in the state dimensionality. In comparisons with other deepstate-space model architectures our approach consistently demonstrates theability to learn a more predictive generative model. Furthermore, when appliedto neural physiological recordings, our approach is able to learn a dynamicalsystem capable of forecasting population spiking and behavioral correlates froma small portion of single trials.</description><author>Matthew Dowling, Yuan Zhao, Il Memming Park</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 17:05:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01371v2</guid></item><item><title>Behind Every Domain There is a Shift: Adapting Distortion-aware Vision Transformers for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11860v5</link><description>In this paper, we address panoramic semantic segmentation which isunder-explored due to two critical challenges: (1) image distortions and objectdeformations on panoramas; (2) lack of semantic annotations in the 360{\deg}imagery. To tackle these problems, first, we propose the upgraded Transformerfor Panoramic Semantic Segmentation, i.e., Trans4PASS+, equipped withDeformable Patch Embedding (DPE) and Deformable MLP (DMLPv2) modules forhandling object deformations and image distortions whenever (before or afteradaptation) and wherever (shallow or deep levels). Second, we enhance theMutual Prototypical Adaptation (MPA) strategy via pseudo-label rectificationfor unsupervised domain adaptive panoramic segmentation. Third, aside fromPinhole-to-Panoramic (Pin2Pan) adaptation, we create a new dataset (SynPASS)with 9,080 panoramic images, facilitating Synthetic-to-Real (Syn2Real)adaptation scheme in 360{\deg} imagery. Extensive experiments are conducted,which cover indoor and outdoor scenarios, and each of them is investigated withPin2Pan and Syn2Real regimens.

Synthetic data have emerged asan alternative when no real data is available (e.g., due to privacyregulations). Synthesizing tabular data presents unique and complex challenges,especially handling (i) missing values, (ii) dataset imbalance, (iii) diversecolumn types, and (iv) complex data distributions, as well as preserving (i)column correlations, (ii) temporal dependencies, and (iii) integrityconstraints (e.g., functional dependencies) present in the original dataset.While substantial progress has been made recently in the context ofgenerational models, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for tabular datatoday, and choosing the right tool for a given task is therefore no trivialtask. In this paper, we survey the state of the art in Tabular Data Synthesis(TDS), examine the needs of users by defining a set of functional andnon-functional requirements, and compile the challenges associated with meetingthose needs. In addition, we evaluate the reported performance of 36 popularresearch TDS tools about these requirements and develop a decision guide tohelp users find suitable TDS tools for their applications. The resultingdecision guide also identifies significant research gaps.</description><author>Maria F.

In this work, we propose a new intricate large-scaleMulti-scene Video Portrait Segmentation dataset MVPS consisting of 101 videoclips in 7 scenario categories, in which 10,843 sampled frames are finelyannotated at pixel level. The dataset has diverse scenes and complicatedbackground environments, which is the most complex dataset in VPS to our bestknowledge. Through the observation of a large number of videos with portraitsduring dataset construction, we find that due to the joint structure of humanbody, motion of portraits is part-associated, which leads that different partsare relatively independent in motion. That is, motion of different parts of theportraits is imbalanced. Towards this imbalance, an intuitive and reasonableidea is that different motion states in portraits can be better exploited bydecoupling the portraits into parts. To achieve this, we propose aPart-Decoupling Network (PDNet) for video portrait segmentation. Specifically,an Inter-frame Part-Discriminated Attention (IPDA) module is proposed whichunsupervisedly segments portrait into parts and utilizes differentattentiveness on discriminative features specified to each different part. Inthis way, appropriate attention can be imposed to portrait parts withimbalanced motion to extract part-discriminated correlations, so that theportraits can be segmented more accurately. Experimental results demonstratethat our method achieves leading performance with the comparison tostate-of-the-art methods.</description><author>Tianshu Yu, Changqun Xia, Jia Li</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 17:00:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16565v2</guid></item><item><title>Not Just Novelty: A Longitudinal Study on Utility and Customization of an AI Workflow</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09894v2</link><description>Generative AI brings novel and impressive abilities to help people ineveryday tasks. There are many AI workflows that solve real and complexproblems by chaining AI outputs together with human interaction. Although thereis an undeniable lure of AI, it is uncertain how useful generative AI workflowsare after the novelty wears off. Additionally, workflows built with generativeAI have the potential to be easily customized to fit users' individual needs,but do users take advantage of this? We conducted a three-week longitudinalstudy with 12 users to understand the familiarization and customization ofgenerative AI tools for science communication. Our study revealed that thereexists a familiarization phase, during which users were exploring the novelcapabilities of the workflow and discovering which aspects they found useful.After this phase, users understood the workflow and were able to anticipate theoutputs. Surprisingly, after familiarization the perceived utility of thesystem was rated higher than before, indicating that the perceived utility ofAI is not just a novelty effect. The increase in benefits mainly comes fromend-users' ability to customize prompts, and thus potentially appropriate thesystem to their own needs. This points to a future where generative AI systemscan allow us to design for appropriation.</description><author>Tao Long, Katy Ilonka Gero, Lydia B.

We propose online cascade learning, the firstapproach to address this challenge. The objective here is to learn a "cascade"of models, starting with lower-capacity models (such as logistic regression)and ending with a powerful LLM, along with a deferral policy that determinesthe model to be used on a given input. We formulate the task of learningcascades online as an imitation-learning problem, where smaller models areupdated over time imitating the collected LLM demonstrations, and give ano-regret algorithm for the problem. Experimental results across fourbenchmarks show that our method parallels LLMs in accuracy while cutting downinference costs by as much as 90% with strong robustness against inputdistribution shifts, underscoring its efficacy and adaptability in streamprocessing.</description><author>Lunyiu Nie, Zhimin Ding, Erdong Hu, Christopher Jermaine, Swarat Chaudhuri</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 16:59:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04513v2</guid></item><item><title>The Victim and The Beneficiary: Exploiting a Poisoned Model to Train a Clean Model on Poisoned Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11265v2</link><description>Recently, backdoor attacks have posed a serious security threat to thetraining process of deep neural networks (DNNs). The attacked model behavesnormally on benign samples but outputs a specific result when the trigger ispresent. However, compared with the rocketing progress of backdoor attacks,existing defenses are difficult to deal with these threats effectively orrequire benign samples to work, which may be unavailable in real scenarios. Inthis paper, we find that the poisoned samples and benign samples can bedistinguished with prediction entropy. This inspires us to propose a noveldual-network training framework: The Victim and The Beneficiary (V&amp;B), whichexploits a poisoned model to train a clean model without extra benign samples.Firstly, we sacrifice the Victim network to be a powerful poisoned sampledetector by training on suspicious samples. Secondly, we train the Beneficiarynetwork on the credible samples selected by the Victim to inhibit backdoorinjection. Thirdly, a semi-supervised suppression strategy is adopted forerasing potential backdoors and improving model performance. Furthermore, tobetter inhibit missed poisoned samples, we propose a strong data augmentationmethod, AttentionMix, which works well with our proposed V&amp;B framework.Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets against 6 state-of-the-artattacks demonstrate that our framework is effective in preventing backdoorinjection and robust to various attacks while maintaining the performance onbenign samples.

In this paper, we present \textit{SemRel}, a new semanticrelatedness dataset collection annotated by native speakers across 13languages: \textit{Afrikaans, Algerian Arabic, Amharic, English, Hausa, Hindi,Indonesian, Kinyarwanda, Marathi, Moroccan Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic,Spanish,} and \textit{Telugu}. These languages originate from five distinctlanguage families and are predominantly spoken in Africa and Asia -- regionscharacterised by a relatively limited availability of NLP resources.

The workshop consisted of a comedy writingsession with large language models (LLMs), a human-computer interactionquestionnaire to assess the Creativity Support Index of AI as a writing tool,and a focus group interrogating the comedians' motivations for and processes ofusing AI, as well as their ethical concerns about bias, censorship andcopyright. Participants noted that existing moderation strategies used insafety filtering and instruction-tuned LLMs reinforced hegemonic viewpoints byerasing minority groups and their perspectives, and qualified this as a form ofcensorship. At the same time, most participants felt the LLMs did not succeedas a creativity support tool, by producing bland and biased comedy tropes, akinto ``cruise ship comedy material from the 1950s, but a bit less racist''. Ourwork extends scholarship about the subtle difference between, one the one hand,harmful speech, and on the other hand, ``offensive'' language as a practice ofresistance, satire and ``punching up''.

Following training, the performance of this same neuralnetwork is evaluated using an application-specific metric based on themulticlass confusion matrix, such as the Macro $F_\beta$-Score. It isquestionable whether the use of cross-entropy will yield a classifier thataligns with the intended application-specific performance criteria,particularly in scenarios where there is a need to emphasize one aspect ofclassifier performance. For example, if greater precision is preferred overrecall, the $\beta$ value in the $F_\beta$ evaluation metric can be adjustedaccordingly, but the cross-entropy objective remains unaware of this preferenceduring training. We propose a method that addresses this training-evaluationgap for multiclass neural network classifiers such that users can train thesemodels informed by the desired final $F_\beta$-Score. Following prior work inbinary classification, we utilize the concepts of the soft-set confusionmatrices and a piecewise-linear approximation of the Heaviside step function.Our method extends the $2 \times 2$ binary soft-set confusion matrix to amulticlass $d \times d$ confusion matrix and proposes dynamic adaptation of thethreshold value $\tau$, which parameterizes the piecewise-linear Heavisideapproximation during run-time. We present a theoretical analysis that showsthat our method can be used to optimize for a soft-set based approximation ofMacro-$F_\beta$ that is a consistent estimator of Macro-$F_\beta$, and ourextensive experiments show the practical effectiveness of our approach.</description><author>Nathan Tsoi, Deyuan Li, Taesoo Daniel Lee, Marynel Vázquez</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 16:54:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20954v1</guid></item><item><title>Monte Carlo Tree Search Satellite Scheduling Under Cloud Cover Uncertainty</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20951v1</link><description>Efficient utilization of satellite resources in dynamic environments remainsa challenging problem in satellite scheduling.

To address these challenges, we introduce theHybrid Floating-point Quantization for DiT(HQ-DiT), an efficient post-trainingquantization method that utilizes 4-bit floating-point (FP) precision on bothweights and activations for DiT inference. Compared to fixed-point quantization(e.g., INT8), FP quantization, complemented by our proposed clipping rangeselection mechanism, naturally aligns with the data distribution within DiT,resulting in a minimal quantization error. Furthermore, HQ-DiT also implementsa universal identity mathematical transform to mitigate the seriousquantization error caused by the outliers. The experimental results demonstratethat DiT can achieve extremely low-precision quantization (i.e., 4 bits) withnegligible impact on performance. Our approach marks the first instance whereboth weights and activations in DiTs are quantized to just 4 bits, with only a0.12 increase in sFID on ImageNet.</description><author>Wenxuan Liu, Sai Qian Zhang</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 16:48:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19751v2</guid></item><item><title>Perimeter Control with Heterogeneous Metering Rates for Cordon Signals: A Physics-Regularized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12985v2</link><description>Perimeter Control (PC) strategies have been proposed to address urban roadnetwork control in oversaturated situations by regulating the transfer flow ofthe Protected Network (PN) based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD).The uniform metering rate for cordon signals in most existing studies overlooksthe variance of local traffic states at the intersection level, which may causesevere local traffic congestion and degradation of the network stability. PCstrategies with heterogeneous metering rates for cordon signals allow precisecontrol for the perimeter but the complexity of the problem increasesexponentially with the scale of the PN. This paper leverages a Multi-AgentReinforcement Learning (MARL)-based traffic signal control framework todecompose this PC problem, which considers heterogeneous metering rates forcordon signals, into multi-agent cooperation tasks. Each agent controls anindividual signal located in the cordon, decreasing the dimension of actionspace for the controller compared to centralized methods. A physicsregularization approach for the MARL framework is proposed to ensure thedistributed cordon signal controllers are aware of the global network state byencoding MFD-based knowledge into the action-value functions of the localagents. The proposed PC strategy is operated as a two-stage system, with afeedback PC strategy detecting the overall traffic state within the PN and thendistributing local instructions to cordon signals controllers in the MARLframework via the physics regularization. Through numerical tests withdifferent demand patterns in a microscopic traffic environment, the proposed PCstrategy shows promising robustness and transferability. It outperformsstate-of-the-art feedback PC strategies in increasing network throughput,decreasing distributed delay for gate links, and reducing carbon emissions.</description><author>Jiajie Yu, Pierre-Antoine Laharotte, Yu Han, Wei Ma, Ludovic Leclercq</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 16:44:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12985v2</guid></item><item><title>OR-Bench: An Over-Refusal Benchmark for Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20947v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) require careful safety alignment to preventmalicious outputs. While significant research focuses on mitigating harmfulcontent generation, the enhanced safety often come with the side effect ofover-refusal, where the LLMs may reject innocuous prompts and become lesshelpful. Although the issue of over-refusal has been empirically observed, asystematic measurement is challenging due to the difficulty of crafting promptsthat appear harmful but are benign. This study proposes a novel method forautomatically generating large-scale sets of ``seemingly toxic prompts''(benign prompts likely rejected by LLMs). Leveraging this technique, weintroduce OR-Bench, the first large-scale over-refusal benchmark. OR-Benchcomprises 80,000 seemingly toxic prompts across 10 common rejection categories,a subset of around 1,000 hard prompts that are challenging even forstate-of-the-art LLMs, and an additional 600 toxic prompts to preventindiscriminate responses. We then conduct a comprehensive study to measure theover-refusal of 25 popular LLMs across 8 model families. Our datasets areavailable at https://huggingface.co/datasets/bench-llm/OR-Bench and thecorresponding demo can be found athttps://huggingface.co/spaces/bench-llm/or-bench.

Two key hurdles are the availability of aligned data(concepts that contain similar meaning but is expressed differently indifferent modalities), and effectively leveraging unimodal representations incross-domain generative tasks, without compromising their original unimodalcapabilities. We propose Zipper, a multi-tower decoder architecture that addresses theseconcerns by using cross-attention to flexibly compose multimodal generativemodels from independently pre-trained unimodal decoders. In our experimentsfusing speech and text modalities, we show the proposed architecture performsvery competitively in scenarios with limited aligned text-speech data. We alsoshowcase the flexibility of our model to selectively maintain unimodal (e.g.,text-to-text generation) generation performance by freezing the correspondingmodal tower (e.g. text). In cross-modal tasks such as automatic speechrecognition (ASR) where the output modality is text, we show that freezing thetext backbone results in negligible performance degradation.

Sparsity and quantization are two prominent compression methods thathave individually demonstrated significant reduction in computational andmemory footprints while preserving model accuracy. While effective, theinterplay between these two methods remains an open question. In this paper, weinvestigate the interaction between these two methods and assess whether theircombination impacts final model accuracy. We mathematically prove that applyingsparsity before quantization is the optimal sequence for these operations,minimizing error in computation. Our empirical studies across a wide range ofmodels, including OPT and Llama model families (125M-8B) and ViT corroboratethese theoretical findings. In addition, through rigorous analysis, wedemonstrate that sparsity and quantization are not orthogonal; theirinteraction can significantly harm model accuracy, with quantization errorplaying a dominant role in this degradation.

Whilecurrent agents can learn to execute simple language instructions, we aim tobuild agents that leverage diverse language -- language like "this button turnson the TV" or "I put the bowls away" -- that conveys general knowledge,describes the state of the world, provides interactive feedback, and more. Ourkey idea is that agents should interpret such diverse language as a signal thathelps them predict the future: what they will observe, how the world willbehave, and which situations will be rewarded. This perspective unifieslanguage understanding with future prediction as a powerful self-supervisedlearning objective. We instantiate this in Dynalang, an agent that learns amultimodal world model to predict future text and image representations, andlearns to act from imagined model rollouts. While current methods that learnlanguage-conditioned policies degrade in performance with more diverse types oflanguage, we show that Dynalang learns to leverage environment descriptions,game rules, and instructions to excel on tasks ranging from game-playing tonavigating photorealistic home scans. Finally, we show that our method enablesadditional capabilities due to learning a generative model: Dynalang can bepretrained on text-only data, enabling learning from offline datasets, andgenerate language grounded in an environment.</description><author>Jessy Lin, Yuqing Du, Olivia Watkins, Danijar Hafner, Pieter Abbeel, Dan Klein, Anca Dragan</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 16:32:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01399v2</guid></item><item><title>GUIDE: Guidance-based Incremental Learning with Diffusion Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03938v2</link><description>We introduce GUIDE, a novel continual learning approach that directsdiffusion models to rehearse samples at risk of being forgotten.

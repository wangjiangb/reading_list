Existing works mainly focus on languageand image instruction tuning, different from which, our ImageBind-LLM canrespond to multi-modality conditions, including audio, 3D point clouds, video,and their embedding-space arithmetic by only image-text alignment training.During training, we adopt a learnable bind network to align the embedding spacebetween LLaMA and ImageBind's image encoder. Then, the image featurestransformed by the bind network are added to word tokens of all layers inLLaMA, which progressively injects visual instructions via an attention-freeand zero-initialized gating mechanism. Aided by the joint embedding ofImageBind, the simple image-text training enables our model to exhibit superiormulti-modality instruction-following capabilities. During inference, themulti-modality inputs are fed into the corresponding ImageBind encoders, andprocessed by a proposed visual cache model for further cross-modal embeddingenhancement. The training-free cache model retrieves from three million imagefeatures extracted by ImageBind, which effectively mitigates thetraining-inference modality discrepancy. Notably, with our approach,ImageBind-LLM can respond to instructions of diverse modalities and demonstratesignificant language generation quality.

Inspired by such a philosophy, we present Aurora, a GAN-basedtext-to-image generator that employs a collection of experts to learn featureprocessing, together with a sparse router to help select the most suitableexpert for each feature point. To faithfully decode the sampling stochasticityand the text condition to the final synthesis, our router adaptively makes itsdecision by taking into account the text-integrated global latent code. At64x64 image resolution, our model trained on LAION2B-en and COYO-700M achieves6.2 zero-shot FID on MS COCO. We release the code and checkpoints to facilitatethe community for further development.</description><author>Jiapeng Zhu, Ceyuan Yang, Kecheng Zheng, Yinghao Xu, Zifan Shi, Yujun Shen</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:59:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03904v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning Continuous Exposure Value Representations for Single-Image HDR Reconstruction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03900v1</link><description>Deep learning is commonly used to reconstruct HDR images from LDR images. LDRstack-based methods are used for single-image HDR reconstruction, generating anHDR image from a deep learning-generated LDR stack. However, current methodsgenerate the stack with predetermined exposure values (EVs), which may limitthe quality of HDR reconstruction. To address this, we propose the continuousexposure value representation (CEVR), which uses an implicit function togenerate LDR images with arbitrary EVs, including those unseen during training.Our approach generates a continuous stack with more images containing diverseEVs, significantly improving HDR reconstruction. We use a cycle trainingstrategy to supervise the model in generating continuous EV LDR images withoutcorresponding ground truths. Our CEVR model outperforms existing methods, asdemonstrated by experimental results.</description><author>Su-Kai Chen, Hung-Lin Yen, Yu-Lun Liu, Min-Hung Chen, Hou-Ning Hu, Wen-Hsiao Peng, Yen-Yu Lin</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:59:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03900v1</guid></item><item><title>The Making and Breaking of Camouflage</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03899v1</link><description>Not all camouflages are equally effective, as even a partially visiblecontour or a slight color difference can make the animal stand out and breakits camouflage. In this paper, we address the question of what makes acamouflage successful, by proposing three scores for automatically assessingits effectiveness. In particular, we show that camouflage can be measured bythe similarity between background and foreground features and boundaryvisibility. We use these camouflage scores to assess and compare all availablecamouflage datasets. We also incorporate the proposed camouflage score into agenerative model as an auxiliary loss and show that effective camouflage imagesor videos can be synthesised in a scalable manner. The generated syntheticdataset is used to train a transformer-based model for segmenting camouflagedanimals in videos. Experimentally, we demonstrate state-of-the-art camouflagebreaking performance on the public MoCA-Mask benchmark.</description><author>Hala Lamdouar, Weidi Xie, Andrew Zisserman</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:58:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03899v1</guid></item><item><title>ProPainter: Improving Propagation and Transformer for Video Inpainting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03897v1</link><description>Flow-based propagation and spatiotemporal Transformer are two mainstreammechanisms in video inpainting (VI). Despite the effectiveness of thesecomponents, they still suffer from some limitations that affect theirperformance. Previous propagation-based approaches are performed separatelyeither in the image or feature domain. Global image propagation isolated fromlearning may cause spatial misalignment due to inaccurate optical flow.Moreover, memory or computational constraints limit the temporal range offeature propagation and video Transformer, preventing exploration ofcorrespondence information from distant frames. To address these issues, wepropose an improved framework, called ProPainter, which involves enhancedProPagation and an efficient Transformer. Specifically, we introducedual-domain propagation that combines the advantages of image and featurewarping, exploiting global correspondences reliably. We also propose amask-guided sparse video Transformer, which achieves high efficiency bydiscarding unnecessary and redundant tokens. With these components, ProPainteroutperforms prior arts by a large margin of 1.46 dB in PSNR while maintainingappealing efficiency.</description><author>Shangchen Zhou, Chongyi Li, Kelvin C. K.

Unlike existing approaches thatintegrate prior knowledge and pre-define the output space (e.g., categories andcoordinates) for each vision task, we cast diverse vision tasks into ahuman-intuitive image-manipulating process whose output space is a flexible andinteractive pixel space. Concretely, the model is built upon the diffusionprocess and is trained to predict pixels according to user instructions, suchas encircling the man's left shoulder in red or applying a blue mask to theleft car. InstructDiffusion could handle a variety of vision tasks, includingunderstanding tasks (such as segmentation and keypoint detection) andgenerative tasks (such as editing and enhancement). It even exhibits theability to handle unseen tasks and outperforms prior methods on novel datasets.This represents a significant step towards a generalist modeling interface forvision tasks, advancing artificial general intelligence in the field ofcomputer vision.</description><author>Zigang Geng, Binxin Yang, Tiankai Hang, Chen Li, Shuyang Gu, Ting Zhang, Jianmin Bao, Zheng Zhang, Han Hu, Dong Chen, Baining Guo</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:56:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03895v1</guid></item><item><title>DiffusionEngine: Diffusion Model is Scalable Data Engine for Object Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03893v1</link><description>Data is the cornerstone of deep learning. This paper reveals that therecently developed Diffusion Model is a scalable data engine for objectdetection. Existing methods for scaling up detection-oriented data oftenrequire manual collection or generative models to obtain target images,followed by data augmentation and labeling to produce training pairs, which arecostly, complex, or lacking diversity. To address these issues, wepresentDiffusionEngine (DE), a data scaling-up engine that provideshigh-quality detection-oriented training pairs in a single stage. DE consistsof a pre-trained diffusion model and an effective Detection-Adapter,contributing to generating scalable, diverse and generalizable detection datain a plug-and-play manner. Detection-Adapter is learned to align the implicitsemantic and location knowledge in off-the-shelf diffusion models withdetection-aware signals to make better bounding-box predictions. Additionally,we contribute two datasets, i.e., COCO-DE and VOC-DE, to scale up existingdetection benchmarks for facilitating follow-up research. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate that data scaling-up via DE can achieve significant improvements indiverse scenarios, such as various detection algorithms, self-supervisedpre-training, data-sparse, label-scarce, cross-domain, and semi-supervisedlearning. For example, when using DE with a DINO-based adapter to scale updata, mAP is improved by 3.1% on COCO, 7.6% on VOC, and 11.5% on Clipart.</description><author>Manlin Zhang, Jie Wu, Yuxi Ren, Ming Li, Jie Qin, Xuefeng Xiao, Wei Liu, Rui Wang, Min Zheng, Andy J.

This task is challengingdue to the diversity of the global wrist motions and the precise finger controlthat are necessary to articulate objects. ArtiGrasp leverages reinforcementlearning and physics simulations to train a policy that controls the global andlocal hand pose. Our framework unifies grasping and articulation within asingle policy guided by a single hand pose reference. Moreover, to facilitatethe training of the precise finger control required for articulation, wepresent a learning curriculum with increasing difficulty. It starts withsingle-hand manipulation of stationary objects and continues with multi-agenttraining including both hands and non-stationary objects. To evaluate ourmethod, we introduce Dynamic Object Grasping and Articulation, a task thatinvolves bringing an object into a target articulated pose. This task requiresgrasping, relocation, and articulation. We show our method's efficacy towardsthis task. We further demonstrate that our method can generate motions withnoisy hand-object pose estimates from an off-the-shelf image-based regressor.</description><author>Hui Zhang, Sammy Christen, Zicong Fan, Luocheng Zheng, Jemin Hwangbo, Jie Song, Otmar Hilliges</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:53:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03891v1</guid></item><item><title>Transformers as Support Vector Machines</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16898v2</link><description>Since its inception in "Attention Is All You Need", transformer architecturehas led to revolutionary advancements in NLP. The attention layer within thetransformer admits a sequence of input tokens $X$ and makes them interactthrough pairwise similarities computed as softmax$(XQK^\top X^\top)$, where$(K,Q)$ are the trainable key-query parameters. In this work, we establish aformal equivalence between the optimization geometry of self-attention and ahard-margin SVM problem that separates optimal input tokens from non-optimaltokens using linear constraints on the outer-products of token pairs. Thisformalism allows us to characterize the implicit bias of 1-layer transformersoptimized with gradient descent: (1) Optimizing the attention layer withvanishing regularization, parameterized by $(K,Q)$, converges in direction toan SVM solution minimizing the nuclear norm of the combined parameter$W=KQ^\top$. Instead, directly parameterizing by $W$ minimizes a Frobenius normobjective. We characterize this convergence, highlighting that it can occurtoward locally-optimal directions rather than global ones. (2) Complementingthis, we prove the local/global directional convergence of gradient descentunder suitable geometric conditions. Importantly, we show thatover-parameterization catalyzes global convergence by ensuring the feasibilityof the SVM problem and by guaranteeing a benign optimization landscape devoidof stationary points. (3) While our theory applies primarily to linearprediction heads, we propose a more general SVM equivalence that predicts theimplicit bias with nonlinear heads. Our findings are applicable to arbitrarydatasets and their validity is verified via experiments. We also introduceseveral open problems and research directions. We believe these findingsinspire the interpretation of transformers as a hierarchy of SVMs thatseparates and selects optimal tokens.</description><author>Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Christos Thrampoulidis, Samet Oymak</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:50:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16898v2</guid></item><item><title>A Function Interpretation Benchmark for Evaluating Interpretability Methods</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03886v1</link><description>Labeling neural network submodules with human-legible descriptions is usefulfor many downstream tasks: such descriptions can surface failures, guideinterventions, and perhaps even explain important model behaviors. To date,most mechanistic descriptions of trained networks have involved small models,narrowly delimited phenomena, and large amounts of human labor. Labeling allhuman-interpretable sub-computations in models of increasing size andcomplexity will almost certainly require tools that can generate and validatedescriptions automatically. Recently, techniques that use learned modelsin-the-loop for labeling have begun to gain traction, but methods forevaluating their efficacy are limited and ad-hoc. How should we validate andcompare open-ended labeling tools? This paper introduces FIND (FunctionINterpretation and Description), a benchmark suite for evaluating the buildingblocks of automated interpretability methods. FIND contains functions thatresemble components of trained neural networks, and accompanying descriptionsof the kind we seek to generate. The functions are procedurally constructedacross textual and numeric domains, and involve a range of real-worldcomplexities, including noise, composition, approximation, and bias. Weevaluate new and existing methods that use language models (LMs) to producecode-based and language descriptions of function behavior. We find that anoff-the-shelf LM augmented with only black-box access to functions cansometimes infer their structure, acting as a scientist by forming hypotheses,proposing experiments, and updating descriptions in light of new data. However,LM-based descriptions tend to capture global function behavior and miss localcorruptions. These results show that FIND will be useful for characterizing theperformance of more sophisticated interpretability methods before they areapplied to real-world models.</description><author>Sarah Schwettmann, Tamar Rott Shaham, Joanna Materzynska, Neil Chowdhury, Shuang Li, Jacob Andreas, David Bau, Antonio Torralba</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:47:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03886v1</guid></item><item><title>Zero-Shot Audio Captioning via Audibility Guidance</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03884v1</link><description>The task of audio captioning is similar in essence to tasks such as image andvideo captioning. However, it has received much less attention. We proposethree desiderata for captioning audio -- (i) fluency of the generated text,(ii) faithfulness of the generated text to the input audio, and the somewhatrelated (iii) audibility, which is the quality of being able to be perceivedbased only on audio. Our method is a zero-shot method, i.e., we do not learn toperform captioning. Instead, captioning occurs as an inference process thatinvolves three networks that correspond to the three desired qualities: (i) ALarge Language Model, in our case, for reasons of convenience, GPT-2, (ii) Amodel that provides a matching score between an audio file and a text, forwhich we use a multimodal matching network called ImageBind, and (iii) A textclassifier, trained using a dataset we collected automatically by instructingGPT-4 with prompts designed to direct the generation of both audible andinaudible sentences. We present our results on the AudioCap dataset,demonstrating that audibility guidance significantly enhances performancecompared to the baseline, which lacks this objective.</description><author>Tal Shaharabany, Ariel Shaulov, Lior Wolf</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:45:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03884v1</guid></item><item><title>DoLa: Decoding by Contrasting Layers Improves Factuality in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03883v1</link><description>Despite their impressive capabilities, large language models (LLMs) are proneto hallucinations, i.e., generating content that deviates from facts seenduring pretraining. We propose a simple decoding strategy for reducinghallucinations with pretrained LLMs that does not require conditioning onretrieved external knowledge nor additional fine-tuning. Our approach obtainsthe next-token distribution by contrasting the differences in logits obtainedfrom projecting the later layers versus earlier layers to the vocabulary space,exploiting the fact that factual knowledge in an LLMs has generally been shownto be localized to particular transformer layers. We find that this Decoding byContrasting Layers (DoLa) approach is able to better surface factual knowledgeand reduce the generation of incorrect facts. DoLa consistently improves thetruthfulness across multiple choices tasks and open-ended generation tasks, forexample improving the performance of LLaMA family models on TruthfulQA by12-17% absolute points, demonstrating its potential in making LLMs reliablygenerate truthful facts.</description><author>Yung-Sung Chuang, Yujia Xie, Hongyin Luo, Yoon Kim, James Glass, Pengcheng He</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:45:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03883v1</guid></item><item><title>On Large Language Models' Selection Bias in Multi-Choice Questions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03882v1</link><description>Multi-choice questions (MCQs) serve as a common yet important task format inthe research of large language models (LLMs). Our work shows that LLMs exhibitan inherent "selection bias" in MCQs, which refers to LLMs' preferences toselect options located at specific positions (like "Option C"). This bias isprevalent across various LLMs, making their performance vulnerable to optionposition changes in MCQs. We identify that one primary cause resulting inselection bias is option numbering, i.e., the ID symbols A/B/C/D associatedwith the options. To mitigate selection bias, we propose a new method calledPriDe. PriDe first decomposes the observed model prediction distribution intoan intrinsic prediction over option contents and a prior distribution overoption IDs. It then estimates the prior by permutating option contents on asmall number of test samples, which is used to debias the subsequent testsamples. We demonstrate that, as a label-free, inference-time method, PriDeachieves a more effective and computation-efficient debiasing than strongbaselines. We further show that the priors estimated by PriDe generalize wellacross different domains, highlighting its practical potential in broaderscenarios.</description><author>Chujie Zheng, Hao Zhou, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Minlie Huang</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:44:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03882v1</guid></item><item><title>Better Practices for Domain Adaptation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03879v1</link><description>Distribution shifts are all too common in real-world applications of machinelearning. Domain adaptation (DA) aims to address this by providing variousframeworks for adapting models to the deployment data without using labels.However, the domain shift scenario raises a second more subtle challenge: thedifficulty of performing hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) for these adaptationalgorithms without access to a labelled validation set. The unclear validationprotocol for DA has led to bad practices in the literature, such as performingHPO using the target test labels when, in real-world scenarios, they are notavailable. This has resulted in over-optimism about DA research progresscompared to reality. In this paper, we analyse the state of DA when using goodevaluation practice, by benchmarking a suite of candidate validation criteriaand using them to assess popular adaptation algorithms. We show that there arechallenges across all three branches of domain adaptation methodology includingUnsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), andTest Time Adaptation (TTA). While the results show that realisticallyachievable performance is often worse than expected, they also show that usingproper validation splits is beneficial, as well as showing that some previouslyunexplored validation metrics provide the best options to date. Altogether, ourimproved practices covering data, training, validation and hyperparameteroptimisation form a new rigorous pipeline to improve benchmarking, and henceresearch progress, within this important field going forward.</description><author>Linus Ericsson, Da Li, Timothy M.

Inthis paper, we show that under very mild regularity conditions (in particular,involving only weak continuity of the transition kernel of an MDP), Q-learningfor standard Borel MDPs via quantization of states and actions (calledQuantized Q-Learning) converges to a limit, and furthermore this limitsatisfies an optimality equation which leads to near optimality with eitherexplicit performance bounds or which are guaranteed to be asymptoticallyoptimal. Our approach builds on (i) viewing quantization as a measurementkernel and thus a quantized MDP as a partially observed Markov decision process(POMDP), (ii) utilizing near optimality and convergence results of Q-learningfor POMDPs, and (iii) finally, near-optimality of finite state modelapproximations for MDPs with weakly continuous kernels which we show tocorrespond to the fixed point of the constructed POMDP. Thus, our paperpresents a very general convergence and approximation result for theapplicability of Q-learning for continuous MDPs.</description><author>Ali Devran Kara, Naci Saldi, Serdar Yüksel</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:42:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06781v3</guid></item><item><title>Introducing "Forecast Utterance" for Conversational Data Science</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03877v1</link><description>Envision an intelligent agent capable of assisting users in conductingforecasting tasks through intuitive, natural conversations, without requiringin-depth knowledge of the underlying machine learning (ML) processes. Asignificant challenge for the agent in this endeavor is to accuratelycomprehend the user's prediction goals and, consequently, formulate precise MLtasks. In this paper, we take a pioneering step towards this ambitious goal byintroducing a new concept called Forecast Utterance and then focus on theautomatic and accurate interpretation of users' prediction goals from theseutterances. Specifically, we frame the task as a slot-filling problem, whereeach slot corresponds to a specific aspect of the goal prediction task. We thenemploy two zero-shot methods for solving the slot-filling task, namely: 1)Entity Extraction (EE), and 2) Question-Answering (QA) techniques. Ourexperiments, conducted with three meticulously crafted data sets, validate theviability of our ambitious goal and demonstrate the effectiveness of both EEand QA techniques in interpreting Forecast Utterances.</description><author>Md Mahadi Hassan, Alex Knipper, Shubhra Kanti Karmaker</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:41:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03877v1</guid></item><item><title>OpinionGPT: Modelling Explicit Biases in Instruction-Tuned LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03876v1</link><description>Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently showcasedremarkable ability to generate fitting responses to natural languageinstructions. However, an open research question concerns the inherent biasesof trained models and their responses. For instance, if the data used to tunean LLM is dominantly written by persons with a specific political bias, wemight expect generated answers to share this bias. Current research work seeksto de-bias such models, or suppress potentially biased answers. With thisdemonstration, we take a different view on biases in instruction-tuning: Ratherthan aiming to suppress them, we aim to make them explicit and transparent. Tothis end, we present OpinionGPT, a web demo in which users can ask questionsand select all biases they wish to investigate. The demo will answer thisquestion using a model fine-tuned on text representing each of the selectedbiases, allowing side-by-side comparison. To train the underlying model, weidentified 11 different biases (political, geographic, gender, age) and derivedan instruction-tuning corpus in which each answer was written by members of oneof these demographics.

However, thetheoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorlyunderstood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, weexplore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\boldsymbol{X})=\langle\boldsymbol{Xv}, \texttt{softmax}(\boldsymbol{XWp})\rangle$, where$\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and$(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{W},\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. Weprove that running gradient descent on $\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently$\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution thatseparates $\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearlyformalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, ourresults are applicable to general data and precisely characterize$\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings$\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broaderregularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature ofattention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\boldsymbol{v}$and $\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditionsunder which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respectivehard-margin SVM solutions where $\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input featuresbased on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\boldsymbol{p}$is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, weverify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.</description><author>Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 18:24:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13596v3</guid></item><item><title>Non-inferiority of Deep Learning Acute Ischemic Stroke Segmentation on Non-Contrast CT Compared to Expert Neuroradiologists</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15341v3</link><description>To determine if a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model canaccurately segment acute ischemic changes on non-contrast CT compared toneuroradiologists. Non-contrast CT (NCCT) examinations from 232 acute ischemicstroke patients who were enrolled in the DEFUSE 3 trial were included in thisstudy. Three experienced neuroradiologists independently segmented hypodensitythat reflected the ischemic core on each scan. The neuroradiologist with themost experience (expert A) served as the ground truth for deep learning modeltraining. Two additional neuroradiologists (experts B and C) segmentations wereused for data testing. The 232 studies were randomly split into training andtest sets. The training set was further randomly divided into 5 folds withtraining and validation sets. A 3-dimensional CNN architecture was trained andoptimized to predict the segmentations of expert A from NCCT. The performanceof the model was assessed using a set of volume, overlap, and distance metricsusing non-inferiority thresholds of 20%, 3ml, and 3mm. The optimized modeltrained on expert A was compared to test experts B and C. We used a one-sidedWilcoxon signed-rank test to test for the non-inferiority of the model-expertcompared to the inter-expert agreement. The final model performance for theischemic core segmentation task reached a performance of 0.46+-0.09 SurfaceDice at Tolerance 5mm and 0.47+-0.13 Dice when trained on expert A. Compared tothe two test neuroradiologists the model-expert agreement was non-inferior tothe inter-expert agreement, p &lt; 0.05. The CNN accurately delineates thehypodense ischemic core on NCCT in acute ischemic stroke patients with anaccuracy comparable to neuroradiologists.</description><author>Sophie Ostmeier, Brian Axelrod, Benjamin F.

Despite these successes, their development faces two mainchallenges: (i) high computational cost; and (ii) difficulty in conducting fairand objective evaluations. LLMs are prohibitively expensive, making it feasiblefor only a few major players to undertake their training, thereby constrainingboth research and application opportunities. This underscores the importance ofcost-effective LLM training. In this paper, we utilize a growth strategy tosignificantly reduce LLM training cost. We demonstrate that an LLM with 101Bparameters and 0.31TB tokens can be trained on a $100K budget. We also adopt asystematic evaluation paradigm for the IQ evaluation of LLMs, in complement toexisting evaluations that focus more on knowledge-oriented abilities. Weintroduce our benchmark including evaluations on important aspects ofintelligence including symbolic mapping, itrule understanding, pattern mining,and anti-interference. Such evaluations minimize the potential impact ofmemorization. Experimental results show that our model FLM-101B, trained with abudget of $100K, achieves comparable performance to powerful and well-knownmodels, eg GPT-3 and GLM-130B, especially in the IQ benchmark evaluations withcontexts unseen in training data.

However, existing approaches often havelimitations; some focus only on ranking patients by survivability, neglectingto estimate the actual event time, while others treat the problem as aclassification task, ignoring the inherent time-ordered structure of theevents. Furthermore, the effective utilization of censored samples - trainingdata points where the exact event time is unknown - is essential for improvingthe predictive accuracy of the model. In this paper, we introduce CenTime, anovel approach to survival analysis that directly estimates the time to event.Our method features an innovative event-conditional censoring mechanism thatperforms robustly even when uncensored data is scarce. We demonstrate that ourapproach forms a consistent estimator for the event model parameters, even inthe absence of uncensored data. Furthermore, CenTime is easily integrated withdeep learning models with no restrictions on batch size or the number ofuncensored samples. We compare our approach with standard survival analysismethods, including the Cox proportional-hazard model and DeepHit. Our resultsindicate that CenTime offers state-of-the-art performance in predictingtime-to-death while maintaining comparable ranking performance.

In this work, we investigate the effect of a spikedcovariance structure and reveal several interesting phenomena. First, we showthat in the anisotropic setting, the commonly used spherical gradient dynamicsmay fail to recover the true direction, even when the spike is perfectlyaligned with the target direction. Next, we show that appropriate weightnormalization that is reminiscent of batch normalization can alleviate thisissue. Further, by exploiting the alignment between the (spiked) inputcovariance and the target, we obtain improved sample complexity compared to theisotropic case. In particular, under the spiked model with a suitably largespike, the sample complexity of gradient-based training can be made independentof the information exponent while also outperforming lower bounds forrotationally invariant kernel methods.</description><author>Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini, Denny Wu, Taiji Suzuki, Murat A.

Recent advances in human-in-the-loop machinelearning enable such systems to improve by interacting with users, but tend tobe limited by the amount of data that they can collect from individual users inpractice. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm toaddress this by training an interface to map raw command signals to actionsusing a combination of offline pre-training and online fine-tuning. To addressthe challenges posed by noisy command signals and sparse rewards, we develop anovel method for representing and inferring the user's long-term intent for agiven trajectory. We primarily evaluate our method's ability to assist userswho can only communicate through noisy, high-dimensional input channels througha user study in which 12 participants performed a simulated navigation task byusing their eye gaze to modulate a 128-dimensional command signal from theirwebcam. The results show that our method enables successful goal navigationmore often than a baseline directional interface, by learning to denoise usercommands signals and provide shared autonomy assistance. We further evaluate ona simulated Sawyer pushing task with eye gaze control, and the Lunar Landergame with simulated user commands, and find that our method improves overbaseline interfaces in these domains as well.

In medical imaging, MTL has shown great potential to solve varioustasks. However, existing MTL architectures in medical imaging are limited insharing information across tasks, reducing the potential performanceimprovements of MTL. In this study, we introduce a novel attention-based MTLframework to better leverage inter-task interactions for various tasks frompixel-level to image-level predictions. Specifically, we propose a Cross-TaskAttention Network (CTAN) which utilizes cross-task attention mechanisms toincorporate information by interacting across tasks. We validated CTAN on fourmedical imaging datasets that span different domains and tasks including:radiation treatment planning prediction using planning CT images of twodifferent target cancers (Prostate, OpenKBP); pigmented skin lesionsegmentation and diagnosis using dermatoscopic images (HAM10000); and COVID-19diagnosis and severity prediction using chest CT scans (STOIC). Our studydemonstrates the effectiveness of CTAN in improving the accuracy of medicalimaging tasks. Compared to standard single-task learning (STL), CTANdemonstrated a 4.67% improvement in performance and outperformed both widelyused MTL baselines: hard parameter sharing (HPS) with an average performanceimprovement of 3.22%; and multi-task attention network (MTAN) with a relativedecrease of 5.38%. These findings highlight the significance of our proposedMTL framework in solving medical imaging tasks and its potential to improvetheir accuracy across domains.</description><author>Sangwook Kim, Thomas G.

Recent progress in LfD often relies onkinesthetic teaching or teleoperation as the medium for users to specify thedemonstrations. Kinesthetic teaching requires physical handling of the robot,while teleoperation demands proficiency with additional hardware. This paperintroduces an alternative paradigm for LfD called Diagrammatic Teaching.Diagrammatic Teaching aims to teach robots novel skills by prompting the userto sketch out demonstration trajectories on 2D images of the scene, these arethen synthesised as a generative model of motion trajectories in 3D task space.Additionally, we present the Ray-tracing Probabilistic Trajectory Learning(RPTL) framework for Diagrammatic Teaching. RPTL extracts time-varyingprobability densities from the 2D sketches, applies ray-tracing to findcorresponding regions in 3D Cartesian space, and fits a probabilistic model ofmotion trajectories to these regions. New motion trajectories, which mimicthose sketched by the user, can then be generated from the probabilistic model.We empirically validate our framework both in simulation and on real robots,which include a fixed-base manipulator and a quadruped-mounted manipulator.</description><author>Weiming Zhi, Tianyi Zhang, Matthew Johnson-Roberson</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 17:49:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03835v1</guid></item><item><title>Auto-SDE: Learning effective reduced dynamics from data-driven stochastic dynamical systems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04151v2</link><description>Multiscale stochastic dynamical systems have been widely adopted toscientific and engineering problems due to their capability of depictingcomplex phenomena in many real world applications.

However,supervised drift detection methods require human annotation and consequentlylead to a longer time to detect and mitigate the drift. In our proposedunsupervised drift detection method, we follow a two step process. Our firststep involves encoding a sample of production data as the target distribution,and the model training data as the reference distribution. In the second step,we employ a kernel-based statistical test that utilizes the maximum meandiscrepancy (MMD) distance metric to compare the reference and targetdistributions and estimate any potential drift.

Numerous solutions have beenproposed such as normalisation techniques or limiting activation functions tolinear rectifying units. In this work we follow a different approach which isparticularly applicable to closed-loop learning of forward models whereback-propagation makes exclusive use of the sign of the error signal to primethe learning, whilst a global relevance signal modulates the rate of learning.This is inspired by the interaction between local plasticity and a globalneuromodulation. For example, whilst driving on an empty road, one can allowfor slow step-wise optimisation of actions, whereas, at a busy junction, anerror must be corrected at once. Hence, the error is the priming signal and theintensity of the experience is a modulating factor in the weight change. Theadvantages of this Prime and Modulate paradigm is twofold: it is free fromnormalisation and it makes use of relevant cues from the environment to enrichthe learning.

However,there is a mismatch between the distributions of cases and difficulty level ofsegmentation tasks in public data sets compared to clinical practice. Commonmetrics fail to measure the impact of this mismatch, especially for clinicaldata sets that include low signal pathologies, a difficult segmentation task,and uncertain, small, or empty reference annotations. This limitation mayresult in ineffective research of machine learning practitioners in designingand optimizing models. Dimensions of evaluating clinical value includeconsideration of the uncertainty of reference annotations, independence fromreference annotation volume size, and evaluation of classification of emptyreference annotations. We study how uncertain, small, and empty referenceannotations influence the value of metrics for medical image segmentation on anin-house data set regardless of the model. We examine metrics behavior on thepredictions of a standard deep learning framework in order to identify metricswith clinical value. We compare to a public benchmark data set (BraTS 2019)with a high-signal pathology and certain, larger, and no empty referenceannotations. We may show machine learning practitioners, how uncertain, small,or empty reference annotations require a rethinking of the evaluation andoptimizing procedures.

The training of an efficacious deep learning model requires largedata with diverse styles and qualities. The diversity of data often comes fromthe use of various scanners of vendors. But, in practice, it is impractical tocollect a sufficient amount of diverse data for training. To this end, a novelcontrastive learning is developed to equip the deep learning models with betterstyle generalization capability. Specifically, the multi-style and multi-viewunsupervised self-learning scheme is carried out to seek robust featureembedding against style diversity as a pretrained model. Afterward, thepretrained network is further fine-tuned to the downstream tasks, e.g., massdetection, matching, BI-RADS rating, and breast density classification. Theproposed method has been evaluated extensively and rigorously with mammogramsfrom various vendor style domains and several public datasets. The experimentalresults suggest that the proposed domain generalization method can effectivelyimprove performance of four mammographic image tasks on the data from both seenand unseen domains, and outperform many state-of-the-art (SOTA) generalizationmethods.</description><author>Zheren Li, Zhiming Cui, Lichi Zhang, Sheng Wang, Chenjin Lei, Xi Ouyang, Dongdong Chen, Xiangyu Zhao, Yajia Gu, Zaiyi Liu, Chunling Liu, Dinggang Shen, Jie-Zhi Cheng</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 17:16:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10226v5</guid></item><item><title>Empirical Risk Minimization for Losses without Variance</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03818v1</link><description>This paper considers an empirical risk minimization problem underheavy-tailed settings, where data does not have finite variance, but only has$p$-th moment with $p \in (1,2)$. Instead of using estimation procedure basedon truncated observed data, we choose the optimizer by minimizing the riskvalue. Those risk values can be robustly estimated via using the remarkableCatoni's method (Catoni, 2012). Thanks to the structure of Catoni-typeinfluence functions, we are able to establish excess risk upper bounds viausing generalized generic chaining methods. Moreover, we take computationalissues into consideration. We especially theoretically investigate two types ofoptimization methods, robust gradient descent algorithm and empiricalrisk-based methods. With an extensive numerical study, we find that theoptimizer based on empirical risks via Catoni-style estimation indeed showsbetter performance than other baselines. It indicates that estimation directlybased on truncated data may lead to unsatisfactory results.</description><author>Guanhua Fang, Ping Li, Gennady Samorodnitsky</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 17:14:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03818v1</guid></item><item><title>Global Optimization for Cardinality-constrained Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering via Semidefinite Programming</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08901v3</link><description>The minimum sum-of-squares clustering (MSSC), or k-means type clustering, hasbeen recently extended to exploit prior knowledge on the cardinality of eachcluster. Such knowledge is used to increase performance as well as solutionquality. In this paper, we propose a global optimization approach based on thebranch-and-cut technique to solve the cardinality-constrained MSSC. For thelower bound routine, we use the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxationrecently proposed by Rujeerapaiboon et al. [SIAM J. Optim. 29(2), 1211-1239,(2019)]. However, this relaxation can be used in a branch-and-cut method onlyfor small-size instances. Therefore, we derive a new SDP relaxation that scalesbetter with the instance size and the number of clusters. In both cases, westrengthen the bound by adding polyhedral cuts. Benefiting from a tailoredbranching strategy which enforces pairwise constraints, we reduce thecomplexity of the problems arising in the children nodes. For the upper bound,instead, we present a local search procedure that exploits the solution of theSDP relaxation solved at each node. Computational results show that theproposed algorithm globally solves, for the first time, real-world instances ofsize 10 times larger than those solved by state-of-the-art exact methods.</description><author>Veronica Piccialli, Antonio M.

Unfortunately, this hasalso led to an increase in privacy violations and the spread of falseinformation, which requires the need for traceability, privacy protection, andother security measures. However, existing text-to-image paradigms lack thetechnical capabilities to link traceable messages with image generation. Inthis study, we introduce a novel task for the joint generation of text to imageand watermark (T2IW). This T2IW scheme ensures minimal damage to image qualitywhen generating a compound image by forcing the semantic feature and thewatermark signal to be compatible in pixels. Additionally, by utilizingprinciples from Shannon information theory and non-cooperative game theory, weare able to separate the revealed image and the revealed watermark from thecompound image. Furthermore, we strengthen the watermark robustness of ourapproach by subjecting the compound image to various post-processing attacks,with minimal pixel distortion observed in the revealed watermark. Extensiveexperiments have demonstrated remarkable achievements in image quality,watermark invisibility, and watermark robustness, supported by our proposed setof evaluation metrics.</description><author>An-An Liu, Guokai Zhang, Yuting Su, Ning Xu, Yongdong Zhang, Lanjun Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 17:12:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03815v1</guid></item><item><title>AnthroNet: Conditional Generation of Humans via Anthropometrics</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03812v1</link><description>We present a novel human body model formulated by an extensive set ofanthropocentric measurements, which is capable of generating a wide range ofhuman body shapes and poses.

Traditional motionestimation techniques fail in such conditions, suffering from too much blur inthe presence of high-speed motion and strong noise in low-light conditions.Single-photon cameras have recently emerged as a promising technology capableof capturing hundreds of thousands of photon frames per second thanks to theirhigh speed and extreme sensitivity. Unfortunately, traditional computer visiontechniques are not well suited for dealing with the binary-valued photon datacaptured by these cameras because these are corrupted by extreme Poisson noise.Here we present a method capable of estimating extreme scene motion underchallenging conditions, such as low light or high dynamic range, from asequence of high-speed image frames such as those captured by a single-photoncamera. Our method relies on iteratively improving a motion estimate bygrouping and aggregating frames after-the-fact, in a stratified manner. Wedemonstrate the creation of high-quality panoramas under fast motion andextremely low light, and super-resolution results using a custom single-photoncamera prototype.

This problem, known as rank aggregation,has found many applications in sports, recommendation systems, and other webapplications. As it is generally NP-hard to find a global ranking thatminimizes the mismatch (known as the Kemeny optimization), we focus on theErd\"os-R\'enyi outliers (ERO) model for this ranking problem. Here, eachpairwise comparison is a corrupted copy of the true score difference. Weinvestigate spectral ranking algorithms that are based on unnormalized andnormalized data matrices. The key is to understand their performance inrecovering the underlying scores of each item from the observed data. Thisreduces to deriving an entry-wise perturbation error bound between the topeigenvectors of the unnormalized/normalized data matrix and its populationcounterpart. By using the leave-one-out technique, we provide a sharper$\ell_{\infty}$-norm perturbation bound of the eigenvectors and also derive anerror bound on the maximum displacement for each item, with only $\Omega(n\logn)$ samples.

Unlike conventional FL which trains a single globalconsensus model, personalized FL allows different models for different clients.However, existing personalized FL algorithms only implicitly transfer thecollaborative knowledge across the federation by embedding the knowledge intothe aggregated model or regularization. We observed that this implicitknowledge transfer fails to maximize the potential of each client's empiricalrisk toward other clients. Based on our observation, in this work, we proposePersonalized Global Federated Learning (PGFed), a novel personalized FLframework that enables each client to personalize its own global objective byexplicitly and adaptively aggregating the empirical risks of itself and otherclients. To avoid massive (O(N^2)) communication overhead and potential privacyleakage while achieving this, each client's risk is estimated through afirst-order approximation for other clients' adaptive risk aggregation. On topof PGFed, we develop a momentum upgrade, dubbed PGFedMo, to more efficientlyutilize clients' empirical risks. Our extensive experiments on four datasetsunder different federated settings show consistent improvements of PGFed overprevious state-of-the-art methods.

Once trained,GraPhSyM provides accurate visibility of final design metrics to early EDAstages, such as logic synthesis, without running the slow physical synthesisflow, enabling global co-optimization across stages. Additionally, the swiftand precise feedback provided by GraPhSyM is instrumental formachine-learning-based EDA optimization frameworks. Given a gate-level netlistof a circuit represented as a graph, GraPhSyM utilizes graph structure,connectivity, and electrical property features to predict the impact ofphysical synthesis transformations such as buffer insertion and gate sizing.When trained on a dataset of 6000 prefix adder designs synthesized at anaggressive delay target, GraPhSyM can accurately predict the post-synthesisdelay (98.3%) and area (96.1%) metrics of unseen adders with a fast 0.22sinference time. Furthermore, we illustrate the compositionality of GraPhSyM byemploying the model trained on a fixed delay target to accurately anticipatepost-synthesis metrics at a variety of unseen delay targets. Lastly, we reportpromising generalization capabilities of the GraPhSyM model when it isevaluated on circuits different from the adders it was exclusively trained on.The results show the potential for GraPhSyM to serve as a powerful tool foradvanced optimization techniques and as an oracle for EDA machine learningframeworks.</description><author>Ahmed Agiza, Rajarshi Roy, Teodor Dumitru Ene, Saad Godil, Sherief Reda, Bryan Catanzaro</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 16:59:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03944v2</guid></item><item><title>From DDMs to DNNs: Using process data and models of decision-making to improve human-AI interactions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15225v2</link><description>Over the past decades, cognitive neuroscientists and behavioral economistshave recognized the value of describing the process of decision making indetail and modeling the emergence of decisions over time.

We begin by consideringoffline sparse parity learning, a supervised classification problem whichadmits a statistical query lower bound for gradient-based training of amultilayer perceptron. This lower bound can be interpreted as a multi-resourcetradeoff frontier: successful learning can only occur if one is sufficientlyrich (large model), knowledgeable (large dataset), patient (many trainingiterations), or lucky (many random guesses). We show, theoretically andexperimentally, that sparse initialization and increasing network width yieldsignificant improvements in sample efficiency in this setting. Here, widthplays the role of parallel search: it amplifies the probability of finding"lottery ticket" neurons, which learn sparse features more sample-efficiently.Finally, we show that the synthetic sparse parity task can be useful as a proxyfor real problems requiring axis-aligned feature learning.

As more data iscollected, privacy concerns regarding it increase, including but not limited topedestrian faces and surrounding vehicle license plates. Normal and fisheyecameras are the two common camera types that are typically mounted oncollection vehicles. With complex camera distortion models, fisheye cameraimages were deformed in contrast to regular images. It causes computer visiontasks to perform poorly when using numerous deep learning models.

We first study the limitations of the existing Linuxbuilt-in methods used in small devices. We illustrate three typicalworkload/system patterns that are challenging to manage with Linux's built-insolutions. We develop a reinforcement-learning-based technique with temporalencoding to derive an effective DVFS governor even with the presence of thethree system patterns. The derived governor uses only one performance counter,the same as the built-in Linux mechanism, and does not require an explicit taskmodel for the workload. We implemented a prototype system on the Nvidia JetsonNano Board and experimented with it with six applications, including twoself-designed and four benchmark applications. Under different deadlineconstraints, our approach can quickly derive a DVFS governor that can adapt toperformance requirements and outperform the built-in Linux approach in energysaving. On Mibench workloads, with performance slack ranging from 0.04 s to 0.4s, the proposed method can save 3% - 11% more energy compared to Ondemand.AudioReg and FaceReg applications tested have 5%- 14% energy-savingimprovement.

In order to achieve safety of AD systems with DNN-based perception componentsin a systematic and comprehensive approach, so-called safety concerns have beenintroduced as a suitable structuring element. On the one hand, the concept ofsafety concerns is -- by design -- well aligned to existing standards relevantfor safety of AD systems such as ISO 21448 (SOTIF). On the other hand, it hasalready inspired several academic publications and upcoming standards on AIsafety such as ISO PAS 8800. While the concept of safety concerns has been previously introduced, thispaper extends and refines it, leveraging feedback from various domain andsafety experts in the field. In particular, this paper introduces an additionalcategorization for a better understanding as well as enabling cross-functionalteams to jointly address the concerns.</description><author>Stephanie Abrecht, Alexander Hirsch, Shervin Raafatnia, Matthias Woehrle</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 16:25:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03774v1</guid></item><item><title>Extending Transductive Knowledge Graph Embedding Models for Inductive Logical Relational Inference</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03773v1</link><description>Many downstream inference tasks for knowledge graphs, such as relationprediction, have been handled successfully by knowledge graph embeddingtechniques in the transductive setting. To address the inductive settingwherein new entities are introduced into the knowledge graph at inference time,more recent work opts for models which learn implicit representations of theknowledge graph through a complex function of a network's subgraph structure,often parametrized by graph neural network architectures. These come at thecost of increased parametrization, reduced interpretability and limitedgeneralization to other downstream inference tasks. In this work, we bridge thegap between traditional transductive knowledge graph embedding approaches andmore recent inductive relation prediction models by introducing a generalizedform of harmonic extension which leverages representations learned throughtransductive embedding methods to infer representations of new entitiesintroduced at inference time as in the inductive setting. This harmonicextension technique provides the best such approximation, can be implementedvia an efficient iterative scheme, and can be employed to answer a family ofconjunctive logical queries over the knowledge graph, further expanding thecapabilities of transductive embedding methods. In experiments on a number oflarge-scale knowledge graph embedding benchmarks, we find that this approachfor extending the functionality of transductive knowledge graph embeddingmodels to perform knowledge graph completion and answer logical queries in theinductive setting is competitive with--and in some scenariosoutperforms--several state-of-the-art models derived explicitly for suchinductive tasks.</description><author>Thomas Gebhart, John Cobb</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 16:24:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03773v1</guid></item><item><title>Natural and Robust Walking using Reinforcement Learning without Demonstrations in High-Dimensional Musculoskeletal Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02976v2</link><description>Humans excel at robust bipedal walking in complex natural environments. Ineach step, they adequately tune the interaction of biomechanical muscledynamics and neuronal signals to be robust against uncertainties in groundconditions. However, it is still not fully understood how the nervous systemresolves the musculoskeletal redundancy to solve the multi-objective controlproblem considering stability, robustness, and energy efficiency. In computersimulations, energy minimization has been shown to be a successful optimizationtarget, reproducing natural walking with trajectory optimization orreflex-based control methods. However, these methods focus on particularmotions at a time and the resulting controllers are limited when compensatingfor perturbations. In robotics, reinforcement learning~(RL) methods recentlyachieved highly stable (and efficient) locomotion on quadruped systems, but thegeneration of human-like walking with bipedal biomechanical models has requiredextensive use of expert data sets. This strong reliance on demonstrations oftenresults in brittle policies and limits the application to new behaviors,especially considering the potential variety of movements for high-dimensionalmusculoskeletal models in 3D. Achieving natural locomotion with RL withoutsacrificing its incredible robustness might pave the way for a novel approachto studying human walking in complex natural environments.

In this article, the statistical techniquelasso for variable selection is represented through a neural network. It isobserved that, although both the statistical approach and its neural versionhave the same objective function, they differ due to their optimization. Inparticular, the neural version is usually optimized in one-step using a singlevalidation set, while the statistical counterpart uses a two-step optimizationbased on cross-validation. The more elaborated optimization of the statisticalmethod results in more accurate parameter estimation, especially when thetraining set is small. For this reason, a modification of the standard approachfor training neural networks, that mimics the statistical framework, isproposed. During the development of the above modification, a new optimizationalgorithm for identifying the significant variables emerged.

This new approach reduces computational complexity by avoiding theneed to calculate the QSVD of large quaternion matrices. We also present twoimprovements to the QLNM-QQR method: an enhanced version called IRQLNM-QQR thatuses iteratively reweighted quaternion $L_{2,1}$-norm minimization and a methodcalled QLNM-QQR-SR that integrates sparse regularization. Our experiments onnatural color images and color medical images show that IRQLNM-QQR outperformsQLNM-QQR and that the proposed QLNM-QQR-SR method is superior to severalstate-of-the-art methods.</description><author>Juan Han, Kit Ian Kou, Jifei Miao, Lizhi Liu, Haojiang Li</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 16:08:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03764v1</guid></item><item><title>dacl1k: Real-World Bridge Damage Dataset Putting Open-Source Data to the Test</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03763v1</link><description>Recognising reinforced concrete defects (RCDs) is a crucial element fordetermining the structural integrity, traffic safety and durability of bridges.However, most of the existing datasets in the RCD domain are derived from asmall number of bridges acquired in specific camera poses, lighting conditionsand with fixed hardware. These limitations question the usability of modelstrained on such open-source data in real-world scenarios. We address thisproblem by testing such models on our "dacl1k" dataset, a highly diverse RCDdataset for multi-label classification based on building inspections including1,474 images. Thereby, we trained the models on different combinations ofopen-source data (meta datasets) which were subsequently evaluated bothextrinsically and intrinsically.

Asthese LLMs are deployed for increasingly complex tasks, they often face theneed to conduct longer reasoning processes or understand larger contexts. Inthese situations, the length generalization failure of LLMs on long sequencesbecomes more prominent. Most pre-training schemes truncate training sequencesto a fixed length. LLMs often struggle to generate fluent and coherent texts,let alone carry out downstream tasks, after longer contexts, even with relativepositional encoding designed to cope with this problem. Common solutions suchas finetuning on longer corpora often involve daunting hardware and time costsand require careful training process design. To more efficiently leverage thegeneration capacity of existing LLMs, we theoretically and empiricallyinvestigate the main out-of-distribution (OOD) factors contributing to thisproblem. Inspired by this diagnosis, we propose a simple yet effective solutionfor on-the-fly length generalization, LM-Infinite. It involves only a$\Lambda$-shaped attention mask (to avoid excessive attended tokens) and adistance limit (to avoid unseen distances) while requiring no parameter updatesor learning. We find it applicable to a variety of LLMs using relative-positionencoding methods. LM-Infinite is computationally efficient with $O(n)$ time andspace, and demonstrates consistent text generation fluency and quality to aslong as 32k tokens on ArXiv and OpenWebText2 datasets, with 2.72x decodingspeedup. On downstream tasks such as passkey retrieval, it continues to work oninputs much longer than training lengths where vanilla models fail immediately.</description><author>Chi Han, Qifan Wang, Wenhan Xiong, Yu Chen, Heng Ji, Sinong Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 16:04:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16137v3</guid></item><item><title>M(otion)-mode Based Prediction of Ejection Fraction using Echocardiograms</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03759v1</link><description>Early detection of cardiac dysfunction through routine screening is vital fordiagnosing cardiovascular diseases. An important metric of cardiac function isthe left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), where lower EF is associated withcardiomyopathy. Echocardiography is a popular diagnostic tool in cardiology,with ultrasound being a low-cost, real-time, and non-ionizing technology.However, human assessment of echocardiograms for calculating EF istime-consuming and expertise-demanding, raising the need for an automatedapproach. In this work, we propose using the M(otion)-mode of echocardiogramsfor estimating the EF and classifying cardiomyopathy. We generate multipleartificial M-mode images from a single echocardiogram and combine them usingoff-the-shelf model architectures. Additionally, we extend contrastive learning(CL) to cardiac imaging to learn meaningful representations from exploitingstructures in unlabeled data allowing the model to achieve high accuracy, evenwith limited annotations. Our experiments show that the supervised settingconverges with only ten modes and is comparable to the baseline method whilebypassing its cumbersome training process and being computationally much moreefficient. Furthermore, CL using M-mode images is helpful for limited datascenarios, such as having labels for only 200 patients, which is common inmedical applications.</description><author>Ece Ozkan, Thomas M.

However, they suffer from slow convergence, suboptimal convergedresults, and overfittings. This paper introduces a hybrid algorithm for roboticmotion planning: long short-term memory (LSTM) pooling and skip connection forattention-based discrete soft actor critic (LSA-DSAC).

Despite its versatility andexcellent performance, the optimization of large models via SGD still is atime-consuming task. To reduce training time, it is common to distribute thetraining process across multiple devices. Recently, it has been shown that theconvergence of asynchronous SGD (ASGD) will always be faster than mini-batchSGD. However, despite these improvements in the theoretical bounds, most ASGDconvergence-rate proofs still rely on a centralized parameter server, which isprone to become a bottleneck when scaling out the gradient computations acrossmany distributed processes. In this paper, we present a novel convergence-rate analysis for decentralizedand asynchronous SGD (DASGD) which does not require partial synchronizationamong nodes nor restrictive network topologies. Specifically, we provide abound of $\mathcal{O}(\sigma\epsilon^{-2}) +\mathcal{O}(QS_{avg}\epsilon^{-3/2}) + \mathcal{O}(S_{avg}\epsilon^{-1})$ forthe convergence rate of DASGD, where $S_{avg}$ is the average staleness betweenmodels, $Q$ is a constant that bounds the norm of the gradients, and $\epsilon$is a (small) error that is allowed within the bound. Furthermore, whengradients are not bounded, we prove the convergence rate of DASGD to be$\mathcal{O}(\sigma\epsilon^{-2}) +\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\hat{S}_{avg}\hat{S}_{max}}\epsilon^{-1})$, with$\hat{S}_{max}$ and $\hat{S}_{avg}$ representing a loose version of the averageand maximum staleness, respectively. Our convergence proof holds for a fixedstepsize and any non-convex, homogeneous, and L-smooth objective function. Weanticipate that our results will be of high relevance for the adoption of DASGDby a broad community of researchers and developers.</description><author>Mauro DL Tosi, Martin Theobald</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 15:50:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03754v1</guid></item><item><title>Medoid Silhouette clustering with automatic cluster number selection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03751v1</link><description>The evaluation of clustering results is difficult, highly dependent on theevaluated data set and the perspective of the beholder.

Goal-based predictionmodels simplify multimodal prediction by first predicting 2D goal locations ofagents and then predicting trajectories conditioned on each goal. However, asingle 2D goal location serves as a weak inductive bias for predicting thewhole trajectory, often leading to poor map compliance, i.e., part of thetrajectory going off-road or breaking traffic rules. In this paper, we improveupon goal-based prediction by proposing the Path-based prediction (PBP)approach. PBP predicts a discrete probability distribution over reference pathsin the HD map using the path features and predicts trajectories in thepath-relative Frenet frame.

However, many commercialconversational agent development tools are pipeline-based and have limitationsin holding a human-like conversation. This paper investigates the capabilitiesof LLMs to enhance pipeline-based conversational agents during two phases: 1)in the design and development phase and 2) during operations. In 1) LLMs canaid in generating training data, extracting entities and synonyms,localization, and persona design. In 2) LLMs can assist in contextualization,intent classification to prevent conversational breakdown and handleout-of-scope questions, auto-correcting utterances, rephrasing responses,formulating disambiguation questions, summarization, and enabling closedquestion-answering capabilities. We conducted informal experiments with GPT-4in the private banking domain to demonstrate the scenarios above with apractical example. Companies may be hesitant to replace their pipeline-basedagents with LLMs entirely due to privacy concerns and the need for deepintegration within their existing ecosystems. A hybrid approach in which LLMs'are integrated into the pipeline-based agents allows them to save time andcosts of building and running agents by capitalizing on the capabilities ofLLMs while retaining the integration and privacy safeguards of their existingsystems.</description><author>Mina Foosherian, Hendrik Purwins, Purna Rathnayake, Touhidul Alam, Rui Teimao, Klaus-Dieter Thoben</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 15:43:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03748v1</guid></item><item><title>The Daunting Dilemma with Sentence Encoders: Success on Standard Benchmarks, Failure in Capturing Basic Semantic Properties</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03747v1</link><description>In this paper, we adopted a retrospective approach to examine and comparefive existing popular sentence encoders, i.e., Sentence-BERT, UniversalSentence Encoder (USE), LASER, InferSent, and Doc2vec, in terms of theirperformance on downstream tasks versus their capability to capture basicsemantic properties. Initially, we evaluated all five sentence encoders on thepopular SentEval benchmark and found that multiple sentence encoders performquite well on a variety of popular downstream tasks. However, being unable tofind a single winner in all cases, we designed further experiments to gain adeeper understanding of their behavior. Specifically, we proposed four semanticevaluation criteria, i.e., Paraphrasing, Synonym Replacement, AntonymReplacement, and Sentence Jumbling, and evaluated the same five sentenceencoders using these criteria. We found that the Sentence-Bert and USE modelspass the paraphrasing criterion, with SBERT being the superior between the two.LASER dominates in the case of the synonym replacement criterion.Interestingly, all the sentence encoders failed the antonym replacement andjumbling criteria.

However, training deeplearning-based methods requires a large amount of pixel-wise annotated data,which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially in 3D images. Analternative approach is to adapt weak-annotation methods, such as labeling eachnucleus with a point, but this method does not extend from 2D histopathologyimages (for which it was originally developed) to 3D immunofluorescent images.The reason is that 3D images contain multiple channels (z-axis) for nuclei anddifferent markers separately, which makes training using point annotationsdifficult. To address this challenge, we propose the Label-efficientContrastive learning-based (LECL) model to detect and classify various types ofnuclei in 3D immunofluorescent images. Previous methods use Maximum IntensityProjection (MIP) to convert immunofluorescent images with multiple slices to 2Dimages, which can cause signals from different z-stacks to falsely appearassociated with each other. To overcome this, we devised an Extended MaximumIntensity Projection (EMIP) approach that addresses issues using MIP.Furthermore, we performed a Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) approach forweakly supervised settings. We conducted experiments on cardiovascular datasetsand found that our proposed framework is effective and efficient in detectingand classifying various types of nuclei in 3D immunofluorescent images.</description><author>Nazanin Moradinasab, Rebecca A.

This makes thempreferable to use in autonomous vehicles' perception systems, especially as thecombined cost of both sensors is cheaper than the cost of a lidar. Recentradar-camera methods commonly perform feature-level fusion which often involvesprojecting the radar points onto the same plane as the image features andfusing the extracted features from both modalities. While performing fusion onthe image plane is generally simpler and faster, projecting radar points ontothe image plane flattens the depth dimension of the point cloud which mightlead to information loss and makes extracting the spatial features of the pointcloud harder. We proposed ClusterFusion, an architecture that leverages thelocal spatial features of the radar point cloud by clustering the point cloudand performing feature extraction directly on the point cloud clusters beforeprojecting the features onto the image plane. ClusterFusion achieved thestate-of-the-art performance among all radar-monocular camera methods on thetest slice of the nuScenes dataset with 48.7% nuScenes detection score (NDS).We also investigated the performance of different radar feature extractionstrategies on point cloud clusters: a handcrafted strategy, a learning-basedstrategy, and a combination of both, and found that the handcrafted strategyyielded the best performance.

Such effects, also known ascontinuous-valued treatment effects, are typically estimated from observationaldata, which may be subject to dose selection bias. This means that theallocation of doses depends on pre-treatment covariates. Previous studies haveshown that conventional machine learning approaches fail to learn accurateindividual estimates of dose responses under the presence of dose selectionbias. In this work, we propose CBRNet, a causal machine learning approach toestimate an individual dose response from observational data. CBRNet adopts theNeyman-Rubin potential outcome framework and extends the concept of balancedrepresentation learning for overcoming selection bias to continuous-valuedtreatments. Our work is the first to apply representation balancing in acontinuous-valued treatment setting. We evaluate our method on a newly proposedbenchmark. Our experiments demonstrate CBRNet's ability to accurately learntreatment effects under selection bias and competitive performance with respectto other state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>Christopher Bockel-Rickermann, Toon Vanderschueren, Jeroen Berrevoets, Tim Verdonck, Wouter Verbeke</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 15:17:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03731v1</guid></item><item><title>A Causal Perspective on Loan Pricing: Investigating the Impacts of Selection Bias on Identifying Bid-Response Functions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03730v1</link><description>In lending, where prices are specific to both customers and products, havinga well-functioning personalized pricing policy in place is essential toeffective business making. Typically, such a policy must be derived fromobservational data, which introduces several challenges. While the problem of``endogeneity'' is prominently studied in the established pricing literature,the problem of selection bias (or, more precisely, bid selection bias) is not.We take a step towards understanding the effects of selection bias by posingpricing as a problem of causal inference. Specifically, we consider thereaction of a customer to price a treatment effect. In our experiments, wesimulate varying levels of selection bias on a semi-synthetic dataset onmortgage loan applications in Belgium. We investigate the potential ofparametric and nonparametric methods for the identification of individualbid-response functions. Our results illustrate how conventional methods such aslogistic regression and neural networks suffer adversely from selection bias.In contrast, we implement state-of-the-art methods from causal machine learningand show their capability to overcome selection bias in pricing data.</description><author>Christopher Bockel-Rickermann, Sam Verboven, Tim Verdonck, Wouter Verbeke</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 15:14:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03730v1</guid></item><item><title>Phasic Content Fusing Diffusion Model with Directional Distribution Consistency for Few-Shot Model Adaption</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03729v1</link><description>Training a generative model with limited number of samples is a challengingtask. Current methods primarily rely on few-shot model adaption to train thenetwork. However, in scenarios where data is extremely limited (less than 10),the generative network tends to overfit and suffers from content degradation.To address these problems, we propose a novel phasic content fusing few-shotdiffusion model with directional distribution consistency loss, which targetsdifferent learning objectives at distinct training stages of the diffusionmodel. Specifically, we design a phasic training strategy with phasic contentfusion to help our model learn content and style information when t is large,and learn local details of target domain when t is small, leading to animprovement in the capture of content, style and local details. Furthermore, weintroduce a novel directional distribution consistency loss that ensures theconsistency between the generated and source distributions more efficiently andstably than the prior methods, preventing our model from overfitting. Finally,we propose a cross-domain structure guidance strategy that enhances structureconsistency during domain adaptation. Theoretical analysis, qualitative andquantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach infew-shot generative model adaption tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.The source code is available at:https://github.com/sjtuplayer/few-shot-diffusion.</description><author>Teng Hu, Jiangning Zhang, Liang Liu, Ran Yi, Siqi Kou, Haokun Zhu, Xu Chen, Yabiao Wang, Chengjie Wang, Lizhuang Ma</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 15:14:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03729v1</guid></item><item><title>Interpretable Visual Question Answering via Reasoning Supervision</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03726v1</link><description>Transformer-based architectures have recently demonstrated remarkableperformance in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. However, such modelsare likely to disregard crucial visual cues and often rely on multimodalshortcuts and inherent biases of the language modality to predict the correctanswer, a phenomenon commonly referred to as lack of visual grounding. In thiswork, we alleviate this shortcoming through a novel architecture for visualquestion answering that leverages common sense reasoning as a supervisorysignal. Reasoning supervision takes the form of a textual justification of thecorrect answer, with such annotations being already available on large-scaleVisual Common Sense Reasoning (VCR) datasets. The model's visual attention isguided toward important elements of the scene through a similarity loss thataligns the learned attention distributions guided by the question and thecorrect reasoning. We demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively thatthe proposed approach can boost the model's visual perception capability andlead to performance increase, without requiring training on explicit groundingannotations.</description><author>Maria Parelli, Dimitrios Mallis, Markos Diomataris, Vassilis Pitsikalis</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 15:12:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03726v1</guid></item><item><title>Truncated Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Diffusion-based Adversarial Auto-Encoders</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09671v4</link><description>Employing a forward diffusion chain to gradually map the data to a noisedistribution, diffusion-based generative models learn how to generate the databy inferring a reverse diffusion chain.

We propose a faster andcheaper approach that adds noise not until the data become pure random noise,but until they reach a hidden noisy data distribution that we can confidentlylearn. Then, we use fewer reverse steps to generate data by starting from thishidden distribution that is made similar to the noisy data.

One of the key issues of planesegmentation is how to design powerful features that can exactly distinguishadjacent planar patches. The quality of point feature directly determines theaccuracy of roof plane segmentation. Most of existing approaches usehandcrafted features to extract roof planes. However, the abilities of thesefeatures are relatively low, especially in boundary area. To solve thisproblem, we propose a boundary-aware point clustering approach in Euclidean andembedding spaces constructed by a multi-task deep network for roof planesegmentation. We design a three-branch network to predict semantic labels,point offsets and extract deep embedding features. In the first branch, weclassify the input data as non-roof, boundary and plane points. In the secondbranch, we predict point offsets for shifting each point toward its respectiveinstance center. In the third branch, we constrain that points of the sameplane instance should have the similar embeddings. We aim to ensure that pointsof the same plane instance are close as much as possible in both Euclidean andembedding spaces. However, although deep network has strong featurerepresentative ability, it is still hard to accurately distinguish points nearplane instance boundary. Therefore, we first group plane points into manyclusters in the two spaces, and then we assign the rest boundary points totheir closest clusters to generate final complete roof planes. In this way, wecan effectively reduce the influence of unreliable boundary points. Inaddition, we construct a synthetic dataset and a real dataset to train andevaluate our approach. The experiments results show that the proposed approachsignificantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description><author>Li Li, Qingqing Li, Guozheng Xu, Pengwei Zhou, Jingmin Tu, Jie Li, Jian Yao</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 14:58:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03722v1</guid></item><item><title>A Natural Gas Consumption Forecasting System for Continual Learning Scenarios based on Hoeffding Trees with Change Point Detection Mechanism</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03720v1</link><description>Forecasting natural gas consumption, considering seasonality and trends, iscrucial in planning its supply and consumption and optimizing the cost ofobtaining it, mainly by industrial entities. However, in times of threats toits supply, it is also a critical element that guarantees the supply of thisraw material to meet individual consumers' needs, ensuring society's energysecurity. This article introduces a novel multistep ahead forecasting ofnatural gas consumption with change point detection integration for modelcollection selection with continual learning capabilities using data streamprocessing. The performance of the forecasting models based on the proposedapproach is evaluated in a complex real-world use case of natural gasconsumption forecasting. We employed Hoeffding tree predictors as forecastingmodels and the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm for the change pointdetection procedure. The change point detection integration enables selecting adifferent model collection for successive time frames. Thus, three modelcollection selection procedures (with and without an error feedback loop) aredefined and evaluated for forecasting scenarios with various densities ofdetected change points. These models were compared with change point agnosticbaseline approaches. Our experiments show that fewer change points result in alower forecasting error regardless of the model collection selection procedureemployed. Also, simpler model collection selection procedures omittingforecasting error feedback leads to more robust forecasting models suitable forcontinual learning tasks.</description><author>Radek Svoboda, Sebastian Basterrech, Jędrzej Kozal, Jan Platoš, Michał Woźniak</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 14:52:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03720v1</guid></item><item><title>Enhancing Deep Learning Models through Tensorization: A Comprehensive Survey and Framework</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02428v2</link><description>The burgeoning growth of public domain data and the increasing complexity ofdeep learning model architectures have underscored the need for more efficientdata representation and analysis techniques.

This transformative approach bridges the gap between theinherently multidimensional nature of data and the simplified 2-dimensionalmatrices commonly used in linear algebra-based machine learning algorithms.This paper explores the steps involved in tensorization, multidimensional datasources, various multiway analysis methods employed, and the benefits of theseapproaches. A small example of Blind Source Separation (BSS) is presentedcomparing 2-dimensional algorithms and a multiway algorithm in Python. Resultsindicate that multiway analysis is more expressive. Contrary to the intuitionof the dimensionality curse, utilising multidimensional datasets in theirnative form and applying multiway analysis methods grounded in multilinearalgebra reveal a profound capacity to capture intricate interrelationshipsamong various dimensions while, surprisingly, reducing the number of modelparameters and accelerating processing.

From a word separated by blank space, which is termed an eojeol, toa sequence of morphemes in Korean, there are multiple possible levels of wordsegmentation granularity in Korean. For specific language processing and corpusannotation tasks, several different granularity levels have been proposed andutilized, because the agglutinative languages including Korean language have aone-to-one mapping between functional morpheme and syntactic category. Thus, weanalyze these different granularity levels, presenting the examples of Koreanlanguage processing systems for future reference. Interestingly, thegranularity by separating only functional morphemes including case markers andverbal endings, and keeping other suffixes for morphological derivation resultsin the optimal performance for phrase structure parsing. This contradictsprevious best practices for Korean language processing, which has been the defacto standard for various applications that require separating all morphemes.</description><author>Jungyeul Park, Mija Kim</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 14:42:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03713v1</guid></item><item><title>Generative-based Fusion Mechanism for Multi-Modal Tracking</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01728v2</link><description>Generative models (GMs) have received increasing research interest for theirremarkable capacity to achieve comprehensive understanding. However, theirpotential application in the domain of multi-modal tracking has remainedrelatively unexplored. In this context, we seek to uncover the potential ofharnessing generative techniques to address the critical challenge, informationfusion, in multi-modal tracking. In this paper, we delve into two prominent GMtechniques, namely, Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) andDiffusion Models (DMs). Different from the standard fusion process where thefeatures from each modality are directly fed into the fusion block, wecondition these multi-modal features with random noise in the GM framework,effectively transforming the original training samples into harder instances.This design excels at extracting discriminative clues from the features,enhancing the ultimate tracking performance. To quantitatively gauge theeffectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across twomulti-modal tracking tasks, three baseline methods, and three challengingbenchmarks.

For example, a smartwatch can record the acceleration and orientationof a person's motion, and these signals are recorded as multivariate timeseries. We can classify this data to understand and predict human movement andvarious properties such as fitness levels. In many applications classificationalone is not enough, we often need to classify but also understand what themodel learns (e.g., why was a prediction given, based on what information inthe data). The main focus of this paper is on analysing and evaluatingexplanation methods tailored to Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC).We focus on saliency-based explanation methods that can point out the mostrelevant channels and time series points for the classification decision. Weanalyse two popular and accurate multivariate time series classifiers, ROCKETand dResNet, as well as two popular explanation methods, SHAP and dCAM. Westudy these methods on 3 synthetic datasets and 2 real-world datasets andprovide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the explanations provided.We find that flattening the multivariate datasets by concatenating the channelsworks as well as using multivariate classifiers directly and adaptations ofSHAP for MTSC work quite well.

In such situations, the successor representation(SR) is a popular framework which supports rapid policy evaluation bydecoupling a policy's expected discounted, cumulative state occupancies from aspecific reward function. However, in the natural world, sequential tasks arerarely independent, and instead reflect shifting priorities based on theavailability and subjective perception of rewarding stimuli. Reflecting thisdisjunction, in this paper we study the phenomenon of diminishing marginalutility and introduce a novel state representation, the $\lambda$representation ($\lambda$R) which, surprisingly, is required for policyevaluation in this setting and which generalizes the SR as well as severalother state representations from the literature. We establish the $\lambda$R'sformal properties and examine its normative advantages in the context ofmachine learning, as well as its usefulness for studying natural behaviors,particularly foraging.</description><author>Ted Moskovitz, Samo Hromadka, Ahmed Touati, Diana Borsa, Maneesh Sahani</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 14:38:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03710v1</guid></item><item><title>Chat Failures and Troubles: Reasons and Solutions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03708v1</link><description>This paper examines some common problems in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)causing failures and troubles in Chat.

In this paper, we introduce a simple, yetvery effective graph convolutional network with skip connections forsemi-supervised anomaly detection. The proposed layerwise propagation rule ofour model is theoretically motivated by the concept of implicit fairing ingeometry processing, and comprises a graph convolution module for aggregatinginformation from immediate node neighbors and a skip connection module forcombining layer-wise neighborhood representations. This propagation rule isderived from the iterative solution of the implicit fairing equation via theJacobi method. In addition to capturing information from distant graph nodesthrough skip connections between the network's layers, our approach exploitsboth the graph structure and node features for learning discriminative noderepresentations. These skip connections are integrated by design in ourproposed network architecture. The effectiveness of our model is demonstratedthrough extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, achieving better orcomparable anomaly detection results against strong baseline methods.

Transfer learning has the potential to bridge the gapbetween related yet different domains. For medical applications, however, itremains unclear whether it is more beneficial to pre-train on natural ormedical images. We aim to shed light on this problem by comparinginitialization on ImageNet and RadImageNet on seven medical classificationtasks. Our work includes a replication study, which yields results contrary topreviously published findings. In our experiments, ResNet50 models pre-trainedon ImageNet tend to outperform those trained on RadImageNet. To gain furtherinsights, we investigate the learned representations using CanonicalCorrelation Analysis (CCA) and compare the predictions of the different models.Our results indicate that, contrary to intuition, ImageNet and RadImageNet mayconverge to distinct intermediate representations, which appear to divergefurther during fine-tuning. Despite these distinct representations, thepredictions of the models remain similar. Our findings show that the similaritybetween networks before and after fine-tuning does not correlate withperformance gains, suggesting that the advantages of transfer learning mightnot solely originate from the reuse of features in the early layers of aconvolutional neural network.</description><author>Dovile Juodelyte, Amelia Jiménez-Sánchez, Veronika Cheplygina</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 14:21:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08272v2</guid></item><item><title>Efficient Adaptive Human-Object Interaction Detection with Concept-guided Memory</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03696v1</link><description>Human Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize and infer therelationships between a human and an object.

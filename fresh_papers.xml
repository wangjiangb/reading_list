However, the fieldremains underexplored regarding non-verbal communication despite evidencedemonstrating its importance in human interaction. In particular, generatinglaughter sequences presents a unique challenge due to the intricacy and nuancesof this behaviour. This paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing a novelmodel capable of generating realistic laughter sequences, given a stillportrait and an audio clip containing laughter. We highlight the failure casesof traditional facial animation methods and leverage recent advances indiffusion models to produce convincing laughter videos. We train our model on adiverse set of laughter datasets and introduce an evaluation metricspecifically designed for laughter. When compared with previous speech-drivenapproaches, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics,even when these are re-trained for laughter generation.</description><author>Antoni Bigata Casademunt, Rodrigo Mira, Nikita Drobyshev, Konstantinos Vougioukas, Stavros Petridis, Maja Pantic</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 18:59:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08854v1</guid></item><item><title>CQE: A Comprehensive Quantity Extractor</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08853v1</link><description>Quantities are essential in documents to describe factual information. Theyare ubiquitous in application domains such as finance, business, medicine, andscience in general. Compared to other information extraction approaches,interestingly only a few works exist that describe methods for a properextraction and representation of quantities in text. In this paper, we presentsuch a comprehensive quantity extraction framework from text data. Itefficiently detects combinations of values and units, the behavior of aquantity (e.g., rising or falling), and the concept a quantity is associatedwith. Our framework makes use of dependency parsing and a dictionary of units,and it provides for a proper normalization and standardization of detectedquantities. Using a novel dataset for evaluation, we show that our open sourceframework outperforms other systems and -- to the best of our knowledge -- isthe first to detect concepts associated with identified quantities.

On top of the performance, other criteria such as inference time ormemory requirement often need to be optimized due to some practical reasons.This motivates research on multi-objective optimization (MOO). However, Paretofronts of MOO methods are often shown without considering the variabilitycaused by random seeds and this makes the performance stability evaluationdifficult. Although there is a concept named empirical attainment surface toenable the visualization with uncertainty over multiple runs, there is no majorPython package for empirical attainment surface. We, therefore, develop aPython package for this purpose and describe the usage.

This is because BEV perception is typically set upin an 'onboard' manner, which restricts the computation and consequentlyprevents algorithms from reasoning multiple views simultaneously. This paperovercomes these limitations and advocates a more practical 'offboard' HD-Mapgeneration setup that removes the computation constraints, based on the factthat HD-Maps are commonly reusable infrastructures built offline in datacenters. To this end, we propose a novel offboard pipeline called MV-Map thatcapitalizes multi-view consistency and can handle an arbitrary number of frameswith the key design of a 'region-centric' framework. In MV-Map, the targetHD-Maps are created by aggregating all the frames of onboard predictions,weighted by the confidence scores assigned by an 'uncertainty network'. Tofurther enhance multi-view consistency, we augment the uncertainty network withthe global 3D structure optimized by a voxelized neural radiance field(Voxel-NeRF). Extensive experiments on nuScenes show that our MV-Mapsignificantly improves the quality of HD-Maps, further highlighting theimportance of offboard methods for HD-Map generation.</description><author>Ziyang Xie, Ziqi Pang, Yuxiong Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 18:59:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08851v1</guid></item><item><title>Make-A-Protagonist: Generic Video Editing with An Ensemble of Experts</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08850v1</link><description>The text-driven image and video diffusion models have achieved unprecedentedsuccess in generating realistic and diverse content. Recently, the editing andvariation of existing images and videos in diffusion-based generative modelshave garnered significant attention. However, previous works are limited toediting content with text or providing coarse personalization using a singlevisual clue, rendering them unsuitable for indescribable content that requiresfine-grained and detailed control. In this regard, we propose a generic videoediting framework called Make-A-Protagonist, which utilizes textual and visualclues to edit videos with the goal of empowering individuals to become theprotagonists. Specifically, we leverage multiple experts to parse source video,target visual and textual clues, and propose a visual-textual-based videogeneration model that employs mask-guided denoising sampling to generate thedesired output.

Common datadriven and learning-based methods such as neuralordinary differential equations (ODEs), however, typically fail to satisfythese manifold constraints and perform poorly for these applications. Toaddress this shortcoming, in this paper we study a class of neural ordinarydifferential equations that, by design, leave a given manifold invariant, andcharacterize their properties by leveraging the controllability properties ofcontrol affine systems. In particular, using a result due to Agrachev andCaponigro on approximating diffeomorphisms with flows of feedback controlsystems, we show that any map that can be represented as the flow of amanifold-constrained dynamical system can also be approximated using the flowof manifold-constrained neural ODE, whenever a certain controllabilitycondition is satisfied. Additionally, we show that this universal approximationproperty holds when the neural ODE has limited width in each layer, thusleveraging the depth of network instead for approximation. We verify ourtheoretical findings using numerical experiments on PyTorch for the manifoldsS2 and the 3-dimensional orthogonal group SO(3), which are model manifolds formechanical systems such as spacecrafts and satellites. We also compare theperformance of the manifold invariant neural ODE with classical neural ODEsthat ignore the manifold invariant properties and show the superiority of ourapproach in terms of accuracy and sample complexity.</description><author>Karthik Elamvazhuthi, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak, Fabio Pasqualetti</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 18:59:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08849v1</guid></item><item><title>Small Models are Valuable Plug-ins for Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08848v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 are powerful but theirweights are often publicly unavailable and their immense sizes make the modelsdifficult to be tuned with common hardware. As a result, effectively tuningthese models with large-scale supervised data can be challenging. As analternative, In-Context Learning (ICL) can only use a small number ofsupervised examples due to context length limits. In this paper, we proposeSuper In-Context Learning (SuperICL) which allows black-box LLMs to work withlocally fine-tuned smaller models, resulting in superior performance onsupervised tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that SuperICL can improveperformance beyond state-of-the-art fine-tuned models while addressing theinstability problem of in-context learning. Furthermore, SuperICL can enhancethe capabilities of smaller models, such as multilinguality andinterpretability.</description><author>Canwen Xu, Yichong Xu, Shuohang Wang, Yang Liu, Chenguang Zhu, Julian McAuley</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 18:59:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08848v1</guid></item><item><title>Privacy Auditing with One (1) Training Run</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08846v1</link><description>We propose a scheme for auditing differentially private machine learningsystems with a single training run.

Along this line of research, this work aims toinvestigate the capacity of LLMs that act as the ranking model for recommendersystems. To conduct our empirical study, we first formalize the recommendationproblem as a conditional ranking task, considering sequential interactionhistories as conditions and the items retrieved by the candidate generationmodel as candidates. We adopt a specific prompting approach to solving theranking task by LLMs: we carefully design the prompting template by includingthe sequential interaction history, the candidate items, and the rankinginstruction. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets forrecommender systems and derive several key findings for the use of LLMs inrecommender systems. We show that LLMs have promising zero-shot rankingabilities, even competitive to or better than conventional recommendationmodels on candidates retrieved by multiple candidate generators. We alsodemonstrate that LLMs struggle to perceive the order of historical interactionsand can be affected by biases like position bias, while these issues can bealleviated via specially designed prompting and bootstrapping strategies.

Similar to how humans learn and improve using feedback, previous workproposed providing language models with natural language feedback to guide themin repairing their outputs. Because human-generated critiques are expensive toobtain, researchers have devised learned critique generators in lieu of humancritics while assuming one can train downstream models to utilize generatedfeedback. However, this approach does not apply to black-box or limited accessmodels such as ChatGPT, as they cannot be fine-tuned. Moreover, in the era oflarge general-purpose language agents, fine-tuning is neither computationallynor spatially efficient as it results in multiple copies of the network. Inthis work, we introduce RL4F (Reinforcement Learning for Feedback), amulti-agent collaborative framework where the critique generator is trained tomaximize end-task performance of GPT-3, a fixed model more than 200 times itssize. RL4F produces critiques that help GPT-3 revise its outputs. We studythree datasets for action planning, summarization and alphabetization and showimprovements (~5% on average) in multiple text similarity metrics over strongbaselines across all three tasks.</description><author>Afra Feyza AkyÃ¼rek, Ekin AkyÃ¼rek, Aman Madaan, Ashwin Kalyan, Peter Clark, Derry Wijaya, Niket Tandon</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 18:57:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08844v1</guid></item><item><title>Straightening Out the Straight-Through Estimator: Overcoming Optimization Challenges in Vector Quantized Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08842v1</link><description>This work examines the challenges of training neural networks using vectorquantization using straight-through estimation. We find that a primary cause oftraining instability is the discrepancy between the model embedding and thecode-vector distribution. We identify the factors that contribute to thisissue, including the codebook gradient sparsity and the asymmetric nature ofthe commitment loss, which leads to misaligned code-vector assignments. Wepropose to address this issue via affine re-parameterization of the codevectors. Additionally, we introduce an alternating optimization to reduce thegradient error introduced by the straight-through estimation. Moreover, wepropose an improvement to the commitment loss to ensure better alignmentbetween the codebook representation and the model embedding. These optimizationmethods improve the mathematical approximation of the straight-throughestimation and, ultimately, the model performance. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of our methods on several common model architectures, such asAlexNet, ResNet, and ViT, across various tasks, including image classificationand generative modeling.</description><author>Minyoung Huh, Brian Cheung, Pulkit Agrawal, Phillip Isola</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 18:56:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08842v1</guid></item><item><title>A Theoretical Analysis of Optimistic Proximal Policy Optimization in Linear Markov Decision Processes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08841v1</link><description>The proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm stands as one of the mostprosperous methods in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). Despite itssuccess, the theoretical understanding of PPO remains deficient. Specifically,it is unclear whether PPO or its optimistic variants can effectively solvelinear Markov decision processes (MDPs), which are arguably the simplest modelsin RL with function approximation. To bridge this gap, we propose an optimisticvariant of PPO for episodic adversarial linear MDPs with full-informationfeedback, and establish a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/4}H^2K^{3/4})$ regret forit. Here $d$ is the ambient dimension of linear MDPs, $H$ is the length of eachepisode, and $K$ is the number of episodes. Compared with existing policy-basedalgorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art regret bound in both stochasticlinear MDPs and adversarial linear MDPs with full information. Additionally,our algorithm design features a novel multi-batched updating mechanism and thetheoretical analysis utilizes a new covering number argument of value andpolicy classes, which might be of independent interest.</description><author>Han Zhong, Tong Zhang</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 18:55:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08841v1</guid></item><item><title>Attacking Perceptual Similarity Metrics</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08840v1</link><description>Perceptual similarity metrics have progressively become more correlated withhuman judgments on perceptual similarity; however, despite recent advances, theaddition of an imperceptible distortion can still compromise these metrics. Inour study, we systematically examine the robustness of these metrics toimperceptible adversarial perturbations. Following the two-alternativeforced-choice experimental design with two distorted images and one referenceimage, we perturb the distorted image closer to the reference via anadversarial attack until the metric flips its judgment. We first show that allmetrics in our study are susceptible to perturbations generated via commonadversarial attacks such as FGSM, PGD, and the One-pixel attack. Next, weattack the widely adopted LPIPS metric using spatial-transformation-basedadversarial perturbations (stAdv) in a white-box setting to craft adversarialexamples that can effectively transfer to other similarity metrics in ablack-box setting. We also combine the spatial attack stAdv with PGD($\ell_\infty$-bounded) attack to increase transferability and use theseadversarial examples to benchmark the robustness of both traditional andrecently developed metrics. Our benchmark provides a good starting point fordiscussion and further research on the robustness of metrics to imperceptibleadversarial perturbations.</description><author>Abhijay Ghildyal, Feng Liu</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 18:55:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08840v1</guid></item><item><title>Adaptive Bias Correction for Improved Subseasonal Forecasting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10666v3</link><description>Subseasonal forecasting -- predicting temperature and precipitation 2 to 6weeks ahead -- is critical for effective water allocation, wildfire management,and drought and flood mitigation. Recent international research efforts haveadvanced the subseasonal capabilities of operational dynamical models, yettemperature and precipitation prediction skills remain poor, partly due tostubborn errors in representing atmospheric dynamics and physics insidedynamical models. Here, to counter these errors, we introduce an adaptive biascorrection (ABC) method that combines state-of-the-art dynamical forecasts withobservations using machine learning. We show that, when applied to the leadingsubseasonal model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts(ECMWF), ABC improves temperature forecasting skill by 60-90% (over baselineskills of 0.18-0.25) and precipitation forecasting skill by 40-69% (overbaseline skills of 0.11-0.15) in the contiguous U.S. We couple theseperformance improvements with a practical workflow to explain ABC skill gainsand identify higher-skill windows of opportunity based on specific climateconditions.</description><author>Soukayna Mouatadid, Paulo Orenstein, Genevieve Flaspohler, Judah Cohen, Miruna Oprescu, Ernest Fraenkel, Lester Mackey</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 18:50:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10666v3</guid></item><item><title>CryCeleb: A Speaker Verification Dataset Based on Infant Cry Sounds</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00969v3</link><description>This paper describes the Ubenwa CryCeleb dataset - a labeled collection ofinfant cries, and the accompanying CryCeleb 2023 task - a public speakerverification challenge based on infant cry sounds.

However, little to no work has proposedmethods to defend against these attacks. To do so, we rely on the intuitionthat redundant information often exists in large corpora. To find it, weintroduce a method that uses query augmentation to search for a diverse set ofpassages that could answer the original question but are less likely to havebeen poisoned. We integrate these new passages into the model through thedesign of a novel confidence method, comparing the predicted answer to itsappearance in the retrieved contexts (what we call \textit{Confidence fromAnswer Redundancy}, i.e. CAR). Together these methods allow for a simple buteffective way to defend against poisoning attacks that provides gains of nearly20\% exact match across varying levels of data poisoning/knowledge conflicts.</description><author>Orion Weller, Aleem Khan, Nathaniel Weir, Dawn Lawrie, Benjamin Van Durme</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 18:46:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10002v2</guid></item><item><title>PMIndiaSum: Multilingual and Cross-lingual Headline Summarization for Languages in India</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08828v1</link><description>This paper introduces PMIndiaSum, a new multilingual and massively parallelheadline summarization corpus focused on languages in India.

This issuebecomes more challenging in medical images since the abnormalities related todiseases can be tiny, and are easy to be corrupted (e.g., being cropped out) inthe current scheme of random augmentation. In this work, we first demonstratethat, for widely-used X-ray images, the conventional augmentation prevalent incontrastive pre-training can affect the performance of the downstream diagnosisor classification tasks. Then, we propose a novel augmentation method, i.e.,FocusContrast, to learn from radiologists' gaze in diagnosis and generatecontrastive views for medical images with guidance from radiologists' visualattention. Specifically, we track the gaze movement of radiologists and modeltheir visual attention when reading to diagnose X-ray images. The learned modelcan predict visual attention of the radiologists given a new input image, andfurther guide the attention-aware augmentation that hardly neglects thedisease-related abnormalities. As a plug-and-play and framework-agnosticmodule, FocusContrast consistently improves state-of-the-art contrastivelearning methods of SimCLR, MoCo, and BYOL by 4.0~7.0% in classificationaccuracy on a knee X-ray dataset.</description><author>Sheng Wang, Zixu Zhuang, Xi Ouyang, Lichi Zhang, Zheren Li, Chong Ma, Tianming Liu, Dinggang Shen, Qian Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 18:34:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08826v1</guid></item><item><title>Five A$^{+}$ Network: You Only Need 9K Parameters for Underwater Image Enhancement</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08824v1</link><description>A lightweight underwater image enhancement network is of great significancefor resource-constrained platforms, but balancing model size, computationalefficiency, and enhancement performance has proven difficult for previousapproaches.

Newbreakthroughs in architecture and data gathering continue to push theperformance of such conversational AI models. However, designs neglect thegradual buildup in sentence structure and complexity experienced by humans aswe learn to communicate. During training, our model accepts one or moresentences as input and attempts to predict the next sentence in theconversation one word at a time, so our goal is to separate training intosegments, with each segment's corpus comprised of longer sentence pairs thanthe previous one. This will mimic the desired "buildup" component of humanlearning. We begin with only "short" length sentence pairs, then only "medium"length pairs, and so on. A majority of our experiments were toward optimizingthis technique, ensuring a proper representation of the technique's potential,since many of the details were new questions.

In this work, we present another interesting and importantfeature of ReLU activation function. We show that ReLU leads to: {\it betterseparation} for similar data, and {\it better conditioning} of neural tangentkernel (NTK), which are closely related. Comparing with linear neural networks,we show that a ReLU activated wide neural network at random initialization hasa larger angle separation for similar data in the feature space of modelgradient, and has a smaller condition number for NTK. Note that, for a linearneural network, the data separation and NTK condition number always remain thesame as in the case of a linear model. Furthermore, we show that a deeper ReLUnetwork (i.e., with more ReLU activation operations), has a smaller NTKcondition number than a shallower one.

In this paper, we propose a novelframework named AutoRecon for the automated discovery and reconstruction of anobject from multi-view images. We demonstrate that foreground objects can berobustly located and segmented from SfM point clouds by leveragingself-supervised 2D vision transformer features. Then, we reconstruct decomposedneural scene representations with dense supervision provided by the decomposedpoint clouds, resulting in accurate object reconstruction and segmentation.Experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS and CO3D-V2 datasets demonstrate theeffectiveness and robustness of AutoRecon.</description><author>Yuang Wang, Xingyi He, Sida Peng, Haotong Lin, Hujun Bao, Xiaowei Zhou</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 18:16:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08810v1</guid></item><item><title>Interpretability at Scale: Identifying Causal Mechanisms in Alpaca</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08809v1</link><description>Obtaining human-interpretable explanations of large, general-purpose languagemodels is an urgent goal for AI safety. However, it is just as important thatour interpretability methods are faithful to the causal dynamics underlyingmodel behavior and able to robustly generalize to unseen inputs. DistributedAlignment Search (DAS) is a powerful gradient descent method grounded in atheory of causal abstraction that uncovered perfect alignments betweeninterpretable symbolic algorithms and small deep learning models fine-tuned forspecific tasks. In the present paper, we scale DAS significantly by replacingthe remaining brute-force search steps with learned parameters -- an approachwe call DAS. This enables us to efficiently search for interpretable causalstructure in large language models while they follow instructions. We apply DASto the Alpaca model (7B parameters), which, off the shelf, solves a simplenumerical reasoning problem. With DAS, we discover that Alpaca does this byimplementing a causal model with two interpretable boolean variables.Furthermore, we find that the alignment of neural representations with thesevariables is robust to changes in inputs and instructions. These findings marka first step toward deeply understanding the inner-workings of our largest andmost widely deployed language models.</description><author>Zhengxuan Wu, Atticus Geiger, Christopher Potts, Noah D.

To answer that, we introduce apoint cloud representation learning framework, based on geometric featurereconstruction. In contrast to recent papers that directly adopt maskedautoencoder (MAE) and only predict original coordinates or occupancy frommasked point clouds, our method revisits differences between images and pointclouds and identifies three self-supervised learning objectives peculiar topoint clouds, namely centroid prediction, normal estimation, and curvatureprediction. Combined with occupancy prediction, these four objectives yield annontrivial self-supervised learning task and mutually facilitate models tobetter reason fine-grained geometry of point clouds. Our pipeline isconceptually simple and it consists of two major steps: first, it randomlymasks out groups of points, followed by a Transformer-based point cloudencoder; second, a lightweight Transformer decoder predicts centroid, normal,and curvature for points in each voxel. We transfer the pre-trained Transformerencoder to a downstream peception model. On the nuScene Datset, our modelachieves 3.38 mAP improvment for object detection, 2.1 mIoU gain forsegmentation, and 1.7 AMOTA gain for multi-object tracking.

However, atthe moment, building a knowledge graph involves a lot of manual effort and thushinders their application in some situations and the automation of this processmight benefit especially for small organizations.

The recent advancement of foundationmodels with billions of parameters trained in a self-supervised manner withlarge volumes of training data that can be adapted to a variety of downstreamtasks has helped to demonstrate high performance on a large range of NaturalLanguage Processing (NLP) tasks. In this context, one emerging paradigm isin-context learning where a language model is used as it is with a prompt thatprovides instructions and some examples to perform a task without changing theparameters of the model using traditional approaches such as fine-tuning.

However, it is challenging to place sensors in a waythat maximises the informativeness of their measurements, particularly inremote regions like Antarctica. Probabilistic machine learning models cansuggest informative sensor placements by finding sites that maximally reduceprediction uncertainty. Gaussian process (GP) models are widely used for thispurpose, but they struggle with capturing complex non-stationary behaviour andscaling to large datasets. This paper proposes using a convolutional Gaussianneural process (ConvGNP) to address these issues. A ConvGNP uses neuralnetworks to parameterise a joint Gaussian distribution at arbitrary targetlocations, enabling flexibility and scalability. Using simulated surface airtemperature anomaly over Antarctica as training data, the ConvGNP learnsspatial and seasonal non-stationarities, outperforming a non-stationary GPbaseline. In a simulated sensor placement experiment, the ConvGNP betterpredicts the performance boost obtained from new observations than GPbaselines, leading to more informative sensor placements. We contrast ourapproach with physics-based sensor placement methods and propose future stepstowards an operational sensor placement recommendation system. Our work couldhelp to realise environmental digital twins that actively direct measurementsampling to improve the digital representation of reality.</description><author>Tom R. Andersson, Wessel P.

This high-paced stock price forecasting isusually based on vectors that need to be treated as sequential andtime-independent signals due to the time irregularities that are inherent inhigh-frequency trading. A well-documented and tested method that considersthese time-irregularities is a type of recurrent neural network, named longshort-term memory neural network. This type of neural network is formed basedon cells that perform sequential and stale calculations via gates and stateswithout knowing whether their order, within the cell, is optimal. In thispaper, we propose a revised and real-time adjusted long short-term memory cellthat selects the best gate or state as its final output. Our cell is runningunder a shallow topology, has a minimal look-back period, and is trainedonline.

However, holistic benchmarks-- such as algorithmic or randomized benchmarks -- typically do not predict aprocessor's performance on circuits outside the benchmark's necessarily verylimited set of test circuits. In this paper, we introduce a general frameworkfor building predictive models from benchmarking data using capability models.Capability models can be fit to many kinds of benchmarking data and used for avariety of predictive tasks. We demonstrate this flexibility with two casestudies. In the first case study, we predict circuit (i) process fidelities and(ii) success probabilities by fitting error rates models to two kinds ofvolumetric benchmarking data. Error rates models are simple, yet versatilecapability models which assign effective error rates to individual gates, ormore general circuit components. In the second case study, we construct acapability model for predicting circuit success probabilities by applyingtransfer learning to ResNet50, a neural network trained for imageclassification.

It helps achieve diverse and high-quality responses byselecting an answer from a small pool of generated candidates. The currentstate-of-the-art ranking methods mainly use an encoding paradigm calledCross-Encoder, which separately encodes each context-candidate pair and ranksthe candidates according to their fitness scores. However, Cross-Encoderrepeatedly encodes the same lengthy context for each candidate, resulting inhigh computational costs. Poly-Encoder addresses the above problems by reducingthe interaction between context and candidates, but with a price of performancedrop. In this work, we develop a new paradigm called Uni-Encoder, that keepsthe full attention over each pair as in Cross-Encoder while only encoding thecontext once, as in Poly-Encoder. Uni-Encoder encodes all the candidates withthe context in one forward pass. We use the same positional embedding for allcandidates to ensure they are treated equally and design a new attentionmechanism to avoid confusion. Our Uni-Encoder can simulate other rankingparadigms using different attention and response concatenation methods.Extensive experiments show that our proposed paradigm achieves newstate-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets with high computationalefficiency. For instance, it improves R10@1 by 2.9% with an approximately 4Xfaster inference speed on the Ubuntu V2 dataset.</description><author>Chiyu Song, Hongliang He, Haofei Yu, Pengfei Fang, Leyang Cui, Zhenzhong Lan</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 17:53:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01263v5</guid></item><item><title>Multi-Task Attentive Residual Networks for Argument Mining</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12227v2</link><description>We explore the use of residual networks and neural attention for multipleargument mining tasks.

Influence maximiza-tion (IM) algorithms aim to identify individuals who will generate the greatestspread through the social network if provided with information, and have beenlargely devel- oped with marketing in mind. In social networks with communitystructure, which are very common, IM algorithms focused solely on maximizingspread may yield signifi- cant disparities in information coverage betweencommunities, which is problematic in settings such as public health messaging.While some IM algorithms aim to remedy disparity in information coverage usingnode attributes, none use the empirical com- munity structure within thenetwork itself, which may be beneficial since communities directly affect thespread of information. Further, the use of empirical network struc- ture allowsus to leverage community detection techniques, making it possible to runfair-aware algorithms when there are no relevant node attributes available, orwhen node attributes do not accurately capture network community structure. Incontrast to other fair IM algorithms, this work relies on fitting a model tothe social network which is then used to determine a seed allocation strategyfor optimal fair information spread. We develop an algorithm to determineoptimal seed allocations for expected fair coverage, defined through maximumentropy, provide some theoretical guarantees under appropriate conditions, anddemonstrate its empirical accuracy on both simu- lated and real networks.Because this algorithm relies on a fitted network model and not on the networkdirectly, it is well-suited for partially observed and noisy social networks.</description><author>Octavio Mesner, Elizaveta Levina, Ji Zhu</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 17:51:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08791v1</guid></item><item><title>Comparing Variation in Tokenizer Outputs Using a Series of Problematic and Challenging Biomedical Sentences</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08787v1</link><description>Background &amp; Objective: Biomedical text data are increasingly available forresearch. Tokenization is an initial step in many biomedical text miningpipelines. Tokenization is the process of parsing an input biomedical sentence(represented as a digital character sequence) into a discrete set of word/tokensymbols, which convey focused semantic/syntactic meaning. The objective of thisstudy is to explore variation in tokenizer outputs when applied across a seriesof challenging biomedical sentences. Method: Diaz [2015] introduce 24 challenging example biomedical sentences forcomparing tokenizer performance. In this study, we descriptively explorevariation in outputs of eight tokenizers applied to each example biomedicalsentence. The tokenizers compared in this study are the NLTK white spacetokenizer, the NLTK Penn Tree Bank tokenizer, Spacy and SciSpacy tokenizers,Stanza/Stanza-Craft tokenizers, the UDPipe tokenizer, and R-tokenizers. Results: For many examples, tokenizers performed similarly effectively;however, for certain examples, there were meaningful variation in returnedoutputs. The white space tokenizer often performed differently than othertokenizers. We observed performance similarities for tokenizers implementingrule-based systems (e.g. pattern matching and regular expressions) andtokenizers implementing neural architectures for token classification.Oftentimes, the challenging tokens resulting in the greatest variation inoutputs, are those words which convey substantive and focusedbiomedical/clinical meaning (e.g. x-ray, IL-10, TCR/CD3, CD4+ CD8+, and(Ca2+)-regulated). Conclusion: When state-of-the-art, open-source tokenizers from Python and Rwere applied to a series of challenging biomedical example sentences, weobserved subtle variation in the returned outputs.</description><author>Christopher Meaney, Therese A Stukel, Peter C Austin, Michael Escobar</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 17:46:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08787v1</guid></item><item><title>On Noisy Evaluation in Federated Hyperparameter Tuning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08930v4</link><description>Hyperparameter tuning is critical to the success of federated learningapplications.

Identifying IDU early and initiating harm reductioninterventions can benefit individuals at risk. However, extracting IDUbehaviors from patients' electronic health records (EHR) is difficult becausethere is no International Classification of Disease (ICD) code and the onlyplace IDU information can be indicated are unstructured free-text clinicalprogress notes. Although natural language processing (NLP) can efficientlyextract this information from unstructured data, there are no validated tools.To address this gap in clinical information, we design and demonstrate aquestion-answering (QA) framework to extract information on IDU from clinicalprogress notes. Unlike other methods discussed in the literature, the QA modelis able to extract various types of information without being constrained bypredefined entities, relations, or concepts. Our framework involves two mainsteps: (1) generating a gold-standard QA dataset and (2) developing and testingthe QA model. This paper also demonstrates the QA model's ability to extractIDU-related information on temporally out-of-distribution data.

In this paper, we propose aninnovative methodology Bridge3D to address this gap, pre-training 3D modelsusing features, semantic masks, and captions sourced from foundation models.Specifically, our approach utilizes semantic masks from these models to guidethe masking and reconstruction process in the masked autoencoder. This strategyenables the network to concentrate more on foreground objects, therebyenhancing 3D representation learning. Additionally, we bridge the 3D-text gapat the scene level by harnessing image captioning foundation models. To furtherfacilitate knowledge distillation from well-learned 2D and text representationsto the 3D model, we introduce a novel method that employs foundation models togenerate highly accurate object-level masks and semantic text information atthe object level. Our approach notably outshines state-of-the-art methods in 3Dobject detection and semantic segmentation tasks. For instance, on the ScanNetdataset, our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method, PiMAE, by asignificant margin of 5.3%.</description><author>Zhimin Chen, Bing Li</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 17:36:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08776v1</guid></item><item><title>Integrating Diverse Knowledge Sources for Online One-shot Learning of Novel Tasks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09554v3</link><description>Autonomous agents are able to draw on a wide variety of potential sources oftask knowledge; however current approaches invariably focus on only one or two.Here we investigate the challenges and impact of exploiting diverse knowledgesources to learn online, in one-shot, new tasks for a simulated office mobilerobot.

To meet their extremedata-rate and latency requirements, future VR systems will require supportingwireless networking infrastructures operating in millimeter Wave (mmWave)frequencies that leverage highly directional communication in both transmissionand reception through beamforming and beamsteering. We propose the use ofpredictive context-awareness to optimize transmitter and receiver-sidebeamforming and beamsteering. By predicting users' short-term lateral movementsin multiuser VR setups with Redirected Walking (RDW), transmitter-sidebeamforming and beamsteering can be optimized through Line-of-Sight (LoS)"tracking" in the users' directions. At the same time, predictions ofshort-term orientational movements can be utilized for receiver-sidebeamforming for coverage flexibility enhancements. We target two open problemsin predicting these two context information instances: i) predicting lateralmovements in multiuser VR settings with RDW, and ii) generating synthetic headrotation datasets for training orientational movements predictors. Ourexperimental results demonstrate that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networksfeature promising accuracy in predicting lateral movements, andcontext-awareness stemming from VEs further enhances this accuracy.Additionally, we show that a TimeGAN-based approach for orientational datageneration can create synthetic samples that closely match experimentallyobtained ones.</description><author>Filip Lemic, Jakob Struye, Thomas Van Onsem, Jeroen Famaey, Xavier Costa Perez</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 17:34:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17907v3</guid></item><item><title>SVD-DIP: Overcoming the Overfitting Problem in DIP-based CT Reconstruction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15748v3</link><description>The deep image prior (DIP) is a well-established unsupervised deep learningmethod for image reconstruction; yet it is far from being flawless. The DIPoverfits to noise if not early stopped, or optimized via a regularizedobjective. We build on the regularized fine-tuning of a pretrained DIP, byadopting a novel strategy that restricts the learning to the adaptation ofsingular values. The proposed SVD-DIP uses ad hoc convolutional layers whosepretrained parameters are decomposed via the singular value decomposition.Optimizing the DIP then solely consists in the fine-tuning of the singularvalues, while keeping the left and right singular vectors fixed. We thoroughlyvalidate the proposed method on real-measured $\mu$CT data of a lotus root aswell as two medical datasets (LoDoPaB and Mayo).

UnlikeDBMS, however, Python applications may lose important data, such as trainedmodels and extracted features, due to machine failures or human errors, leadingto a waste of time and resources. Specifically, they lack four essentialproperties that could make ML more reliable and user-friendly -- durability,atomicity, replicability, and time-versioning (DART). This paper presents our vision of Transactional Python that provides DARTwithout any code modifications to user programs or the Python kernel, bynon-intrusively monitoring application states at the object level anddetermining a minimal amount of information sufficient to reconstruct a wholeapplication.

As a result, these systems allow power utilitycompanies to respond promptly to demands in the electricity market. Deeplearning (DL) models have been commonly employed in load forecasting problemssupported by adaptation mechanisms to cope with the changing pattern ofconsumption by customers, known as concept drift. A drift magnitude thresholdshould be defined to design change detection methods to identify drifts. Whilethe drift magnitude in load forecasting problems can vary significantly overtime, existing literature often assumes a fixed drift magnitude threshold,which should be dynamically adjusted rather than fixed during system evolution.To address this gap, in this paper, we propose a dynamic drift-adaptive LongShort-Term Memory (DA-LSTM) framework that can improve the performance of loadforecasting models without requiring a drift threshold setting. We integrateseveral strategies into the framework based on active and passive adaptationapproaches. To evaluate DA-LSTM in real-life settings, we thoroughly analyzethe proposed framework and deploy it in a real-world problem through acloud-based environment. Efficiency is evaluated in terms of the predictionperformance of each approach and computational cost. The experiments showperformance improvements on multiple evaluation metrics achieved by ourframework compared to baseline methods from the literature. Finally, we presenta trade-off analysis between prediction performance and computational costs.</description><author>Firas Bayram, Phil Aupke, Bestoun S.

HKG consists of hyper-relational facts (H-Facts), composed of a maintriple and several auxiliary attribute-value qualifiers, which can effectivelyrepresent factually comprehensive information. The internal structure of HKGcan be represented as a hypergraph-based representation globally and a semanticsequence-based representation locally. However, existing research seldomsimultaneously models the graphical and sequential structure of HKGs, limitingHKGs' representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novelHierarchical Attention model for HKG Embedding (HAHE), including global-leveland local-level attention. The global-level attention can model the graphicalstructure of HKG using hypergraph dual-attention layers, while the local-levelattention can learn the sequential structure inside H-Facts via heterogeneousself-attention layers. Experiment results indicate that HAHE achievesstate-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks on HKG standard datasets.In addition, HAHE addresses the issue of HKG multi-position prediction for thefirst time, increasing the applicability of the HKG link prediction task.

While classical approaches are often prohibitivelyslow, machine learning models often fail to incorporate complete systeminformation. Over the past few years, transformers have had a significantimpact on the field of Artificial Intelligence and have seen increased usage inPDE applications. However, despite their success, transformers currently lackintegration with physics and reasoning. This study aims to address this issueby introducing PITT: Physics Informed Token Transformer. The purpose of PITT isto incorporate the knowledge of physics by embedding partial differentialequations (PDEs) into the learning process. PITT uses an equation tokenizationmethod to learn an analytically-driven numerical update operator. By tokenizingPDEs and embedding partial derivatives, the transformer models become aware ofthe underlying knowledge behind physical processes. To demonstrate this, PITTis tested on challenging PDE neural operators in both 1D and 2D predictiontasks. The results show that PITT outperforms the popular Fourier NeuralOperator and has the ability to extract physically relevant information fromgoverning equations.</description><author>Cooper Lorsung, Zijie Li, Amir Barati Farimani</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 17:11:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08757v1</guid></item><item><title>Tetra-NeRF: Representing Neural Radiance Fields Using Tetrahedra</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09987v2</link><description>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are a very recent and very popular approachfor the problems of novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. A popular scenerepresentation used by NeRFs is to combine a uniform, voxel-based subdivisionof the scene with an MLP. Based on the observation that a (sparse) point cloudof the scene is often available, this paper proposes to use an adaptiverepresentation based on tetrahedra obtained by the Delaunay triangulationinstead of the uniform subdivision or point-based representations. We show thatsuch a representation enables efficient training and leads to state-of-the-artresults. Our approach elegantly combines concepts from 3D geometry processing,triangle-based rendering, and modern neural radiance fields. Compared tovoxel-based representations, ours provides more detail around parts of thescene likely to be close to the surface.

Our study illustrates that different labeling methodologiesdirectly impact the annotations' quality, as well as the capabilities of a deeplearning classifier trained with the data respectively. We noticed that in situmethods produce less but more precise labels than recall methods. Furthermore,we combined an activity diary with a visualization tool that enables theparticipant to inspect and label their activity data.

However and despite promising research-stage results, major challengespreventing the use of such methods in real-life missions still stand in theway. In particular, the deployment of such computation-intensive algorithms isstill under-investigated, while the performance drop when training on syntheticand testing on real images remains to mitigate.

Prediction uncertainty is typically categorized intoaleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. The former refers to inherentrandomness in data, while the latter describes uncertainty in the modelparameters. In this work, we propose a framework to jointly model aleatoric andepistemic uncertainties in neural network-based speech enhancement. Theproposed approach captures aleatoric uncertainty by estimating the statisticalmoments of the speech posterior distribution and explicitly incorporates theuncertainty estimate to further improve clean speech estimation. For epistemicuncertainty, we investigate two Bayesian deep learning approaches: Monte Carlodropout and Deep ensembles to quantify the uncertainty of the neural networkparameters. Our analyses show that the proposed framework promotes capturingpractical and reliable uncertainty, while combining different sources ofuncertainties yields more reliable predictive uncertainty estimates.Furthermore, we demonstrate the benefits of modeling uncertainty on speechenhancement performance by evaluating the framework on different datasets,exhibiting notable improvement over comparable models that fail to account foruncertainty.</description><author>Huajian Fang, Dennis Becker, Stefan Wermter, Timo Gerkmann</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 16:55:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08744v1</guid></item><item><title>Lie Group Forced Variational Integrator Networks for Learning and Control of Robot Systems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16006v4</link><description>Incorporating prior knowledge of physics laws and structural properties ofdynamical systems into the design of deep learning architectures has proven tobe a powerful technique for improving their computational efficiency andgeneralization capacity.

Amortized variationalinference is restricted by the expressive power of the chosen variationaldistribution and the availability of training data in the form of joint dataand parameter samples, which often lead to approximation errors such as theamortization gap. To address this issue, we propose an iterative framework thatrefines the current amortized posterior approximation at each step. Ourapproach involves alternating between two steps: (1) constructing a trainingdataset consisting of pairs of summarized data residuals and parameters, wherethe summarized data residual is generated using a gradient-based summarystatistic, and (2) training a conditional generative model -- a normalizingflow in our examples -- on this dataset to obtain a probabilistic update of theunknown parameter. This procedure leads to iterative refinement of theamortized posterior approximations without the need for extra training data. Wevalidate our method in a controlled setting by applying it to a stylizedproblem, and observe improved posterior approximations with each iteration.Additionally, we showcase the capability of our method in tacklingrealistically sized problems by applying it to transcranial ultrasound, ahigh-dimensional, nonlinear inverse problem governed by wave physics, andobserve enhanced posterior quality through better image reconstruction with theposterior mean.</description><author>Rafael Orozco, Ali Siahkoohi, Mathias Louboutin, Felix J.

In thispaper, we propose a new paradigm dubbed Knowledge Rumination to help thepre-trained language model utilize those related latent knowledge withoutretrieving them from the external corpus. By simply adding a prompt like ``Asfar as I know'' to the PLMs, we try to review related latent knowledge andinject them back to the model for knowledge consolidation. We apply theproposed knowledge rumination to various language models, including RoBERTa,DeBERTa, GPT-3 and OPT. Experimental results on six commonsense reasoning tasksand GLUE benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach,which further proves that the knowledge stored in PLMs can be better exploitedto enhance the downstream performance.

Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs)are a promising approach for learning feature representations in such spaces.However, current HNNs in computer vision rely on Euclidean backbones and onlyproject features to the hyperbolic space in the task heads, limiting theirability to fully leverage the benefits of hyperbolic geometry. To address this,we present HCNN, the first fully hyperbolic convolutional neural network (CNN)designed for computer vision tasks. Based on the Lorentz model, we generalizefundamental components of CNNs and propose novel formulations of theconvolutional layer, batch normalization, and multinomial logistic regression.Experimentation on standard vision tasks demonstrates the superiority of ourHCNN framework and the Lorentz model in both hybrid and fully hyperbolicsettings.

A key issue with these models is their tendencyto output samples outside of the support of the target distribution whenlearning disconnected distributions. We investigate the relationship betweenthe performance of these models and the geometry of their latent space.Building on recent developments in geometric measure theory, we prove asufficient condition for optimality in the case where the dimension of thelatent space is larger than the number of modes. Through experiments on GANs,we demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results and gain new insightsinto the latent space geometry of these models. Additionally, we propose atruncation method that enforces a simplicial cluster structure in the latentspace and improves the performance of GANs.</description><author>Thibaut Issenhuth, Ugo Tanielian, JÃ©rÃ©mie Mary, David Picard</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 16:39:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10541v3</guid></item><item><title>Learning More Discriminative Local Descriptors for Few-shot Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08721v1</link><description>Few-shot learning for image classification comes up as a hot topic incomputer vision, which aims at fast learning from a limited number of labeledimages and generalize over the new tasks.

Most publicdatasets currently contain only PDF documents and lack realistic documents.Models trained on these datasets may not generalize well to real-worldscenarios. Therefore, this paper introduces a large and diverse document layoutanalysis dataset called $M^{6}Doc$. The $M^6$ designation represents sixproperties: (1) Multi-Format (including scanned, photographed, and PDFdocuments); (2) Multi-Type (such as scientific articles, textbooks, books, testpapers, magazines, newspapers, and notes); (3) Multi-Layout (rectangular,Manhattan, non-Manhattan, and multi-column Manhattan); (4) Multi-Language(Chinese and English); (5) Multi-Annotation Category (74 types of annotationlabels with 237,116 annotation instances in 9,080 manually annotated pages);and (6) Modern documents. Additionally, we propose a transformer-based documentlayout analysis method called TransDLANet, which leverages an adaptive elementmatching mechanism that enables query embedding to better match ground truth toimprove recall, and constructs a segmentation branch for more precise documentimage instance segmentation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of$M^{6}Doc$ with various layout analysis methods and demonstrate itseffectiveness. TransDLANet achieves state-of-the-art performance on $M^{6}Doc$with 64.5\% mAP.

However, a criticalissue has been identified within this domain: the lack of sensitivity androbustness of these models towards Prompt Templates, particularly inlesser-studied languages such as Japanese. This paper explores this issuethrough a comprehensive evaluation of several representative Large LanguageModels (LLMs) and a widely-utilized pre-trained model(PLM), T5. These modelsare scrutinized using a benchmark dataset in Japanese, with the aim to assessand analyze the performance of the current multilingual models in this context.Our experimental results reveal startling discrepancies. A simple modificationin the sentence structure of the Prompt Template led to a drastic drop in theaccuracy of GPT-4 from 49.21 to 25.44. This observation underscores the factthat even the highly performance GPT-4 model encounters significant stabilityissues when dealing with diverse Japanese prompt templates, rendering theconsistency of the model's output results questionable. In light of thesefindings, we conclude by proposing potential research trajectories to furtherenhance the development and performance of Large Language Models in theircurrent stage.</description><author>Chengguang Gan, Tatsunori Mori</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 16:19:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08714v1</guid></item><item><title>sustain.AI: a Recommender System to analyze Sustainability Reports</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08711v1</link><description>We present sustain.AI, an intelligent, context-aware recommender system thatassists auditors and financial investors as well as the general public toefficiently analyze companies' sustainability reports.

Unfortunately, transcripts are only sometimesavailable since numerous unwritten languages exist worldwide. In this paper, weaim to utilize large amounts of target-side monolingual data to enhance STwithout transcripts. Motivated by the remarkable success of back translation inMT, we develop a back translation algorithm for ST (BT4ST) to synthesize pseudoST data from monolingual target data. To ease the challenges posed byshort-to-long generation and one-to-many mapping, we introduce self-superviseddiscrete units and achieve back translation by cascading a target-to-unit modeland a unit-to-speech model.

Centralized methods in priorworks are only able to solve small or medium size problems due to overhead incomputation and communication. In this paper, we present a fully decentralizedmethod that alleviates computation and communication bottlenecks to solvearbitrarily large bundle adjustment problems. We achieve this by reformulatingthe reprojection error and deriving a novel surrogate function that decouplesoptimization variables from different devices. This function makes it possibleto use majorization minimization techniques and reduces bundle adjustment toindependent optimization subproblems that can be solved in parallel. We furtherapply Nesterov's acceleration and adaptive restart to improve convergence whilemaintaining its theoretical guarantees. Despite limited peer-to-peercommunication, our method has provable convergence to first-order criticalpoints under mild conditions. On extensive benchmarks with public datasets, ourmethod converges much faster than decentralized baselines with similar memoryusage and communication load. Compared to centralized baselines using a singledevice, our method, while being decentralized, yields more accurate solutionswith significant speedups of up to 953.7x over Ceres and 174.6x over DeepLM.Code: https://github.com/facebookresearch/DABA.</description><author>Taosha Fan, Joseph Ortiz, Ming Hsiao, Maurizio Monge, Jing Dong, Todd Murphey, Mustafa Mukadam</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 16:10:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07026v2</guid></item><item><title>On Low Rank Directed Acyclic Graphs and Causal Structure Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05691v2</link><description>Despite several advances in recent years, learning causal structuresrepresented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) remains a challenging task inhigh dimensional settings when the graphs to be learned are not sparse.

We utilizeexisting low rank techniques to adapt causal structure learning methods to takeadvantage of this assumption and establish several useful results relatinginterpretable graphical conditions to the low rank assumption.

Among various existing techniques, multi-tasklearning is one of the effective ways to share knowledge between ST and MT inwhich additional MT data can help to learn source-to-target mapping. However,due to the differences between speech and text, there is always a gap betweenST and MT. In this paper, we first aim to understand this modality gap from thetarget-side representation differences, and link the modality gap to anotherwell-known problem in neural machine translation: exposure bias. We find thatthe modality gap is relatively small during training except for some difficultcases, but keeps increasing during inference due to the cascading effect. Toaddress these problems, we propose the Cross-modal Regularization withScheduled Sampling (Cress) method. Specifically, we regularize the outputpredictions of ST and MT, whose target-side contexts are derived by samplingbetween ground truth words and self-generated words with a varying probability.Furthermore, we introduce token-level adaptive training which assigns differenttraining weights to target tokens to handle difficult cases with large modalitygaps. Experiments and analysis show that our approach effectively bridges themodality gap, and achieves promising results in all eight directions of theMuST-C dataset.</description><author>Qingkai Fang, Yang Feng</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 16:09:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08706v1</guid></item><item><title>Arbitrary Decisions are a Hidden Cost of Differentially Private Training</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14517v2</link><description>Mechanisms used in privacy-preserving machine learning often aim to guaranteedifferential privacy (DP) during model training. Practical DP-ensuring trainingmethods use randomization when fitting model parameters to privacy-sensitivedata (e.g., adding Gaussian noise to clipped gradients). We demonstrate thatsuch randomization incurs predictive multiplicity: for a given input example,the output predicted by equally-private models depends on the randomness usedin training. Thus, for a given input, the predicted output can vary drasticallyif a model is re-trained, even if the same training dataset is used. Thepredictive-multiplicity cost of DP training has not been studied, and iscurrently neither audited for nor communicated to model designers andstakeholders. We derive a bound on the number of re-trainings required toestimate predictive multiplicity reliably. We analyze--both theoretically andthrough extensive experiments--the predictive-multiplicity cost of threeDP-ensuring algorithms: output perturbation, objective perturbation, andDP-SGD. We demonstrate that the degree of predictive multiplicity rises as thelevel of privacy increases, and is unevenly distributed across individuals anddemographic groups in the data. Because randomness used to ensure DP duringtraining explains predictions for some examples, our results highlight afundamental challenge to the justifiability of decisions supported bydifferentially private models in high-stakes settings. We conclude thatpractitioners should audit the predictive multiplicity of their DP-ensuringalgorithms before deploying them in applications of individual-levelconsequence.</description><author>Bogdan Kulynych, Hsiang Hsu, Carmela Troncoso, Flavio P.

Before an upgraded PLM is released, we may have tuned the originalPLM for various tasks and stored the adapted weights. However, when tuning theupgraded PLM, these outdated adapted weights will typically be ignored anddiscarded, causing a potential waste of resources. We bring this issue to theforefront and contend that proper algorithms for recycling outdated adaptedweights should be developed. To this end, we formulate the task of recyclabletuning for continual pre-training. In pilot studies, we find that aftercontinual pre-training, the upgraded PLM remains compatible with the outdatedadapted weights to some extent. Motivated by this finding, we analyze theconnection between continually pre-trained PLMs from two novel aspects, i.e.,mode connectivity, and functional similarity. Based on the correspondingfindings, we propose both an initialization-based method and adistillation-based method for our task.

We here propose the quantum variationalinstruction set (QuVIS) formed by flexibly designed multi-qubit gates forhigher speed and accuracy of quantum computing. The controlling of qubits forrealizing the gates in a QuVIS is variationally achieved using the fine-grainedtime optimization algorithm. Significant reductions in both the erroraccumulation and time cost are demonstrated in realizing the swaps of multiplequbits and quantum Fourier transformations, compared with the compiling by astandard QIS such as the quantum microinstruction set (QuMIS, formed by severalone- and two-qubit gates including one-qubit rotations and controlled-NOTgates). With the same requirement on quantum hardware, the time cost for QuVISis reduced to less than one half of that for QuMIS. Simultaneously, the erroris suppressed algebraically as the depth of the compiled circuit is reduced. Asa general compiling approach with high flexibility and efficiency, QuVIS can bedefined for different quantum circuits and be adapted to the quantum hardwarewith different interactions.</description><author>Ying Lu, Peng-Fei Zhou, Shao-Ming Fei, Shi-Ju Ran</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 16:01:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15574v4</guid></item><item><title>Continual Multimodal Knowledge Graph Construction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08698v1</link><description>Multimodal Knowledge Graph Construction (MMKC) refers to the process ofcreating a structured representation of entities and relationships throughmultiple modalities such as text, images, videos, etc. However, existing MMKCmodels have limitations in handling the introduction of new entities andrelations due to the dynamic nature of the real world. Moreover, moststate-of-the-art studies in MMKC only consider entity and relation extractionfrom text data while neglecting other multi-modal sources. Meanwhile, thecurrent continual setting for knowledge graph construction only consider entityand relation extraction from text data while neglecting other multi-modalsources. Therefore, there arises the need to explore the challenge ofcontinuous multimodal knowledge graph construction to address the phenomenon ofcatastrophic forgetting and ensure the retention of past knowledge extractedfrom different forms of data. This research focuses on investigating thiscomplex topic by developing lifelong multimodal benchmark datasets.

However, neural-symbolic SR remains a challenging problemdue to open issues like representing users and items in logical reasoning. Inthis paper, we combine the Deep Neural Network (DNN) SR models with logicalreasoning and propose a general framework named Sequential Recommendation withProbabilistic Logical Reasoning (short for SR-PLR). This framework allowsSR-PLR to benefit from both similarity matching and logical reasoning bydisentangling feature embedding and logic embedding in the DNN andprobabilistic logic network. To better capture the uncertainty and evolution ofuser tastes, SR-PLR embeds users and items with a probabilistic method andconducts probabilistic logical reasoning on users' interaction patterns. Thenthe feature and logic representations learned from the DNN and logic networkare concatenated to make the prediction. Finally, experiments on varioussequential recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness of the SR-PLR.</description><author>Huanhuan Yuan, Pengpeng Zhao, Xuefeng Xian, Guanfeng Liu, Victor S.

We introduce an approach for equipping a simple language-to-codemodel to handle complex utterances via a process of hierarchical naturallanguage decomposition. Our approach uses a pre-trained language model todecompose a complex utterance into a sequence of smaller natural languagesteps, then interprets each step using the language-to-code model.

Predictiveuncertainty is typically categorized into aleatoric uncertainty and epistemicuncertainty. The former accounts for the inherent uncertainty in data and thelatter corresponds to the model uncertainty. Aiming for robust clean speechestimation and efficient predictive uncertainty quantification, we propose tointegrate statistical complex Gaussian mixture models (CGMMs) into a deepspeech enhancement framework. More specifically, we model the dependencybetween input and output stochastically by means of a conditional probabilitydensity and train a neural network to map the noisy input to the full posteriordistribution of clean speech, modeled as a mixture of multiple complex Gaussiancomponents. Experimental results on different datasets show that the proposedalgorithm effectively captures predictive uncertainty and that combiningpowerful statistical models and deep learning also delivers a superior speechenhancement performance.</description><author>Huajian Fang, Timo Gerkmann</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 15:32:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04831v2</guid></item><item><title>Improved baselines for vision-language pre-training</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08675v1</link><description>Contrastive learning has emerged as an efficient framework to learnmultimodal representations. CLIP, a seminal work in this area, achievedimpressive results by training on paired image-text data using the contrastiveloss. Recent work claims improvements over CLIP using additionalnon-contrastive losses inspired from self-supervised learning. However, it issometimes hard to disentangle the contribution of these additional losses fromother implementation details, e.g., data augmentation or regularizationtechniques, used to train the model. To shed light on this matter, in thispaper, we first propose, implement and evaluate several baselines obtained bycombining contrastive learning with recent advances in self-supervisedlearning. In particular, we use the loss functions that were proven successfulfor visual self-supervised learning to align image and text modalities. We findthat these baselines outperform a basic implementation of CLIP. However, when astronger training recipe is employed, the advantage disappears. Indeed, we findthat a simple CLIP baseline can also be improved substantially, up to a 25%relative improvement on downstream zero-shot tasks, by using well-knowntraining techniques that are popular in other subfields. Moreover, we discoverthat it is enough to apply image and text augmentations to make up for most ofthe improvement attained by prior works. With our improved training recipe forCLIP, we obtain state-of-the-art performance on four standard datasets, andconsistently outperform prior work (up to +4% on the largest dataset), whilebeing substantially simpler.</description><author>Enrico Fini, Pietro Astolfi, Adriana Romero-Soriano, Jakob Verbeek, Michal Drozdzal</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 15:31:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08675v1</guid></item><item><title>Discovery of sparse hysteresis models for piezoelectric materials</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05313v5</link><description>This article presents an approach for modelling hysteresis in piezoelectricmaterials, that leverages recent advancements in machine learning, particularlyin sparse-regression techniques. While sparse regression has previously beenused to model various scientific and engineering phenomena, its application tononlinear hysteresis modelling in piezoelectric materials has yet to beexplored. The study employs the least-squares algorithm with a sequentialthreshold to model the dynamic system responsible for hysteresis, resulting ina concise model that accurately predicts hysteresis for both simulated andexperimental piezoelectric material data. Several numerical experiments areperformed, including learning butterfly-shaped hysteresis and modellingreal-world hysteresis data for a piezoelectric actuator.

Accurate detection of traffic lights and correctidentification of their states is essential for safe autonomous operation incities. Herein, we describe our recently-redesigned traffic light perceptionsystem for autonomous vehicles like the University of Toronto's self-drivingcar, Artemis. Similar to most traffic light perception systems, we relyprimarily on camera-based object detectors. We deploy the YOLOv5 detector forbounding box regression and traffic light classification across multiplecameras and fuse the observations. To improve robustness, we incorporate priorsfrom high-definition semantic maps and perform state filtering using hiddenMarkov models. We demonstrate a multi-camera, real time-capable traffic lightperception pipeline that handles complex situations including multiple visibleintersections, traffic light variations, temporary occlusion, and flashinglight states. To validate our system, we collected and annotated a varieddataset incorporating flashing states and a range of occlusion types. Ourresults show superior performance in challenging real-world scenarios comparedto single-frame, single-camera object detection.</description><author>Sean Wu, Nicole Amenta, Jiachen Zhou, Sandro Papais, Jonathan Kelly</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 15:28:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08673v1</guid></item><item><title>Stochastic Texture Filtering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05810v2</link><description>2D texture maps and 3D voxel arrays are widely used to add rich detail to thesurfaces and volumes of rendered scenes, and filtered texture lookups areintegral to producing high-quality imagery. We show that filtering texturesafter evaluating lighting, rather than before BSDF evaluation as is currentpractice, gives a more accurate solution to the rendering equation. Thesebenefits are not merely theoretical, but are apparent in common cases. Wefurther show that stochastically sampling texture filters is crucial forenabling this approach, which has not been possible previously except inlimited cases. Stochastic texture filtering offers additional benefits,including efficient implementation of high-quality texture filters andefficient filtering of textures stored in compressed and sparse datastructures, including neural representations.

Furthermore, this error is handled well by eitherspatiotemporal denoising or moderate pixel sampling rates.</description><author>Marcos Fajardo, Bartlomiej Wronski, Marco Salvi, Matt Pharr</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 15:17:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05810v2</guid></item><item><title>MADDM: Multi-Advisor Dynamic Binary Decision-Making by Maximizing the Utility</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08664v1</link><description>Being able to infer ground truth from the responses of multiple imperfectadvisors is a problem of crucial importance in many decision-makingapplications, such as lending, trading, investment, and crowd-sourcing. Inpractice, however, gathering answers from a set of advisors has a cost.Therefore, finding an advisor selection strategy that retrieves a reliableanswer and maximizes the overall utility is a challenging problem. To addressthis problem, we propose a novel strategy for optimally selecting a set ofadvisers in a sequential binary decision-making setting, where multipledecisions need to be made over time. Crucially, we assume no access to groundtruth and no prior knowledge about the reliability of advisers. Specifically,our approach considers how to simultaneously (1) select advisors by balancingthe advisors' costs and the value of making correct decisions, (2) learn thetrustworthiness of advisers dynamically without prior information by askingmultiple advisers, and (3) make optimal decisions without access to the groundtruth, improving this over time. We evaluate our algorithm through severalnumerical experiments. The results show that our approach outperforms two othermethods that combine state-of-the-art models.</description><author>Zhaori Guo, Timothy J. Norman, Enrico H.

We propose an efficientone-stage training strategy for long-tailed visual recognition called Globaland Local Mixture Consistency cumulative learning (GLMC). Our core ideas aretwofold: (1) a global and local mixture consistency loss improves therobustness of the feature extractor. Specifically, we generate two augmentedbatches by the global MixUp and local CutMix from the same batch data,respectively, and then use cosine similarity to minimize the difference. (2) Acumulative head tail soft label reweighted loss mitigates the head class biasproblem. We use empirical class frequencies to reweight the mixed label of thehead-tail class for long-tailed data and then balance the conventional loss andthe rebalanced loss with a coefficient accumulated by epochs. Our approachachieves state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LTdatasets. Additional experiments on balanced ImageNet and CIFAR demonstratethat GLMC can significantly improve the generalization of backbones.

Yet, humans can easily understand and interpretmetaphors, similes or idioms as they can be derived from embodied metaphors.Language is a proxy for embodiment and if a metaphor is conventional andlexicalised, it becomes easier for a system without a body to make sense ofembodied concepts. Yet, the intricate relation between embodiment and featuressuch as concreteness or age of acquisition has not been studied in the contextof figurative language interpretation concerning language models. Hence, thepresented study shows how larger language models perform better at interpretingmetaphoric sentences when the action of the metaphorical sentence is moreembodied. The analysis rules out multicollinearity with other features (e.g.word length or concreteness) and provides initial evidence that larger languagemodels conceptualise embodied concepts to a degree that facilitates figurativelanguage understanding.</description><author>Philipp Wicke</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 15:06:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03445v2</guid></item><item><title>Segment anything, from space?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13000v2</link><description>Recently, the first foundation model developed specifically for vision taskswas developed, termed the "Segment Anything Model" (SAM). SAM can segmentobjects in input imagery based upon cheap input prompts, such as one (or more)points, a bounding box, or a mask. The authors examined the zero-shot imagesegmentation accuracy of SAM on a large number of vision benchmark tasks andfound that SAM usually achieved recognition accuracy similar to, or sometimesexceeding, vision models that had been trained on the target tasks. Theimpressive generalization of SAM for segmentation has major implications forvision researchers working on natural imagery. In this work, we examine whetherSAM's impressive performance extends to overhead imagery problems, and helpguide the community's response to its development. We examine SAM's performanceon a set of diverse and widely-studied benchmark tasks. We find that SAM doesoften generalize well to overhead imagery, although it fails in some cases dueto the unique characteristics of overhead imagery and the target objects. Wereport on these unique systematic failure cases for remote sensing imagery thatmay comprise useful future research for the community. Note that this is aworking paper, and it will be updated as additional analysis and results arecompleted.</description><author>Simiao Ren, Francesco Luzi, Saad Lahrichi, Kaleb Kassaw, Leslie M.

Machines and infrastructure are increasingly instrumented withsensing systems, emitting streams of telemetry data with complexinterdependencies. In practice, data-centric monitoring procedures tend toconsider these assets (and respective models) as distinct -- operating inisolation and associated with independent data. In contrast, this work capturesthe statistical correlations and interdependencies between models of a group ofsystems. Utilising a Bayesian multilevel approach, the value of data can beextended, since the population can be considered as a whole, rather thanconstituent parts. Most interestingly, domain expertise and knowledge of theunderlying physics can be encoded in the model at the system, subgroup, orpopulation level. We present an example of acoustic emission (time-of-arrival)mapping for source location, to illustrate how multilevel models naturally lendthemselves to representing aggregate systems in engineering. In particular, wefocus on constraining the combined models with domain knowledge to enhancetransfer learning and enable further insights at the population level.</description><author>Lawrence A.

However, PLMs are sensitive to thefrequency information of words from their pre-training corpora, resulting inanisotropic embedding space, where the embeddings of high-frequency words areclustered but those of low-frequency words disperse sparsely. This anisotropicphenomenon results in two problems of similarity bias and information bias,lowering the quality of sentence embeddings. To solve the problems, wefine-tune PLMs by leveraging the frequency information of words and propose anovel USRL framework, namely Sentence Representation Learning withFrequency-induced Adversarial tuning and Incomplete sentence filtering(SLT-FAI). We calculate the word frequencies over the pre-training corpora ofPLMs and assign words thresholding frequency labels. With them, (1) weincorporate a similarity discriminator used to distinguish the embeddings ofhigh-frequency and low-frequency words, and adversarially tune the PLM with it,enabling to achieve uniformly frequency-invariant embedding space; and (2) wepropose a novel incomplete sentence detection task, where we incorporate aninformation discriminator to distinguish the embeddings of original sentencesand incomplete sentences by randomly masking several low-frequency words,enabling to emphasize the more informative low-frequency words. Our SLT-FAI isa flexible and plug-and-play framework, and it can be integrated with existingUSRL techniques. We evaluate SLT-FAI with various backbones on benchmarkdatasets. Empirical results indicate that SLT-FAI can be superior to theexisting USRL baselines.

Detecting the semantic variation of words is animportant task for various NLP applications that must make time-sensitivepredictions. Existing work on semantic variation prediction have predominantlyfocused on comparing some form of an averaged contextualised representation ofa target word computed from a given corpus. However, some of the previouslyassociated meanings of a target word can become obsolete over time (e.g.meaning of gay as happy), while novel usages of existing words are observed(e.g. meaning of cell as a mobile phone). We argue that mean representationsalone cannot accurately capture such semantic variations and propose a methodthat uses the entire cohort of the contextualised embeddings of the targetword, which we refer to as the sibling distribution. Experimental results onSemEval-2020 Task 1 benchmark dataset for semantic variation prediction showthat our method outperforms prior work that consider only the mean embeddings,and is comparable to the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, a qualitativeanalysis shows that our method detects important semantic changes in words thatare not captured by the existing methods.

They use variants of Score Distillation Sampling(SDS), which is slow, somewhat unstable, and prone to artifacts. A mitigationis to fine-tune the 2D generator to be multi-view aware, which can helpdistillation or can be combined with reconstruction networks to output 3Dobjects directly. In this paper, we further explore the design space oftext-to-3D models. We significantly improve multi-view generation byconsidering video instead of image generators. Combined with a 3Dreconstruction algorithm which, by using Gaussian splatting, can optimize arobust image-based loss, we directly produce high-quality 3D outputs from thegenerated views. Our new method, IM-3D, reduces the number of evaluations ofthe 2D generator network 10-100x, resulting in a much more efficient pipeline,better quality, fewer geometric inconsistencies, and higher yield of usable 3Dassets.</description><author>Luke Melas-Kyriazi, Iro Laina, Christian Rupprecht, Natalia Neverova, Andrea Vedaldi, Oran Gafni, Filippos Kokkinos</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 18:59:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08682v1</guid></item><item><title>Mitigating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models via Classifier-Free Guidance</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08680v1</link><description>The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has increasinglyhighlighted the critical issue of their tendency to hallucinate non-existingobjects in the images. To address this issue, previous works focused on usingspecially curated datasets or powerful LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5) to rectify theoutputs of LVLMs. However, these approaches require either expensivetraining/fine-tuning or API access to advanced LLMs to correct the model'soutput post-generation. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducinga framework called Mitigating hallucinAtion via classifieR-Free guIdaNcE(MARINE), which is both training-free and API-free, and can effectively andefficiently reduce object hallucinations during the generation process.Specifically, MARINE enriches the visual context of LVLMs by integratingexisting open-source vision models, and employs classifier-free guidance toincorporate the additional object grounding features to improve the precisionof LVLMs' generations. Through comprehensive evaluations across $6$ popularLVLMs with diverse evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the effectiveness ofMARINE, which even outperforms existing fine-tuning-based methods. Remarkably,it not only reduces hallucinations but also improves the detailedness of LVLMs'generations, as assessed by GPT-4V.</description><author>Linxi Zhao, Yihe Deng, Weitong Zhang, Quanquan Gu</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 18:59:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08680v1</guid></item><item><title>COLD-Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness and Controllability</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08679v1</link><description>Jailbreaks on Large language models (LLMs) have recently received increasingattention. For a comprehensive assessment of LLM safety, it is essential toconsider jailbreaks with diverse attributes, such as contextual coherence andsentiment/stylistic variations, and hence it is beneficial to studycontrollable jailbreaking, i.e. how to enforce control on LLM attacks. In thispaper, we formally formulate the controllable attack generation problem, andbuild a novel connection between this problem and controllable text generation,a well-explored topic of natural language processing. Based on this connection,we adapt the Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics (COLD), astate-of-the-art, highly efficient algorithm in controllable text generation,and introduce the COLD-Attack framework which unifies and automates the searchof adversarial LLM attacks under a variety of control requirements such asfluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence. The controllabilityenabled by COLD-Attack leads to diverse new jailbreak scenarios which not onlycover the standard setting of generating fluent suffix attacks, but also allowus to address new controllable attack settings such as revising a user queryadversarially with minimal paraphrasing, and inserting stealthy attacks incontext with left-right-coherence. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs(Llama-2, Mistral, Vicuna, Guanaco, GPT-3.5) show COLD-Attack's broadapplicability, strong controllability, high success rate, and attacktransferability.

The majority of GNNs define a local message-passingmechanism, propagating information over the graph by stacking multiple layers.These methods, however, are known to suffer from two major limitations:over-squashing and poor capturing of long-range dependencies. Recently, GraphTransformers (GTs) emerged as a powerful alternative to Message-Passing NeuralNetworks (MPNNs). GTs, however, have quadratic computational cost, lackinductive biases on graph structures, and rely on complex Positional/StructuralEncodings (SE/PE). In this paper, we show that while Transformers, complexmessage-passing, and SE/PE are sufficient for good performance in practice,neither is necessary. Motivated by the recent success of State Space Models(SSMs), such as Mamba, we present Graph Mamba Networks (GMNs), a generalframework for a new class of GNNs based on selective SSMs. We discuss andcategorize the new challenges when adopting SSMs to graph-structured data, andpresent four required and one optional steps to design GMNs, where we choose(1) Neighborhood Tokenization, (2) Token Ordering, (3) Architecture ofBidirectional Selective SSM Encoder, (4) Local Encoding, and dispensable (5) PEand SE. We further provide theoretical justification for the power of GMNs.Experiments demonstrate that despite much less computational cost, GMNs attainan outstanding performance in long-range, small-scale, large-scale, andheterophilic benchmark datasets.</description><author>Ali Behrouz, Farnoosh Hashemi</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 18:58:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08678v1</guid></item><item><title>A Convergence Analysis of Approximate Message Passing with Non-Separable Functions and Applications to Multi-Class Classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08676v1</link><description>Motivated by the recent application of approximate message passing (AMP) tothe analysis of convex optimizations in multi-class classifications [Loureiro,et. al., 2021], we present a convergence analysis of AMP dynamics withnon-separable multivariate nonlinearities.

In tasks governed by succinct rules, learning ismore robust when related examples are blocked across trials, but in the absenceof such rules, interleaving is more effective. To date, no neural model hassimultaneously captured these seemingly contradictory effects. Here we showthat this same tradeoff spontaneously emerges with "in-context learning" (ICL)both in neural networks trained with metalearning and in large language models(LLMs). ICL is the ability to learn new tasks "in context" - without weightchanges - via an inner-loop algorithm implemented in activation dynamics.Experiments with pretrained LLMs and metalearning transformers show that ICLexhibits the blocking advantage demonstrated in humans on a task involvingrule-like structure, and conversely, that concurrent in-weight learningreproduces the interleaving advantage observed in humans on tasks lacking suchstructure.</description><author>Jacob Russin, Ellie Pavlick, Michael J.

This strategy also facilitates the comparison betweenany two candidate models by estimating the difference of their generalizationerrors. We further integrate pairwise comparisons into a single-eliminationtournament, achieving near-optimal model selection from a collection ofcandidates.

This setting is common amongspecialized human experts or specific focused studies. We lean on well-studiedparadoxes (Simpson's and Condorcet) to illustrate the more general difficultiesof causal inference in omitted label contexts. Contrary to the fundamentalprinciples on which much of causal inference is built, we show that ``correct''adjustments sometimes require non-exchangeable treatment and control groups.These pitfalls lead us to the study networks of conclusions drawn fromdifferent contexts and the structures the form, proving an interestingconnection between these networks and social choice theory.</description><author>Bijan Mazaheri, Siddharth Jain, Matthew Cook, Jehoshua Bruck</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 18:53:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06840v2</guid></item><item><title>Are Semi-Dense Detector-Free Methods Good at Matching Local Features?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08671v1</link><description>Semi-dense detector-free approaches (SDF), such as LoFTR, are currently amongthe most popular image matching methods. While SDF methods are trained toestablish correspondences between two images, their performances are almostexclusively evaluated using relative pose estimation metrics. Thus, the linkbetween their ability to establish correspondences and the quality of theresulting estimated pose has thus far received little attention. This paper isa first attempt to study this link. We start with proposing a novel structuredattention-based image matching architecture (SAM). It allows us to show acounter-intuitive result on two datasets (MegaDepth and HPatches): on the onehand SAM either outperforms or is on par with SDF methods in terms ofpose/homography estimation metrics, but on the other hand SDF approaches aresignificantly better than SAM in terms of matching accuracy. We then propose tolimit the computation of the matching accuracy to textured regions, and showthat in this case SAM often surpasses SDF methods. Our findings highlight astrong correlation between the ability to establish accurate correspondences intextured regions and the accuracy of the resulting estimated pose/homography.Our code will be made available.</description><author>Matthieu Vilain, RÃ©mi Giraud, Hugo Germain, Guillaume Bourmaud</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 18:53:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08671v1</guid></item><item><title>Rec-GPT4V: Multimodal Recommendation with Large Vision-Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08670v1</link><description>The development of large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers the potentialto address challenges faced by traditional multimodal recommendations thanks totheir proficient understanding of static images and textual dynamics. However,the application of LVLMs in this field is still limited due to the followingcomplexities: First, LVLMs lack user preference knowledge as they are trainedfrom vast general datasets. Second, LVLMs suffer setbacks in addressingmultiple image dynamics in scenarios involving discrete, noisy, and redundantimage sequences. To overcome these issues, we propose the novel reasoningscheme named Rec-GPT4V: Visual-Summary Thought (VST) of leveraging largevision-language models for multimodal recommendation. We utilize user historyas in-context user preferences to address the first challenge. Next, we promptLVLMs to generate item image summaries and utilize image comprehension innatural language space combined with item titles to query the user preferencesover candidate items. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four datasetswith three LVLMs: GPT4-V, LLaVa-7b, and LLaVa-13b. The numerical resultsindicate the efficacy of VST.</description><author>Yuqing Liu, Yu Wang, Lichao Sun, Philip S.

A well known limitation ofDenoising Score Matching, however, is that it yields poor estimates of thescore at low noise levels. This issue is particularly unfavourable for problemsin the physical sciences and for Monte Carlo sampling tasks for which the scoreof the clean original target is known. Intuitively, estimating the score of aslightly noised version of the target should be a simple task in such cases. Inthis paper, we address this shortcoming and show that it is indeed possible toleverage knowledge of the target score. We present a Target Score Identity andcorresponding Target Score Matching regression loss which allows us to obtainscore estimates admitting favourable properties at low noise levels.</description><author>Valentin De Bortoli, Michael Hutchinson, Peter Wirnsberger, Arnaud Doucet</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 18:48:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08667v1</guid></item><item><title>Improving Generalization in Semantic Parsing by Increasing Natural Language Variation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08666v1</link><description>Text-to-SQL semantic parsing has made significant progress in recent years,with various models demonstrating impressive performance on the challengingSpider benchmark. However, it has also been shown that these models oftenstruggle to generalize even when faced with small perturbations of previously(accurately) parsed expressions. This is mainly due to the linguistic form ofquestions in Spider which are overly specific, unnatural, and display limitedvariation. In this work, we use data augmentation to enhance the robustness oftext-to-SQL parsers against natural language variations. Existing approachesgenerate question reformulations either via models trained on Spider or onlyintroduce local changes. In contrast, we leverage the capabilities of largelanguage models to generate more realistic and diverse questions. Using only afew prompts, we achieve a two-fold increase in the number of questions inSpider. Training on this augmented dataset yields substantial improvements on arange of evaluation sets, including robustness benchmarks and out-of-domaindata.</description><author>Irina Saparina, Mirella Lapata</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 18:48:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08666v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning Emergent Gaits with Decentralized Phase Oscillators: on the role of Observations, Rewards, and Feedback</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08662v1</link><description>We present a minimal phase oscillator model for learning quadrupedallocomotion.

This research proposes a novelapproach to instruction tuning by integrating a structured cognitive learningmethodology that takes inspiration from the systematic progression andcognitively stimulating nature of human education through two key steps. First,our synthetic instruction data generation pipeline, designed with somereferences to human educational frameworks, is enriched with meta-datadetailing topics and cognitive rigor for each instruction. Specifically, ourgeneration framework is infused with questions of varying levels ofrigorousness, inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy, a classic educational model forstructured curriculum learning. Second, during instruction tuning, we curateinstructions such that questions are presented in an increasingly complexmanner utilizing the information on question complexity and cognitiverigorousness produced by our data generation pipeline. Our human-inspiredcurriculum learning yields significant performance enhancements compared touniform sampling or round-robin, improving MMLU by 3.06 on LLaMA 2. We conductextensive experiments and find that the benefits of our approach areconsistently observed in eight other benchmarks. We hope that our work willshed light on the post-training learning process of LLMs and its similaritywith their human counterpart.</description><author>Bruce W.

JITAIs are being explored as a key mechanism for sustainablebehavior change, adapting interventions to an individual's current context andneeds. However, traditional rule-based and machine learning models for JITAIimplementation face scalability and reliability limitations, such as lack ofpersonalization, difficulty in managing multi-parametric systems, and issueswith data sparsity. To investigate JITAI implementation via LLMs, we tested thecontemporary overall performance-leading model 'GPT-4' with examples groundedin the use case of fostering heart-healthy physical activity in outpatientcardiac rehabilitation. Three personas and five sets of context information perpersona were used as a basis of triggering and personalizing JITAIs.Subsequently, we generated a total of 450 proposed JITAI decisions and messagecontent, divided equally into JITAIs generated by 10 iterations with GPT-4, abaseline provided by 10 laypersons (LayPs), and a gold standard set by 10healthcare professionals (HCPs). Ratings from 27 LayPs indicated that JITAIsgenerated by GPT-4 were superior to those by HCPs and LayPs over all assessedscales: i.e., appropriateness, engagement, effectiveness, and professionality.This study indicates that LLMs have significant potential for implementingJITAIs as a building block of personalized or "precision" health, offeringscalability, effective personalization based on opportunistically sampledinformation, and good acceptability.</description><author>David Haag, Devender Kumar, Sebastian Gruber, Mahdi Sareban, Gunnar Treff, Josef Niebauer, Christopher Bull, Jan David Smeddinck</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 18:39:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08658v1</guid></item><item><title>PIN: Positional Insert Unlocks Object Localisation Abilities in VLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08657v1</link><description>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Flamingo and GPT-4V, have shownimmense potential by integrating large language models with vision systems.Nevertheless, these models face challenges in the fundamental computer visiontask of object localisation, due to their training on multimodal datacontaining mostly captions without explicit spatial grounding. While it ispossible to construct custom, supervised training pipelines with bounding boxannotations that integrate with VLMs, these result in specialized andhard-to-scale models. In this paper, we aim to explore the limits ofcaption-based VLMs and instead propose to tackle the challenge in a simplermanner by i) keeping the weights of a caption-based VLM frozen and ii) notusing any supervised detection data. To this end, we introduce aninput-agnostic Positional Insert (PIN), a learnable spatial prompt, containinga minimal set of parameters that are slid inside the frozen VLM, unlockingobject localisation capabilities. Our PIN module is trained with a simplenext-token prediction task on synthetic data without requiring the introductionof new output heads.

To this end, weintroduce AlpaGasus, which is finetuned on only 9k high-quality data filteredfrom the 52k Alpaca data. AlpaGasus significantly outperforms the originalAlpaca as evaluated by GPT-4 on multiple test sets and the controlled humanevaluation. Its 13B variant matches $&gt;90\%$ performance of its teacher LLM(i.e., Text-Davinci-003 generating the 52k data) on test tasks. It alsoprovides 5.7x faster training, reducing the training time for a 7B variant from80 minutes (for Alpaca) to 14 minutes. Moreover, the experiments prove theefficacy of our method across diverse datasets, base models, and LLM filters.Overall, AlpaGasus demonstrates a novel data-centric IFT paradigm that can begenerally applied to instruction-tuning data, leading to faster training andbetter instruction-following models.

In this work, we introduce a spectralframework known as SAGMAN for examining the stability of GNNs. This frameworkassesses the distance distortions that arise from the nonlinear mappings ofGNNs between the input and output manifolds: when two nearby nodes on the inputmanifold are mapped (through a GNN model) to two distant ones on the outputmanifold, it implies a large distance distortion and thus a poor GNN stability.We propose a distance-preserving graph dimension reduction (GDR) approach thatutilizes spectral graph embedding and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) tocreate low-dimensional input/output graph-based manifolds for meaningfulstability analysis. Our empirical evaluations show that SAGMAN effectivelyassesses the stability of each node when subjected to various edge or featureperturbations, offering a scalable approach for evaluating the stability ofGNNs, extending to applications within recommendation systems.

Recent studies have revealed that, like theirclassical counterparts, QML models based on Parametrized Quantum Circuits(PQCs) are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Moreover, the existence ofUniversal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) in the quantum domain has beendemonstrated theoretically in the context of quantum classifiers. In this work,we introduce QuGAP: a novel framework for generating UAPs for quantumclassifiers. We conceptualize the notion of additive UAPs for PQC-basedclassifiers and theoretically demonstrate their existence. We then utilizegenerative models (QuGAP-A) to craft additive UAPs and experimentally show thatquantum classifiers are susceptible to such attacks. Moreover, we formulate anew method for generating unitary UAPs (QuGAP-U) using quantum generativemodels and a novel loss function based on fidelity constraints.

However, the fundamental principles that contribute tothe success of residual learning remain elusive, thus hindering effectivetraining of plain nets with depth scalability. In this paper, we peek behindthe curtains of residual learning by uncovering the "dissipating inputs"phenomenon that leads to convergence failure in plain neural nets: the input isgradually compromised through plain layers due to non-linearities, resulting inchallenges of learning feature representations. We theoretically demonstratehow plain neural nets degenerate the input to random noise and emphasize thesignificance of a residual connection that maintains a better lower bound ofsurviving neurons as a solution. With our theoretical discoveries, we propose"The Plain Neural Net Hypothesis" (PNNH) that identifies the internal pathacross non-linear layers as the most critical part in residual learning, andestablishes a paradigm to support the training of deep plain neural nets devoidof residual connections. We thoroughly evaluate PNNH-enabled CNN architecturesand Transformers on popular vision benchmarks, showing on-par accuracy, up to0.3% higher training throughput, and 2x better parameter efficiency compared toResNets and vision Transformers.</description><author>Tunhou Zhang, Feng Yan, Hai Li, Yiran Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 18:24:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08645v1</guid></item><item><title>Tandem Transformers for Inference Efficient LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08644v1</link><description>The autoregressive nature of conventional large language models (LLMs)inherently limits inference speed, as tokens are generated sequentially. Whilespeculative and parallel decoding techniques attempt to mitigate this, theyface limitations: either relying on less accurate smaller models for generationor failing to fully leverage the base LLM's representations. We introduce a novel architecture, Tandem transformers, to address theseissues. This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive modeland (2) a large model operating in block mode (processing multiple tokenssimultaneously). The small model's predictive accuracy is substantiallyenhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations.On the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Geckodemonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over astandalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Ottermodel with comparable downstream performance. We further incorporate the tandemmodel within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the large modelvalidates tokens from the small model. This ensures that the Tandem ofPaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x fasterthan using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstreamtask accuracy.</description><author>Aishwarya P S, Pranav Ajit Nair, Yashas Samaga, Toby Boyd, Sanjiv Kumar, Prateek Jain, Praneeth Netrapalli</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 18:24:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08644v1</guid></item><item><title>SWAP: Sparse Entropic Wasserstein Regression for Robust Network Pruning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04918v3</link><description>This study tackles the issue of neural network pruning that inaccurategradients exist when computing the empirical Fisher Information Matrix (FIM).We introduce SWAP, an Entropic Wasserstein regression (EWR) network pruningformulation, capitalizing on the geometric attributes of the optimal transport(OT) problem.

Wepropose a modular solver for this RL objective, called controlled decoding(CD), which exerts control through a separate prefix scorer module. At trainingtime, the prefix scorer learns a value function for the reward, and it is usedat inference time to control the generation from a frozen base model, provablysampling from a solution to the RL objective. We empirically demonstrate thatCD is effective as a control mechanism on popular benchmarks. We also show thata single prefix scorer can learn multiple rewards and different rewardcombinations can be configurable at inference time, effectively solving amulti-objective RL problem with no additional training. We show that thebenefits of applying CD transfer to an unseen base model with no furthertuning. Finally, we show that CD can be applied in a blockwise decoding fashionat inference-time, essentially bridging the gap between the popular best-of-$n$strategy and token-level control through reinforcement learning.

The approachproposed in this paper is based on the Dempster-Shafer Theory (DSt) of evidenceand starts from the assumption that the observed CDMs are drawn from a familyof unknown distributions. The Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz (DKW) inequality isused to construct robust bounds on such a family of unknown distributionsstarting from a time series of CDMs. A DSt structure is then derived from theprobability boxes constructed with DKW inequality. The DSt structureencapsulates the uncertainty in the CDMs at every point along the time seriesand allows the computation of the belief and plausibility in the realisation ofa given probability of collision. The methodology proposed in this paper istested on a number of real events and compared against existing practices inthe European and French Space Agencies.

For a commonly used classof no-regret learning algorithms called mean-based algorithms, we show that (i)in standard (i.e., full-information) first-price auctions, the optimizer cannotget more than the Stackelberg utility -- a standard benchmark in theliterature, but (ii) in Bayesian first-price auctions, there are instanceswhere the optimizer can achieve much higher than the Stackelberg utility. On the other hand, Mansour et al.

For general Bayesian games, under a reasonable and necessarycondition, we prove that no-polytope-swap-regret algorithms are indeednecessary to cap the optimizer's utility and thus answer their open question.For Bayesian first-price auctions, we give a simple improvement of the standardalgorithm for minimizing the polytope swap regret by exploiting the structureof Bayesian first-price auctions.</description><author>Aviad Rubinstein, Junyao Zhao</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 18:03:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08637v1</guid></item><item><title>BdSLW60: A Word-Level Bangla Sign Language Dataset</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08635v1</link><description>Sign language discourse is an essential mode of daily communication for thedeaf and hard-of-hearing people.

In this paper, we address these challenges by creating acomprehensive BdSL word-level dataset named BdSLW60 in an unconstrained andnatural setting, allowing positional and temporal variations and allowing signusers to change hand dominance freely. The dataset encompasses 60 Bangla signwords, with a significant scale of 9307 video trials provided by 18 signersunder the supervision of a sign language professional. The dataset wasrigorously annotated and cross-checked by 60 annotators.

This latterobjective is called stability and is especially important when the state spaceis unbounded, such that the states can be arbitrarily far from each other andthe agent can drift far away from the desired states. For example, instochastic queuing networks, where queues of waiting jobs can grow withoutbound, the desired state is all-zero queue lengths. Here, a stable policyensures queue lengths are finite while an optimal policy minimizes queuelengths. Since an optimal policy is also stable, one would expect that RLalgorithms would implicitly give us stable policies. However, in this work, wefind that deep RL algorithms that directly minimize the distance to the desiredstate during online training often result in unstable policies, i.e., policiesthat drift far away from the desired state. We attribute this instability topoor credit-assignment for destabilizing actions.

The commonly used maximum likelihoodestimator for hyperparameters of the Gaussian process is consistent only if thedata fills the space uniformly, which does not have to be the case in Bayesianoptimisation. Since no guarantees exist regarding the correctness ofhyperparameter estimation, and those hyperparameters can significantly affectthe Gaussian process fit, theoretical analysis of Bayesian optimisation withunknown hyperparameters is very challenging. Previously proposed algorithmswith the no-regret property were only able to handle the special case ofunknown lengthscales, reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm and applied only tothe frequentist case. We propose a novel algorithm, HE-GP-UCB, which is thefirst algorithm enjoying the no-regret property in the case of unknownhyperparameters of arbitrary form, and which supports both Bayesian andfrequentist settings. Our proof idea is novel and can easily be extended toother variants of Bayesian optimisation.

This paper focuses on the economicaspects of these challenges, emphasizing that the economic impact constitutes acentral issue in the copyright arena. The complexity of the black-boxgenerative AI technologies not only suggests but necessitates algorithmicsolutions. However, such solutions have been largely missing, leading toregulatory challenges in this landscape. We aim to bridge the gap in currentapproaches by proposing potential royalty models for revenue sharing on AImusic generation platforms. Our methodology involves a detailed analysis ofexisting royalty models in platforms like Spotify and YouTube, and adaptingthese to the unique context of AI-generated music. A significant challenge weaddress is the attribution of AI-generated music to influential copyrightedcontent in the training data.

Lately, hypergraph-baseddeep learning methods to learn informative data representations for the problemof node classification on text-attributed hypergraphs have garnered increasingresearch attention. However, existing methods struggle to simultaneouslycapture the full extent of hypergraph structural information and the richlinguistic attributes inherent in the nodes attributes, which largely hamperstheir effectiveness and generalizability. To overcome these challenges, weexplore ways to further augment a pretrained BERT model with specializedhypergraph-aware layers for the task of node classification. Such layersintroduce higher-order structural inductive bias into the language model, thusimproving the model's capacity to harness both higher-order context informationfrom the hypergraph structure and semantic information present in text. In thispaper, we propose a new architecture, HyperBERT, a mixed text-hypergraph modelwhich simultaneously models hypergraph relational structure while maintainingthe high-quality text encoding capabilities of a pre-trained BERT. Notably,HyperBERT presents results that achieve a new state-of-the-art on fivechallenging text-attributed hypergraph node classification benchmarks.</description><author>AdriÃ¡n Bazaga, Pietro LiÃ², Gos Micklem</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 17:24:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07309v2</guid></item><item><title>Mixtures of Experts Unlock Parameter Scaling for Deep RL</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08609v1</link><description>The recent rapid progress in (self) supervised learning models is in largepart predicted by empirical scaling laws: a model's performance scalesproportionally to its size.

In this work, we introduce a novel framework forpolicy optimization based on mirror descent that naturally accommodates generalparameterizations. The policy class induced by our scheme recovers knownclasses, e.g., softmax, and generates new ones depending on the choice ofmirror map. Using our framework, we obtain the first result that guaranteeslinear convergence for a policy-gradient-based method involving generalparameterization. To demonstrate the ability of our framework to accommodategeneral parameterization schemes, we provide its sample complexity when usingshallow neural networks, show that it represents an improvement upon theprevious best results, and empirically validate the effectiveness of ourtheoretical claims on classic control tasks.</description><author>Carlo Alfano, Rui Yuan, Patrick Rebeschini</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 17:18:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13139v4</guid></item><item><title>Neural Algorithmic Reasoning for Combinatorial Optimisation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06064v5</link><description>Solving NP-hard/complete combinatorial problems with neural networks is achallenging research area that aims to surpass classical approximatealgorithms.

The goal is to designexperiment selection rules for more accurate model estimation. Greedyinformation-based experiment selection methods, optimizing the information gainfor one-step ahead, have been employed in practice thanks to theircomputational convenience, flexibility to context or task changes, and broadapplicability. However, statistical analysis is restricted to one-dimensionalcases due to the problem's combinatorial nature and the seemingly limitedcapacity of greedy algorithms, leaving the multidimensional problem open. In this study, we close the gap for multidimensional problems. In particular,we propose adopting a class of greedy experiment selection methods and providestatistical analysis for the maximum likelihood estimator following theseselection rules. This class encompasses both existing methods and introducesnew methods with improved numerical efficiency. We prove that these methodsproduce consistent and asymptotically normal estimators. Additionally, within adecision theory framework, we establish that the proposed methods achieveasymptotic optimality when the risk measure aligns with the selection rule. Wealso conduct extensive numerical studies on both simulated and real data toillustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.

Our approach comprisesthree stages: text optimization, latent inversion, and timestep-aware textinjection sampling. Inspired by the recent success of Imagic, we employ theirtext optimization for smooth editing. Then, we introduce latent inversion topreserve the input image's identity without additional model fine-tuning. Tofully utilize the input reconstruction ability of latent inversion, we suggesttimestep-aware text inject sampling. This effectively retains the structure ofthe input image by injecting the source text prompt in early sampling steps andthen transitioning to the target prompt in subsequent sampling steps. Thisstrategic approach seamlessly harmonizes with text optimization, facilitatingcomplex non-rigid edits to the input without losing the original identity. Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of identity preservation,editability, and aesthetic quality through extensive experiments.</description><author>Yunji Jung, Seokju Lee, Tair Djanibekov, Hyunjung Shim, Jongchul Ye</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 17:08:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08601v1</guid></item><item><title>Homomorphism Counts for Graph Neural Networks: All About That Basis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08595v1</link><description>Graph neural networks are architectures for learning invariant functions overgraphs.

Their inability to count certain patterns (e.g., cycles) in agraph lies at the heart of such limitations, since many functions to be learnedrely on the ability of counting such patterns. Two prominent paradigms aim toaddress this limitation by enriching the graph features with subgraph orhomomorphism pattern counts. In this work, we show that both of theseapproaches are sub-optimal in a certain sense and argue for a more fine-grainedapproach, which incorporates the homomorphism counts of all structures in the"basis" of the target pattern. This yields strictly more expressivearchitectures without incurring any additional overhead in terms ofcomputational complexity compared to existing approaches.

These methods generallyinvolve individually training prompts for each source task and then aggregatingthem to provide the initialization of the prompt for the target task. However,this approach critically ignores the fact that some of the source tasks couldbe negatively or positively interfering with each other. We argue that when weextract knowledge from source tasks via training source prompts, we need toconsider this correlation among source tasks for better transfer to targettasks. To this end, we propose a Bayesian approach where we work with theposterior distribution of prompts across source tasks. We obtain representativesource prompts corresponding to the samples from the posterior utilizing SteinVariational Gradient Descent, which are then aggregated to constitute theinitial target prompt. We show extensive experimental results on the standardbenchmark NLP tasks, where our Bayesian multi-task transfer learning approachoutperforms the state-of-the-art methods in many settings.

There has been significant research ondesigning approaches to construct such examples for tree ensembles. But this isa computationally challenging problem that often must be solved a large numberof times (e.g., for all examples in a training set). This is compounded by thefact that current approaches attempt to find such examples from scratch. Incontrast, we exploit the fact that multiple similar problems are being solved.Specifically, our approach exploits the insight that adversarial examples fortree ensembles tend to perturb a consistent but relatively small set offeatures.

Theemergence of activation sparsity in LLMs provides a natural approach to reducethis cost by involving only parts of the parameters for inference. Existingmethods only focus on utilizing this naturally formed activation sparsity,overlooking the potential for further amplifying this inherent sparsity. Inthis paper, we hypothesize that LLMs can learn to be efficient by achievingmore structured activation sparsity.

Furthermore, unlike SOTA MoEfication methods, whichmainly focus on ReLU-based models, LTE can also be applied to LLMs like GPT andLLaMA with soft activation functions. We evaluate LTE on four models and elevendatasets. The experiments show that LTE achieves a better trade-off betweensparsity and task performance.

Amortized variational inference (A-VI) instead learns a commoninference function, which maps each observation to its corresponding latentvariable's approximate posterior. Typically, A-VI is used as a cog in thetraining of variational autoencoders, however it stands to reason that A-VIcould also be used as a general alternative to F-VI. In this paper we studywhen and why A-VI can be used for approximate Bayesian inference. We deriveconditions on a latent variable model which are necessary, sufficient, andverifiable under which A-VI can attain F-VI's optimal solution, thereby closingthe amortization gap. We prove these conditions are uniquely verified by simplehierarchical models, a broad class that encompasses many models in machinelearning. We then show, on a broader class of models, how to expand the domainof AVI's inference function to improve its solution, and we provide examples,e.g. hidden Markov models, where the amortization gap cannot be closed.</description><author>Charles C.

With this dataset wepropose a significantly larger, more diverse, and higher resolution set ofmaterials than previously publicly available. We carefully discuss the datacollection process and demonstrate the benefits of this dataset on materialacquisition and generation applications. The complete data further containsmetadata with each material's origin, license, category, tags, creation methodand, when available, descriptions and physical size, as well as 3M+ renderingsof the augmented materials, in 1K, under various environment lightings. TheMatSynth dataset is released through the project page at:https://www.gvecchio.com/matsynth.</description><author>Giuseppe Vecchio, Valentin Deschaintre</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 16:31:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06056v2</guid></item><item><title>Training Coupled Phase Oscillators as a Neuromorphic Platform using Equilibrium Propagation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08579v1</link><description>Given the rapidly growing scale and resource requirements of machine learningapplications, the idea of building more efficient learning machines much closerto the laws of physics is an attractive proposition. One central question foridentifying promising candidates for such neuromorphic platforms is whether notonly inference but also training can exploit the physical dynamics. In thiswork, we show that it is possible to successfully train a system of coupledphase oscillators - one of the most widely investigated nonlinear dynamicalsystems with a multitude of physical implementations, comprising laser arrays,coupled mechanical limit cycles, superfluids, and exciton-polaritons. To thisend, we apply the approach of equilibrium propagation, which permits to extracttraining gradients via a physical realization of backpropagation, based only onlocal interactions. The complex energy landscape of the XY/ Kuramoto modelleads to multistability, and we show how to address this challenge. Our studyidentifies coupled phase oscillators as a new general-purpose neuromorphicplatform and opens the door towards future experimental implementations.</description><author>Qingshan Wang, Clara C.

By collaboratively optimizing the global machine learning models ondistributed edge devices, FL circumvents the need for transmitting raw data andenhances user privacy. Despite practical successes, FL still confrontssignificant challenges including constrained edge device resources, multipletasks deployment, and data heterogeneity. However, existing studies focus onmitigating the FL training costs of each single task whereas neglecting theresource consumption across multiple tasks in heterogeneous FL scenarios. Inthis paper, we propose Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Local ParameterSharing (FedLPS) to fill this gap. FedLPS leverages principles from transferlearning to facilitate the deployment of multiple tasks on a single device bydividing the local model into a shareable encoder and task-specific encoders.To further reduce resource consumption, a channel-wise model pruning algorithmthat shrinks the footprint of local models while accounting for both data andsystem heterogeneity is employed in FedLPS. Additionally, a novel heterogeneousmodel aggregation algorithm is proposed to aggregate the heterogeneouspredictors in FedLPS. We implemented the proposed FedLPS on a real FL platformand compared it with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FL frameworks. The experimentalresults on five popular datasets and two modern DNN models illustrate that theproposed FedLPS significantly outperforms the SOTA FL frameworks by up to 4.88%and reduces the computational resource consumption by 21.3%.

In this work, we present AnyDoor, a test-time backdoor attack againstmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), which involves injecting the backdoorinto the textual modality using adversarial test images (sharing the sameuniversal perturbation), without requiring access to or modification of thetraining data. AnyDoor employs similar techniques used in universal adversarialattacks, but distinguishes itself by its ability to decouple the timing ofsetup and activation of harmful effects. In our experiments, we validate theeffectiveness of AnyDoor against popular MLLMs such as LLaVA-1.5, MiniGPT-4,InstructBLIP, and BLIP-2, as well as provide comprehensive ablation studies.Notably, because the backdoor is injected by a universal perturbation, AnyDoorcan dynamically change its backdoor trigger prompts/harmful effects, exposing anew challenge for defending against backdoor attacks.

Witha deep neural network employed as the backbone model, the data selectionprocess is highly challenging due to the potential over-confidence of the modelinference. Existing methods resort to special learning fashions (e.g.adversarial) or auxiliary models to address this challenge. This tends toresult in complex and inefficient pipelines, which would render the methodsimpractical. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm that leverages noisestability to estimate data uncertainty. The key idea is to measure the outputderivation from the original observation when the model parameters are randomlyperturbed by noise. We provide theoretical analyses by leveraging the smallGaussian noise theory and demonstrate that our method favors a subset withlarge and diverse gradients. Our method is generally applicable in varioustasks, including computer vision, natural language processing, and structuraldata analysis.

Stackelberggames are perhaps one of the biggest success stories of algorithmic game theoryover the last decade, as algorithms for playing in Stackelberg games have beendeployed in many real-world domains including airport security, anti-poachingefforts, and cyber-crime prevention. However, these algorithms often fail totake into consideration the additional information available to each player(e.g. traffic patterns, weather conditions, network congestion), a salientfeature of reality which may significantly affect both players' optimalstrategies. We formalize such settings as Stackelberg games with sideinformation, in which both players observe an external context before playing.The leader then commits to a (possibly context-dependent) strategy, and thefollower best-responds to both the leader's strategy and the context. We focuson the online setting in which a sequence of followers arrive over time, andthe context may change from round-to-round. In sharp contrast to thenon-contextual version, we show that it is impossible for the leader to achievegood performance (measured by regret) in the full adversarial setting (i.e.,when both the context and the follower are chosen by an adversary). However, itturns out that a little bit of randomness goes a long way. Motivated by ourimpossibility result, we show that no-regret learning is possible in twonatural relaxations: the setting in which the sequence of followers is chosenstochastically and the sequence of contexts is adversarial, and the setting inwhich the sequence of contexts is stochastic and the sequence of followers ischosen by an adversary.</description><author>Keegan Harris, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Maria-Florina Balcan</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 16:24:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08576v1</guid></item><item><title>Two Tales of Single-Phase Contrastive Hebbian Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08573v1</link><description>The search for "biologically plausible" learning algorithms has converged onthe idea of representing gradients as activity differences. However, mostapproaches require a high degree of synchronization (distinct phases duringlearning) and introduce substantial computational overhead, which raises doubtsregarding their biological plausibility as well as their potential utility forneuromorphic computing. Furthermore, they commonly rely on applyinginfinitesimal perturbations (nudges) to output units, which is impractical innoisy environments. Recently it has been shown that by modelling artificialneurons as dyads with two oppositely nudged compartments, it is possible for afully local learning algorithm named ``dual propagation'' to bridge theperformance gap to backpropagation, without requiring separate learning phasesor infinitesimal nudging. However, the algorithm has the drawback that itsnumerical stability relies on symmetric nudging, which may be restrictive inbiological and analog implementations. In this work we first provide a solidfoundation for the objective underlying the dual propagation method, which alsoreveals a surprising connection with adversarial robustness. Second, wedemonstrate how dual propagation is related to a particular adjoint statemethod, which is stable regardless of asymmetric nudging.</description><author>Rasmus KjÃ¦r HÃ¸ier, Christopher Zach</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 16:21:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08573v1</guid></item><item><title>This Land is {Your, My} Land: Evaluating Geopolitical Biases in Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14610v3</link><description>Do the Spratly Islands belong to China, the Philippines, or Vietnam? Apretrained large language model (LLM) may answer differently if asked in thelanguages of each claimant country: Chinese, Tagalog, or Vietnamese.

Inthis paper, we show that LLMs recall certain geographical knowledgeinconsistently when queried in different languages--a phenomenon we termgeopolitical bias. As a targeted case study, we consider territorial disputes,an inherently controversial and multilingual task. We introduce BorderLines, adataset of territorial disputes which covers 251 territories, each associatedwith a set of multiple-choice questions in the languages of each claimantcountry (49 languages in total). We also propose a suite of evaluation metricsto precisely quantify bias and consistency in responses across differentlanguages. We then evaluate various multilingual LLMs on our dataset andmetrics to probe their internal knowledge and use the proposed metrics todiscover numerous inconsistencies in how these models respond in differentlanguages. Finally, we explore several prompt modification strategies, aimingto either amplify or mitigate geopolitical bias, which highlights how brittleLLMs are and how they tailor their responses depending on cues from theinteraction context.</description><author>Bryan Li, Samar Haider, Chris Callison-Burch</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 16:18:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14610v3</guid></item><item><title>Tree Search in DAG Space with Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Causal Discovery</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13576v2</link><description>Identifying causal structure is central to many fields ranging from strategicdecision-making to biology and economics.

The models are accessible intwo ways: open-source or paid, closed-source options. Users with access to bothface a problem when deciding between effective yet costly closed-source modelsand free but less powerful open-source alternatives. We call it the modelselection problem. Existing supervised-learning methods are impractical due tothe high cost of collecting extensive training data from closed-source models.Hence, we focus on the online learning setting where algorithms learn whilecollecting data, eliminating the need for large pre-collected datasets. We thusformulate a user-centric online model selection problem and propose a novelsolution that combines an open-source encoder to output context and an onlinelearning algorithm that processes this context. The encoder distills vast datadistributions into low-dimensional features, i.e., the context, withoutadditional training. The online learning algorithm aims to maximize a compositereward that includes model performance, execution time, and costs based on thecontext extracted from the data. It results in an improved trade-off betweenselecting open-source and closed-source models compared to non-contextualmethods, as validated by our theoretical analysis. Experiments acrosslanguage-based robotic tasks such as Waymo Open Dataset, ALFRED, and OpenX-Embodiment demonstrate real-world applications of the solution.

In this work, we report aneven more severe safety issue in multi-agent environments, referred to asinfectious jailbreak. It entails the adversary simply jailbreaking a singleagent, and without any further intervention from the adversary, (almost) allagents will become infected exponentially fast and exhibit harmful behaviors.To validate the feasibility of infectious jailbreak, we simulate multi-agentenvironments containing up to one million LLaVA-1.5 agents, and employrandomized pair-wise chat as a proof-of-concept instantiation for multi-agentinteraction. Our results show that feeding an (infectious) adversarial imageinto the memory of any randomly chosen agent is sufficient to achieveinfectious jailbreak.

More recently, they have been employed togenerate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). However, theystill struggle with inverse problems in the Laplacian operator, for instance,the Poisson equation, because the eigenvalues that are large in magnitudeamplify the measurement noise. This paper presents a novel approach for theinverse and forward solution of PDEs through the use of denoising diffusionrestoration models (DDRM). DDRMs were used in linear inverse problems torestore original clean signals by exploiting the singular value decomposition(SVD) of the linear operator. Equivalently, we present an approach to restorethe solution and the parameters in the Poisson equation by exploiting theeigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator.

Despitepromising results, research on improving the efficiency of LoRA with MoE isstill in its early stages. Recent studies have shown that experts in the MoEarchitecture have different strengths and also exhibit some redundancy. Doesthis statement also apply to parameter-efficient MoE?

Theinformation explosion drives many enterprises or individuals to seek to rentcloud computing infrastructure to put their applications in the cloud. However,the agreements reached between cloud computing providers and clients are oftennot efficient. Many factors affect the efficiency, such as the idleness of theproviders' cloud computing infrastructure, and the additional cost to theclients. One possible solution is to introduce a comprehensive, bargaining game(a type of negotiation), and schedule resources according to the negotiationresults. We propose an agent-based auto-negotiation system for resourcescheduling based on fuzzy logic. The proposed method can complete a one-to-oneauto-negotiation process and generate optimal offers for the provider andclient. We compare the impact of different member functions, fuzzy rule sets,and negotiation scenario cases on the offers to optimize the system. It can beconcluded that our proposed method can utilize resources more efficiently andis interpretable, highly flexible, and customizable. We successfully trainmachine learning models to replace the fuzzy negotiation system to improveprocessing speed. The article also highlights possible future improvements tothe proposed system and machine learning models.

While optimizingdownstream reward models has emerged as a promising alignment strategy,concerns arise regarding the risk of excessive optimization with learned rewardmodels, which potentially compromises ground-truth performance. In this work,we confront the reward overoptimization problem in diffusion model alignmentthrough the lenses of both inductive and primacy biases. We first identify thedivergence of current methods from the temporal inductive bias inherent in themulti-step denoising process of diffusion models as a potential source ofoveroptimization. Then, we surprisingly discover that dormant neurons in ourcritic model act as a regularization against overoptimization, while activeneurons reflect primacy bias in this setting. Motivated by these observations,we propose Temporal Diffusion Policy Optimization with critic active neuronReset (TDPO-R), a policy gradient algorithm that exploits the temporalinductive bias of intermediate timesteps, along with a novel reset strategythat targets active neurons to counteract the primacy bias. Empirical resultsdemonstrate the superior efficacy of our algorithms in mitigating rewardoveroptimization.</description><author>Ziyi Zhang, Sen Zhang, Yibing Zhan, Yong Luo, Yonggang Wen, Dacheng Tao</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 15:55:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08552v1</guid></item><item><title>Dueling Over Dessert, Mastering the Art of Repeated Cake Cutting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08547v1</link><description>We consider the setting of repeated fair division between two players,denoted Alice and Bob, with private valuations over a cake. In each round, anew cake arrives, which is identical to the ones in previous rounds. Alice cutsthe cake at a point of her choice, while Bob chooses the left piece or theright piece, leaving the remainder for Alice. We consider two versions:sequential, where Bob observes Alice's cut point before choosing left/right,and simultaneous, where he only observes her cut point after making his choice.The simultaneous version was first considered by Aumann and Maschler (1995). We observe that if Bob is almost myopic and chooses his favorite piece toooften, then he can be systematically exploited by Alice through a strategy akinto a binary search. This strategy allows Alice to approximate Bob's preferenceswith increasing precision, thereby securing a disproportionate share of theresource over time. We analyze the limits of how much a player can exploit the other one and showthat fair utility profiles are in fact achievable. Specifically, the playerscan enforce the equitable utility profile of $(1/2, 1/2)$ in the limit on everytrajectory of play, by keeping the other player's utility to approximately$1/2$ on average while guaranteeing they themselves get at least approximately$1/2$ on average.

These AIcorrectors are auxiliary maps whose role is to moderate the decisions of somepreviously constructed underlying classifier by either approving or rejectingits decisions. The rejection of a decision can be used as a signal to suggestabstaining from making a decision. A key technical focus of the work is inproviding performance guarantees for these new AI correctors through bounds onthe probabilities of incorrect decisions. These bounds are distributionagnostic and do not rely on assumptions on the data dimension. Our empiricalexample illustrates how the framework can be applied to improve the performanceof an image classifier in a challenging real-world task where training data arescarce.</description><author>Ivan Y.

These safety properties of DNNs can be proven usingtools developed by the verification community. However, these tools arethemselves prone to implementation bugs and numerical stability problems, whichmake their reliability questionable. To overcome this, some verifiers produceproofs of their results which can be checked by a trusted checker. In thiswork, we present a novel implementation of a proof checker for DNNverification. It improves on existing implementations by offering numericalstability and greater verifiability. To achieve this, we leverage two keycapabilities of Imandra, an industrial theorem prover: its support of infiniteprecision real arithmetic and its formal verification infrastructure. So far,we have implemented a proof checker in Imandra, specified its correctnessproperties and started to verify the checker's compliance with them. Ourongoing work focuses on completing the formal verification of the checker andfurther optimizing its performance.</description><author>Remi Desmartin, Omri Isac, Grant Passmore, Kathrin Stark, Guy Katz, Ekaterina Komendantskaya</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 15:51:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06299v2</guid></item><item><title>Setting the Record Straight on Transformer Oversmoothing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04301v2</link><description>Transformer-based models have recently become wildly successful across adiverse set of domains. At the same time, recent work has argued thatTransformers are inherently low-pass filters that gradually oversmooth theinputs. This is worrisome as it limits generalization, especially as modeldepth increases. A natural question is: How can Transformers achieve thesesuccesses given this shortcoming? In this work we show that in factTransformers are not inherently low-pass filters. Instead, whether Transformersoversmooth or not depends on the eigenspectrum of their update equations.Further, depending on the task, smoothing does not harm generalization as modeldepth increases. Our analysis extends prior work in oversmoothing and in theclosely-related phenomenon of rank collapse. Based on this analysis, we derivea simple way to parameterize the weights of the Transformer update equationsthat allows for control over its filtering behavior. For image classificationtasks we show that smoothing, instead of sharpening, can improvegeneralization. Whereas for text generation tasks Transformers that are forcedto either smooth or sharpen have worse generalization. We hope that this workgives ML researchers and practitioners additional insight and leverage whendeveloping future Transformer models.</description><author>GbÃ¨tondji J-S Dovonon, Michael M.

Weapply these models in the case of airfoil/hydrofoil design and conduct thecomparison on the resulting design spaces. A conventional GenerativeAdversarial Network (GAN) and a state-of-the-art generative model, thePerformance-Augmented Diverse Generative Adversarial Network (PaDGAN), arejuxtaposed with a linear non-generative model based on the coupling of theKarhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion and a physics-informed Shape Signature Vector(SSV-KLE). The comparison demonstrates that, with an appropriate shape encodingand a physics-augmented design space, non-generative models have the potentialto cost-effectively generate high-performing valid designs with enhancedcoverage of the design space. In this work, both approaches are applied to twolarge foil profile datasets comprising real-world and artificial designsgenerated through either a profile-generating parametric model or deep-learningapproach. These datasets are further enriched with integral properties of theirmembers' shapes as well as physics-informed parameters. Our results illustratethat the design spaces constructed by the non-generative model outperform thegenerative model in terms of design validity, generating robust latent spaceswith none or significantly fewer invalid designs when compared to generativemodels. We aspire that these findings will aid the engineering design communityin making informed decisions when constructing designs spaces for shapeoptimization, as we have show that under certain conditions computationallyinexpensive approaches can closely match or even outperform state-of-the artgenerative models.</description><author>Muhammad Usama, Zahid Masood, Shahroz Khan, Konstantinos Kostas, Panagiotis Kaklis</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 15:45:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08540v1</guid></item><item><title>Intelligent Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Machine Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08539v1</link><description>This study is based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)dataset and aims to explore early detection and disease progression inAlzheimer's disease (AD).

Four related Stock Market time series areused as input data, with the prediction focused on one of them. Hyperparameteroptimization for each architecture class was conducted to compare thebest-performing neural networks within each class. The results indicate that,in most cases, architectures with hypercomplex dense layers achieve similarMean Absolute Error (MAE) accuracy compared to other architectures, but withsignificantly fewer trainable parameters. Consequently, hypercomplex neuralnetworks demonstrate the ability to learn and process time series data fasterthan the other tested architectures.

The recent advent of foundational models like theDINOv2, which uses the vision transformer architecture, has opened newopportunities in the field and gathered significant interest. However, DINOv2'sperformance on clinical data still needs to be verified. In this paper, weperformed a glioma grading task using three clinical modalities of brain MRIdata. We compared the performance of various pre-trained deep learning models,including those based on ImageNet and DINOv2, in a transfer learning context.Our focus was on understanding the impact of the freezing mechanism onperformance. We also validated our findings on three other types of publicdatasets: chest radiography, fundus radiography, and dermoscopy. Our findingsindicate that in our clinical dataset, DINOv2's performance was not as strongas ImageNet-based pre-trained models, whereas in public datasets, DINOv2generally outperformed other models, especially when using the frozenmechanism. Similar performance was observed with various sizes of DINOv2 modelsacross different tasks. In summary, DINOv2 is viable for medical imageclassification tasks, particularly with data resembling natural images.However, its effectiveness may vary with data that significantly differs fromnatural images such as MRI. In addition, employing smaller versions of themodel can be adequate for medical task, offering resource-saving benefits.

In TBWMs, the world model consumes agent experienceas a language-like sequence of tokens, where each observation constitutes asub-sequence. However, during imagination, the sequential token-by-tokengeneration of next observations results in a severe bottleneck, leading to longtraining times, poor GPU utilization, and limited representations. To resolvethis bottleneck, we devise a novel Parallel Observation Prediction (POP)mechanism. POP augments a Retentive Network (RetNet) with a novel forward modetailored to our reinforcement learning setting. We incorporate POP in a novelTBWM agent named REM (Retentive Environment Model), showcasing a 15.4x fasterimagination compared to prior TBWMs. REM attains superhuman performance on 12out of 26 games of the Atari 100K benchmark, while training in less than 12hours.

Analogous to how the successor representation (SR)describes the expected consequences of behaving according to a given policy,our distributional successor measure (SM) describes the distributionalconsequences of this behaviour. We formulate the distributional SM as adistribution over distributions and provide theory connecting it withdistributional and model-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose analgorithm that learns the distributional SM from data by minimizing a two-levelmaximum mean discrepancy. Key to our method are a number of algorithmictechniques that are independently valuable for learning generative models ofstate. As an illustration of the usefulness of the distributional SM, we showthat it enables zero-shot risk-sensitive policy evaluation in a way that wasnot previously possible.</description><author>Harley Wiltzer, Jesse Farebrother, Arthur Gretton, Yunhao Tang, AndrÃ© Barreto, Will Dabney, Marc G.

Ofparticular interest are $E(3)$ equivariant point cloud networks where Euclideantransformations applied to the inputs are preserved in the outputs. Recentefforts aim to extend networks that are $E(3)$ equivariant, to accommodateinputs made of multiple parts, each of which exhibits local $E(3)$ symmetry. Inpractical settings, however, the partitioning into individually transformingregions is unknown a priori. Errors in the partition prediction wouldunavoidably map to errors in respecting the true input symmetry. Past workshave proposed different ways to predict the partition, which may exhibituncontrolled errors in their ability to maintain equivariance to the actualpartition. To this end, we introduce APEN: a general framework for constructingapproximate piecewise-$E(3)$ equivariant point networks. Our primary insight isthat functions that are equivariant with respect to a finer partition will alsomaintain equivariance in relation to the true partition. Leveraging thisobservation, we propose a design where the equivariance approximation error ateach layers can be bounded solely in terms of (i) uncertainty quantification ofthe partition prediction, and (ii) bounds on the probability of failing tosuggest a proper subpartition of the ground truth one. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of APEN using two data types exemplifying part-based symmetry:(i) real-world scans of room scenes containing multiple furniture-type objects;and, (ii) human motions, characterized by articulated parts exhibiting rigidmovement. Our empirical results demonstrate the advantage of integratingpiecewise $E(3)$ symmetry into network design, showing a distinct improvementin generalization compared to prior works for both classification andsegmentation tasks.</description><author>Matan Atzmon, Jiahui Huang, Francis Williams, Or Litany</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 15:34:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08529v1</guid></item><item><title>GS-CLIP: Gaussian Splatting for Contrastive Language-Image-3D Pretraining from Real-World Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06198v2</link><description>3D Shape represented as point cloud has achieve advancements in multimodalpre-training to align image and language descriptions, which is curial toobject identification, classification, and retrieval.

However, existing IL scenarios and datasetsare unqualified for assessing forgetting in PLMs, giving an illusion that PLMsdo not suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we propose achallenging IL scenario called instance-incremental learning (IIL) and a noveldataset called Concept-1K, which supports an order of magnitude larger ILsteps. Based on the experiments on Concept-1K, we reveal that billion-parameterPLMs still suffer from catastrophic forgetting, and the forgetting is affectedby both model scale, pretraining, and buffer size. Furthermore, existing ILmethods and a popular finetuning technique, LoRA, fail to achieve satisfactoryperformance. Our study provides a novel scenario for future studies to explorethe catastrophic forgetting of PLMs and encourage more powerful techniques tobe designed for alleviating the forgetting in PLMs. The data, code and scriptsare publicly available athttps://github.com/zzz47zzz/pretrained-lm-for-incremental-learning.</description><author>Junhao Zheng, Shengjie Qiu, Qianli Ma</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 15:29:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08526v1</guid></item></channel></rss>

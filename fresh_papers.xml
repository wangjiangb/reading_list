However, existing methods struggle with either computationalcomplexity or model expressivity, rendering the maximum sequence lengthrestricted. In this work, we introduce LongNet, a Transformer variant that canscale sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens, without sacrificing theperformance on shorter sequences. Specifically, we propose dilated attention,which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. LongNethas significant advantages: 1) it has a linear computation complexity and alogarithm dependency between tokens; 2) it can be served as a distributedtrainer for extremely long sequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-inreplacement for standard attention, which can be seamlessly integrated with theexisting Transformer-based optimization. Experiments results demonstrate thatLongNet yields strong performance on both long-sequence modeling and generallanguage tasks. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling very longsequences, e.g., treating a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as asequence.</description><author>Jiayu Ding, Shuming Ma, Li Dong, Xingxing Zhang, Shaohan Huang, Wenhui Wang, Furu Wei</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 18:59:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02486v1</guid></item><item><title>Compositionality as Lexical Symmetry</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12926v2</link><description>In tasks like semantic parsing, instruction following, and questionanswering, standard deep networks fail to generalize compositionally from smalldatasets. Many existing approaches overcome this limitation with modelarchitectures that enforce a compositional process of sentence interpretation.In this paper, we present a domain-general and model-agnostic formulation ofcompositionality as a constraint on symmetries of data distributions ratherthan models. Informally, we prove that whenever a task can be solved by acompositional model, there is a corresponding data augmentation scheme -- aprocedure for transforming examples into other well formed examples -- thatimparts compositional inductive bias on any model trained to solve the sametask. We describe a procedure called LEXSYM that discovers thesetransformations automatically, then applies them to training data for ordinaryneural sequence models. Unlike existing compositional data augmentationprocedures, LEXSYM can be deployed agnostically across text, structured data,and even images. It matches or surpasses state-of-the-art, task-specific modelson COGS semantic parsing, SCAN and ALCHEMY instruction following, andCLEVR-COGENT visual question answering datasets.</description><author>Ekin Aky√ºrek, Jacob Andreas</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 18:59:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12926v2</guid></item><item><title>Building Cooperative Embodied Agents Modularly with Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02485v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive planning abilitiesin single-agent embodied tasks across various domains. However, their capacityfor planning and communication in multi-agent cooperation remains unclear, eventhough these are crucial skills for intelligent embodied agents. In this paper,we present a novel framework that utilizes LLMs for multi-agent cooperation andtests it in various embodied environments. Our framework enables embodiedagents to plan, communicate, and cooperate with other embodied agents or humansto accomplish long-horizon tasks efficiently. We demonstrate that recent LLMs,such as GPT-4, can surpass strong planning-based methods and exhibit emergenteffective communication using our framework without requiring fine-tuning orfew-shot prompting. We also discover that LLM-based agents that communicate innatural language can earn more trust and cooperate more effectively withhumans. Our research underscores the potential of LLMs for embodied AI and laysthe foundation for future research in multi-agent cooperation.

The proposed EDT differentiates itself byfacilitating trajectory stitching during action inference at test time,achieved by adjusting the history length maintained in DT. Further, the EDToptimizes the trajectory by retaining a longer history when the previoustrajectory is optimal and a shorter one when it is sub-optimal, enabling it to"stitch" with a more optimal trajectory. Extensive experimentation demonstratesEDT's ability to bridge the performance gap between DT-based and QLearning-based approaches. In particular, the EDT outperforms Q Learning-basedmethods in a multi-task regime on the D4RL locomotion benchmark and Atarigames.

Going beyondrecognition of the issue, we investigate why such attacks succeed and how theycan be created. We hypothesize two failure modes of safety training: competingobjectives and mismatched generalization. Competing objectives arise when amodel's capabilities and safety goals conflict, while mismatched generalizationoccurs when safety training fails to generalize to a domain for whichcapabilities exist. We use these failure modes to guide jailbreak design andthen evaluate state-of-the-art models, including OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic'sClaude v1.3, against both existing and newly designed attacks. We find thatvulnerabilities persist despite the extensive red-teaming and safety-trainingefforts behind these models. Notably, new attacks utilizing our failure modessucceed on every prompt in a collection of unsafe requests from the models'red-teaming evaluation sets and outperform existing ad hoc jailbreaks. Ouranalysis emphasizes the need for safety-capability parity -- that safetymechanisms should be as sophisticated as the underlying model -- and arguesagainst the idea that scaling alone can resolve these safety failure modes.</description><author>Alexander Wei, Nika Haghtalab, Jacob Steinhardt</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 18:58:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02483v1</guid></item><item><title>A Dataset of Inertial Measurement Units for Handwritten English Alphabets</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02480v1</link><description>This paper presents an end-to-end methodology for collecting datasets torecognize handwritten English alphabets by utilizing Inertial Measurement Units(IMUs) and leveraging the diversity present in the Indian writing style. TheIMUs are utilized to capture the dynamic movement patterns associated withhandwriting, enabling more accurate recognition of alphabets. The Indiancontext introduces various challenges due to the heterogeneity in writingstyles across different regions and languages. By leveraging this diversity,the collected dataset and the collection system aim to achieve higherrecognition accuracy. Some preliminary experimental results demonstrate theeffectiveness of the dataset in accurately recognizing handwritten Englishalphabet in the Indian context.

We study theproblem of self-training edge detection, leveraging the untapped wealth oflarge-scale unlabeled image datasets. We design a self-supervised frameworkwith multi-layer regularization and self-teaching. In particular, we impose aconsistency regularization which enforces the outputs from each of the multiplelayers to be consistent for the input image and its perturbed counterpart. Weadopt L0-smoothing as the 'perturbation' to encourage edge prediction lying onsalient boundaries following the cluster assumption in self-supervisedlearning. Meanwhile, the network is trained with multi-layer supervision bypseudo labels which are initialized with Canny edges and then iterativelyrefined by the network as the training proceeds. The regularization andself-teaching together attain a good balance of precision and recall, leadingto a significant performance boost over supervised methods, with lightweightrefinement on the target dataset. Furthermore, our method demonstrates strongcross-dataset generality. For example, it attains 4.8% improvement for ODS and5.8% for OIS when tested on the unseen BIPED dataset, compared to thestate-of-the-art methods.</description><author>Yunfan Ye, Renjiao Yi, Zhiping Cai, Kai Xu</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 18:52:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05121v2</guid></item><item><title>Linear Regression on Manifold Structured Data: the Impact of Extrinsic Geometry on Solutions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02478v1</link><description>In this paper, we study linear regression applied to data structured on amanifold. We assume that the data manifold is smooth and is embedded in aEuclidean space, and our objective is to reveal the impact of the datamanifold's extrinsic geometry on the regression. Specifically, we analyze theimpact of the manifold's curvatures (or higher order nonlinearity in theparameterization when the curvatures are locally zero) on the uniqueness of theregression solution. Our findings suggest that the corresponding linearregression does not have a unique solution when the embedded submanifold isflat in some dimensions. Otherwise, the manifold's curvature (or higher ordernonlinearity in the embedding) may contribute significantly, particularly inthe solution associated with the normal directions of the manifold. Ourfindings thus reveal the role of data manifold geometry in ensuring thestability of regression models for out-of-distribution inferences.</description><author>Liangchen Liu, Juncai He, Richard Tsai</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 18:51:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02478v1</guid></item><item><title>Reasoning or Reciting? Exploring the Capabilities and Limitations of Language Models Through Counterfactual Tasks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02477v1</link><description>The impressive performance of recent language models across a wide range oftasks suggests that they possess a degree of abstract reasoning skills. Arethese skills general and transferable, or specialized to specific tasks seenduring pretraining? To disentangle these effects, we propose an evaluationframework based on "counterfactual" task variants that deviate from the defaultassumptions underlying standard tasks. Across a suite of 11 tasks, we observenontrivial performance on the counterfactual variants, but nevertheless findthat performance substantially and consistently degrades compared to thedefault conditions. This suggests that while current LMs may possess abstracttask-solving skills to a degree, they often also rely on narrow,non-transferable procedures for task-solving. These results motivate a morecareful interpretation of language model performance that teases apart theseaspects of behavior.</description><author>Zhaofeng Wu, Linlu Qiu, Alexis Ross, Ekin Aky√ºrek, Boyuan Chen, Bailin Wang, Najoung Kim, Jacob Andreas, Yoon Kim</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 18:50:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02477v1</guid></item><item><title>Natural Language Deduction with Incomplete Information</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02472v1</link><description>A growing body of work studies how to answer a question or verify a claim bygenerating a natural language "proof": a chain of deductive inferences yieldingthe answer based on a set of premises. However, these methods can only makesound deductions when they follow from evidence that is given. We propose a newsystem that can handle the underspecified setting where not all premises arestated at the outset; that is, additional assumptions need to be materializedto prove a claim. By using a natural language generation model to abductivelyinfer a premise given another premise and a conclusion, we can impute missingpieces of evidence needed for the conclusion to be true. Our system searchesover two fringes in a bidirectional fashion, interleaving deductive(forward-chaining) and abductive (backward-chaining) generation steps.

However, the performance of these models heavilyrelies on design choices such as network structures, training data, andtraining strategies, and these choices have not been extensively discussed inthe literature, making it difficult to quantify progress in this field. Toaddress this issue, this paper presents a systematic and comprehensive study,quantitatively and qualitatively, on training such models. We implement over 20variants with controlled settings. Concretely, for network structures, wecompare different LLM backbones and model designs. For training data, weinvestigate the impact of data and sampling strategies. For instructions, weexplore the influence of diversified prompts on the instruction-followingability of the trained models. For benchmarks, we contribute the first, to ourbest knowledge, comprehensive evaluation set including both image and videotasks through crowd-sourcing. Based on our findings, we present Lynx, whichperforms the most accurate multi-modal understanding while keeping the bestmulti-modal generation ability compared to existing open-sourced GPT4-stylemodels.</description><author>Yan Zeng, Hanbo Zhang, Jiani Zheng, Jiangnan Xia, Guoqiang Wei, Yang Wei, Yuchen Zhang, Tao Kong</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 18:44:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02469v1</guid></item><item><title>Large-scale Detection of Marine Debris in Coastal Areas with Sentinel-2</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02465v1</link><description>Detecting and quantifying marine pollution and macro-plastics is anincreasingly pressing ecological issue that directly impacts ecology and humanhealth. Efforts to quantify marine pollution are often conducted with sparseand expensive beach surveys, which are difficult to conduct on a large scale.Here, remote sensing can provide reliable estimates of plastic pollution byregularly monitoring and detecting marine debris in coastal areas.Medium-resolution satellite data of coastal areas is readily available and canbe leveraged to detect aggregations of marine debris containing plastic litter.In this work, we present a detector for marine debris built on a deepsegmentation model that outputs a probability for marine debris at the pixellevel. We train this detector with a combination of annotated datasets ofmarine debris and evaluate it on specifically selected test sites where it ishighly probable that plastic pollution is present in the detected marinedebris. We demonstrate quantitatively and qualitatively that a deep learningmodel trained on this dataset issued from multiple sources outperforms existingdetection models trained on previous datasets by a large margin. Ourexperiments show, consistent with the principles of data-centric AI, that thisperformance is due to our particular dataset design with extensive sampling ofnegative examples and label refinements rather than depending on the particulardeep learning model.

However, accurately reconstructing the complex morphology of axons andmyelin sheaths poses a significant challenge. Furthermore, the absence ofpublicly available, large-scale EM datasets encompassing complete crosssections of the corpus callosum, with dense ground truth segmentation for axonsand myelin sheaths, hinders the advancement and evaluation of holistic corpuscallosum reconstructions. To surmount these obstacles, we introduce theAxonCallosumEM dataset, comprising a 1.83 times 5.76mm EM image captured fromthe corpus callosum of the Rett Syndrome (RTT) mouse model, which entailextensive axon bundles. We meticulously proofread over 600,000 patches at aresolution of 1024 times 1024, thus providing a comprehensive ground truth formyelinated axons and myelin sheaths. Additionally, we extensively annotatedthree distinct regions within the dataset for the purposes of training,testing, and validation. Utilizing this dataset, we develop a fine-tuningmethodology that adapts Segment Anything Model (SAM) to EM images segmentationtasks, called EM-SAM, enabling outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.Furthermore, we present the evaluation results of EM-SAM as a baseline.</description><author>Ao Cheng, Guoqiang Zhao, Lirong Wang, Ruobing Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 18:38:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02464v1</guid></item><item><title>Expert-Agnostic Ultrasound Image Quality Assessment using Deep Variational Clustering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02462v1</link><description>Ultrasound imaging is a commonly used modality for several diagnostic andtherapeutic procedures. However, the diagnosis by ultrasound relies heavily onthe quality of images assessed manually by sonographers, which diminishes theobjectivity of the diagnosis and makes it operator-dependent. The supervisedlearning-based methods for automated quality assessment require manuallyannotated datasets, which are highly labour-intensive to acquire. Theseultrasound images are low in quality and suffer from noisy annotations causedby inter-observer perceptual variations, which hampers learning efficiency. Wepropose an UnSupervised UltraSound image Quality assessment Network, US2QNet,that eliminates the burden and uncertainty of manual annotations. US2QNet usesthe variational autoencoder embedded with the three modules, pre-processing,clustering and post-processing, to jointly enhance, extract, cluster andvisualize the quality feature representation of ultrasound images. Thepre-processing module uses filtering of images to point the network's attentiontowards salient quality features, rather than getting distracted by noise.Post-processing is proposed for visualizing the clusters of featurerepresentations in 2D space. We validated the proposed framework for qualityassessment of the urinary bladder ultrasound images. The proposed frameworkachieved 78% accuracy and superior performance to state-of-the-art clusteringmethods.</description><author>Deepak Raina, Dimitrios Ntentia, SH Chandrashekhara, Richard Voyles, Subir Kumar Saha</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 18:34:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02462v1</guid></item><item><title>Performance Scaling via Optimal Transport: Enabling Data Selection from Partially Revealed Sources</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02460v1</link><description>Traditionally, data selection has been studied in settings where all samplesfrom prospective sources are fully revealed to a machine learning developer.However, in practical data exchange scenarios, data providers often reveal onlya limited subset of samples before an acquisition decision is made. Recently,there have been efforts to fit scaling laws that predict model performance atany size and data source composition using the limited available samples.However, these scaling functions are black-box, computationally expensive tofit, highly susceptible to overfitting, or/and difficult to optimize for dataselection. This paper proposes a framework called &lt;projektor&gt;, which predictsmodel performance and supports data selection decisions based on partialsamples of prospective data sources. Our approach distinguishes itself fromexisting work by introducing a novel *two-stage* performance inference process.In the first stage, we leverage the Optimal Transport distance to predict themodel's performance for any data mixture ratio within the range of discloseddata sizes. In the second stage, we extrapolate the performance to largerundisclosed data sizes based on a novel parameter-free mapping techniqueinspired by neural scaling laws. We further derive an efficient gradient-basedmethod to select data sources based on the projected model performance.Evaluation over a diverse range of applications demonstrates that &lt;projektor&gt;significantly improves existing performance scaling approaches in terms of boththe accuracy of performance inference and the computation costs associated withconstructing the performance predictor. Also, &lt;projektor&gt; outperforms by a widemargin in data selection effectiveness compared to a range of otheroff-the-shelf solutions.</description><author>Feiyang Kang, Hoang Anh Just, Anit Kumar Sahu, Ruoxi Jia</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 18:33:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02460v1</guid></item><item><title>Gaussian Database Alignment and Gaussian Planted Matching</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02459v1</link><description>Database alignment is a variant of the graph alignment problem: Given a pairof anonymized databases containing separate yet correlated features for a setof users, the problem is to identify the correspondence between the featuresand align the anonymized user sets based on correlation alone. This closelyrelates to planted matching, where given a bigraph with random weights, thegoal is to identify the underlying matching that generated the given weights.We study an instance of the database alignment problem with multivariateGaussian features and derive results that apply both for database alignment andfor planted matching, demonstrating the connection between them. Theperformance thresholds for database alignment converge to that for plantedmatching when the dimensionality of the database features is \(\omega(\logn)\), where \(n\) is the size of the alignment, and no individual feature istoo strong. The maximum likelihood algorithms for both planted matching anddatabase alignment take the form of a linear program and we study relaxationsto better understand the significance of various constraints under variousconditions and present achievability and converse bounds. Our results show thatthe almost-exact alignment threshold for the relaxed algorithms coincide withthat of maximum likelihood, while there is a gap between the exact alignmentthresholds. Our analysis and results extend to the unbalanced case where oneuser set is not fully covered by the alignment.</description><author>Osman Emre Dai, Daniel Cullina, Negar Kiyavash</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 18:32:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02459v1</guid></item><item><title>DeSRA: Detect and Delete the Artifacts of GAN-based Real-World Super-Resolution Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02457v1</link><description>Image super-resolution (SR) with generative adversarial networks (GAN) hasachieved great success in restoring realistic details. However, it is notoriousthat GAN-based SR models will inevitably produce unpleasant and undesirableartifacts, especially in practical scenarios. Previous works typically suppressartifacts with an extra loss penalty in the training phase. They only work forin-distribution artifact types generated during training. When applied inreal-world scenarios, we observe that those improved methods still generateobviously annoying artifacts during inference. In this paper, we analyze thecause and characteristics of the GAN artifacts produced in unseen test datawithout ground-truths. We then develop a novel method, namely, DeSRA, to Detectand then Delete those SR Artifacts in practice. Specifically, we propose tomeasure a relative local variance distance from MSE-SR results and GAN-SRresults, and locate the problematic areas based on the above distance andsemantic-aware thresholds. After detecting the artifact regions, we develop afinetune procedure to improve GAN-based SR models with a few samples, so thatthey can deal with similar types of artifacts in more unseen real data.Equipped with our DeSRA, we can successfully eliminate artifacts from inferenceand improve the ability of SR models to be applied in real-world scenarios.

Despite being a key technology behind autonomous cars, imageprocessing, speech recognition, etc., a notorious problem remains the lack oftheoretical understanding of DL and related interpretability and (adversarial)robustness issues. Understanding the specifics of DL, as compared to, say,other forms of nonlinear regression methods or statistical learning, isinteresting from a mathematical perspective, but at the same time it is ofcrucial importance in practice: treating neural networks as mere black boxesmight be sufficient in certain cases, but many applications require waterproofperformance guarantees and a deeper understanding of what could go wrong andwhy it could go wrong. It is probably fair to say that, despite beingmathematically well founded as a method to approximate complicated functions,DL is mostly still more like modern alchemy that is firmly in the hands ofengineers and computer scientists. Nevertheless, it is evident that certainspecifics of DL that could explain its success in applications demandssystematic mathematical approaches. In this work, we review robustness issuesof DL and particularly bridge concerns and attempts from approximation theoryto statistical learning theory.

Instruction tuning is a technique for training LLMsto follow instructions. We advocate combining these two approaches, as we findthat MoE models benefit more from instruction tuning than dense models. Inparticular, we conduct empirical studies across three experimental setups: (i)Direct finetuning on individual downstream tasks devoid of instruction tuning;(ii) Instructiontuning followed by in-context few-shot or zero-shotgeneralization on downstream tasks; and (iii) Instruction tuning supplementedby further finetuning on individual downstream tasks. In the first scenario,MoE models overall underperform dense models of identical computationalcapacity. This narrative, however, dramatically changes with the introductionof instruction tuning (second and third scenario), used independently or inconjunction with task-specific finetuning. Our most powerful model,FLAN-MOE-32B, surpasses the performance of FLAN-PALM-62B on four benchmarktasks, while using only a third of the FLOPs.

However, due to GI anatomicalconstraints and hardware manufacturing limitations, WCE vision signals maysuffer from insufficient illumination, leading to a complicated screening andexamination procedure.

Given the exuberantdevelopment of the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) in computervision, we introduce a WCE LLIE framework based on the multi-scaleconvolutional neural network (CNN) and reverse diffusion process. Themulti-scale design allows models to preserve high-resolution representation andcontext information from low-resolution, while the curved wavelet attention(CWA) block is proposed for high-frequency and local feature learning.Furthermore, we combine the reverse diffusion procedure to further optimize theshallow output and generate the most realistic image.

We perform a snowballing-based literature search to findpublications on language models for source code, and analyze their reusabilityfrom a sustainability standpoint. From 494 unique publications, we identified 293 relevant publications thatuse language models to address code-related tasks. Among them, 27% (79 out of293) make artifacts available for reuse. This can be in the form of tools orIDE plugins designed for specific tasks or task-agnostic models that can befine-tuned for a variety of downstream tasks. Moreover, we collect insights onthe hardware used for model training, as well as training time, which togetherdetermine the energy consumption of the development process. We find that thereare deficiencies in the sharing of information and artifacts for currentstudies on source code models for software engineering tasks, with 40% of thesurveyed papers not sharing source code or trained artifacts. We recommend thesharing of source code as well as trained artifacts, to enable sustainablereproducibility. Moreover, comprehensive information on training times andhardware configurations should be shared for transparency on a model's carbonfootprint.</description><author>Max Hort, Anastasiia Grishina, Leon Moonen</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 18:13:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02443v1</guid></item><item><title>Phase Unwrapping of Color Doppler Echocardiography using Deep Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13695v2</link><description>Color Doppler echocardiography is a widely used non-invasive imaging modalitythat provides real-time information about the intracardiac blood flow. In anapical long-axis view of the left ventricle, color Doppler is subject to phasewrapping, or aliasing, especially during cardiac filling and ejection. Whensetting up quantitative methods based on color Doppler, it is necessary tocorrect this wrapping artifact. We developed an unfolded primal-dual network tounwrap (dealias) color Doppler echocardiographic images and compared itseffectiveness against two state-of-the-art segmentation approaches based onnnU-Net and transformer models. We trained and evaluated the performance ofeach method on an in-house dataset and found that the nnU-Net-based methodprovided the best dealiased results, followed by the primal-dual approach andthe transformer-based technique. Noteworthy, the primal-dual network, which hadsignificantly fewer trainable parameters, performed competitively with respectto the other two methods, demonstrating the high potential of deep unfoldingmethods. Our results suggest that deep learning-based methods can effectivelyremove aliasing artifacts in color Doppler echocardiographic images,outperforming DeAN, a state-of-the-art semi-automatic technique. Overall, ourresults show that deep learning-based methods have the potential to effectivelypreprocess color Doppler images for downstream quantitative analysis.</description><author>Hang Jung Ling, Olivier Bernard, Nicolas Ducros, Damien Garcia</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 18:03:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13695v2</guid></item><item><title>Distilling Step-by-Step! Outperforming Larger Language Models with Less Training Data and Smaller Model Sizes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02301v2</link><description>Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging because they are memoryinefficient and compute-intensive for practical applications. In reaction,researchers train smaller task-specific models by either finetuning with humanlabels or distilling using LLM-generated labels. However, finetuning anddistillation require large amounts of training data to achieve comparableperformance to LLMs. We introduce Distilling step-by-step, a new mechanism that(a) trains smaller models that outperform LLMs, and (b) achieves so byleveraging less training data needed by finetuning or distillation. Our methodextracts LLM rationales as additional supervision for training small modelswithin a multi-task framework. We present three findings across 4 NLPbenchmarks: First, compared to both finetuning and distillation, our mechanismachieves better performance with much fewer labeled/unlabeled trainingexamples. Second, compared to few-shot prompted LLMs, we achieve betterperformance using substantially smaller model sizes. Third, we reduce both themodel size and the amount of data required to outperform LLMs; our finetuned770M T5 model outperforms the few-shot prompted 540B PaLM model using only 80%of available data on a benchmark, whereas standard finetuning the same T5 modelstruggles to match even by using 100% of the dataset.

However, libraries are upgraded or deprecated veryfrequently and re-training large-scale language models is computationallyexpensive. Therefore, Continual Learning (CL) is an important aspect thatremains underexplored in the code domain. In this paper, we introduce abenchmark called CodeTask-CL that covers a wide range of tasks, including codegeneration, translation, summarization, and refinement, with different inputand output programming languages. Next, on our CodeTask-CL benchmark, wecompare popular CL techniques from NLP and Vision domains. We find thateffective methods like Prompt Pooling (PP) suffer from catastrophic forgettingdue to the unstable training of the prompt selection mechanism caused by starkdistribution shifts in coding tasks. We address this issue with our proposedmethod, Prompt Pooling with Teacher Forcing (PP-TF), that stabilizes trainingby enforcing constraints on the prompt selection mechanism and leads to a21.54% improvement over Prompt Pooling. Along with the benchmark, we establisha training pipeline that can be used for CL on code models, which we believecan motivate further development of CL methods for code models.

Recently, Wortsman et al. (2020)proposed a CL method, SupSup, which uses a randomly initialized, fixed basenetwork (model) and finds a supermask for each new task that selectively keepsor removes each weight to produce a subnetwork. They prevent forgetting as thenetwork weights are not being updated. Although there is no forgetting, theperformance of SupSup is sub-optimal because fixed weights restrict itsrepresentational power. Furthermore, there is no accumulation or transfer ofknowledge inside the model when new tasks are learned. Hence, we proposeExSSNeT (Exclusive Supermask SubNEtwork Training), that performs exclusive andnon-overlapping subnetwork weight training. This avoids conflicting updates tothe shared weights by subsequent tasks to improve performance while stillpreventing forgetting. Furthermore, we propose a novel KNN-based KnowledgeTransfer (KKT) module that utilizes previously acquired knowledge to learn newtasks better and faster. We demonstrate that ExSSNeT outperforms strongprevious methods on both NLP and Vision domains while preventing forgetting.Moreover, ExSSNeT is particularly advantageous for sparse masks that activate2-10% of the model parameters, resulting in an average improvement of 8.3% overSupSup. Furthermore, ExSSNeT scales to a large number of tasks (100).

The proposedclosure consists of two parts. A parametric one, which utilizes previouslyproposed, neural-network-based tensor basis functions dependent on the rate ofstrain and rotation tensor invariants. This is complemented by latent, randomvariables which account for aleatoric model errors. A fully Bayesianformulation is proposed, combined with a sparsity-inducing prior in order toidentify regions in the problem domain where the parametric closure isinsufficient and where stochastic corrections to the Reynolds stress tensor areneeded. Training is performed using sparse, indirect data, such as meanvelocities and pressures, in contrast to the majority of alternatives thatrequire direct Reynolds stress data. For inference and learning, a StochasticVariational Inference scheme is employed, which is based on Monte Carloestimates of the pertinent objective in conjunction with the reparametrizationtrick. This necessitates derivatives of the output of the RANS solver, forwhich we developed an adjoint-based formulation. In this manner, the parametricsensitivities from the differentiable solver can be combined with the built-in,automatic differentiation capability of the neural network library in order toenable an end-to-end differentiable framework. We demonstrate the capability ofthe proposed model to produce accurate, probabilistic, predictive estimates forall flow quantities, even in regions where model errors are present, on aseparated flow in the backward-facing step benchmark problem.</description><author>Atul Agrawal, Phaedon-Stelios Koutsourelakis</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 17:53:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02432v1</guid></item><item><title>Base Layer Efficiency in Scalable Human-Machine Coding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02430v1</link><description>A basic premise in scalable human-machine coding is that the base layer isintended for automated machine analysis and is therefore more compressible thanthe same content would be for human viewing.

However, learning such astructured world model, which specifically captures entities and relationships,remains a challenging and underexplored problem. To address this, we proposeFOCUS, a model-based agent that learns an object-centric world model. Thanks toa novel exploration bonus that stems from the object-centric representation,FOCUS can be deployed on robotics manipulation tasks to explore objectinteractions more easily. Evaluating our approach on manipulation tasks acrossdifferent settings, we show that object-centric world models allow the agent tosolve tasks more efficiently and enable consistent exploration of robot-objectinteractions.

In this paper,we propose a novel image editing method, DragonDiffusion, enabling Drag-stylemanipulation on Diffusion models. Specifically, we construct classifierguidance based on the strong correspondence of intermediate features in thediffusion model. It can transform the editing signals into gradients viafeature correspondence loss to modify the intermediate representation of thediffusion model. Based on this guidance strategy, we also build a multi-scaleguidance to consider both semantic and geometric alignment. Moreover, across-branch self-attention is added to maintain the consistency between theoriginal image and the editing result. Our method, through an efficient design,achieves various editing modes for the generated or real images, such as objectmoving, object resizing, object appearance replacement, and content dragging.It is worth noting that all editing and content preservation signals come fromthe image itself, and the model does not require fine-tuning or additionalmodules.

However, the computationally intensive numerical solutionsrequired for high-resolution hydrodynamics have historically prevented theirimplementation in near-real-time flood forecasting. This study examines whetherseveral Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures are suitable for optimizinghydrodynamic flood models. Several pluvial flooding events were simulated in alow-relief high-resolution urban environment using a 2D HEC-RAS hydrodynamicmodel. These simulations were assembled into a training set for the DNNs, whichwere then used to forecast flooding depths and velocities. The DNNs' forecastswere compared to the hydrodynamic flood models, and showed good agreement, witha median RMSE of around 2 mm for cell flooding depths in the study area. TheDNNs also improved forecast computation time significantly, with the DNNsproviding forecasts between 34.2 and 72.4 times faster than conventionalhydrodynamic models. The study area showed little change between HEC-RAS' FullMomentum Equations and Diffusion Equations, however, important numericalstability considerations were discovered that impact equation selection and DNNarchitecture configuration. Overall, the results from this study show that DNNscan greatly optimize hydrodynamic flood modeling, and enable near-real-timehydrodynamic flood forecasting.</description><author>Francisco Haces-Garcia, Natalya Maslennikova, Craig L Glennie, Hanadi S Rifai, Vedhus Hoskere, Nima Ekhtari</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 17:41:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12052v2</guid></item><item><title>In-Context Learning for Attention Scheme: from Single Softmax Regression to Multiple Softmax Regression via a Tensor Trick</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02419v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have brought significant and transformativechanges in human society. These models have demonstrated remarkablecapabilities in natural language understanding and generation, leading tovarious advancements and impacts across several domains. We consider the in-context learning under two formulation for attentionrelated regression in this work. Given matrices $A_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \timesd}$, and $A_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$,the purpose is to solve some certain optimization problems: Normalized version$\min_{X} \| D(X)^{-1} \exp(A_1 X A_2^\top) - B \|_F^2$ and Rescaled version$\| \exp(A_1 X A_2^\top) - D(X) \cdot B \|_F^2$. Here $D(X) := \mathrm{diag}(\exp(A_1 X A_2^\top) {\bf 1}_n )$. Our regression problem shares similarities with previous studies onsoftmax-related regression. Prior research has extensively investigatedregression techniques related to softmax regression: Normalized version $\|\langle \exp(Ax) , {\bf 1}_n \rangle^{-1} \exp(Ax) - b \|_2^2$ and Resscaledversion $\| \exp(Ax) - \langle \exp(Ax), {\bf 1}_n \rangle b \|_2^2 $ In contrast to previous approaches, we adopt a vectorization technique toaddress the regression problem in matrix formulation. This approach expands thedimension from $d$ to $d^2$, resembling the formulation of the regressionproblem mentioned earlier.

This is essential to determine which predictions are to be pushedtowards which solutions, or to be discarded. Popular matching strategiesinclude matching to the closest ground truth box (mostly used in combinationwith anchors), or matching via the Hungarian algorithm (mostly used inanchor-free methods).

Cloud isnatural and common in remote sensing images, however, camouflaging cloud basedadversarial attack and defense for remote sensing images are not well studiedbefore. Furthermore, we design DefenseNet as a learn-able pre-processing to theadversarial cloudy images so as to preserve the performance of the deeplearning based remote sensing SOD model, without tuning the already deployeddeep SOD model. By considering both regular and generalized adversarialexamples, the proposed DefenseNet can defend the proposed Adversarial Cloud inwhite-box setting and other attack methods in black-box setting.

However, they tend to be easily deceived by tricky questions such as"How many eyes does the sun have?". Such frailties of PLMs often allude to thelack of knowledge within them. In this paper, we find that the PLMs alreadypossess the knowledge required to rebut such questions, and the key is how toactivate the knowledge. To systematize this observation, we investigate thePLMs' responses to one kind of tricky questions, i.e., the false premisesquestions (FPQs). We annotate a FalseQA dataset containing 2365 human-writtenFPQs, with the corresponding explanations for the false premises and therevised true premise questions. Using FalseQA, we discover that PLMs arecapable of discriminating FPQs by fine-tuning on moderate numbers (e.g., 256)of examples. PLMs also generate reasonable explanations for the false premise,which serve as rebuttals. Further replaying a few general questions duringtraining allows PLMs to excel on FPQs and general questions simultaneously. Ourwork suggests that once the rebuttal ability is stimulated, knowledge insidethe PLMs can be effectively utilized to handle FPQs, which incentivizes theresearch on PLM-based QA systems.</description><author>Shengding Hu, Yifan Luo, Huadong Wang, Xingyi Cheng, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 17:09:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02394v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning Models of Adversarial Agent Behavior under Partial Observability</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11168v2</link><description>The need for opponent modeling and tracking arises in several real-worldscenarios, such as professional sports, video game design, and drug-traffickinginterdiction.

Furthermore, synthetic generation pipelines have the potential togenerate an unlimited number of images. The combination of high photorealismand scale turn synthetic data into a promising candidate for improving variousmachine learning (ML) pipelines. Thus far, a large body of research in thisfield has focused on using synthetic images for training, by augmenting andenlarging training data. In contrast to using synthetic data for training, inthis work we explore whether synthetic data can be beneficial for modelselection. Considering the task of image classification, we demonstrate thatwhen data is scarce, synthetic data can be used to replace the held outvalidation set, thus allowing to train on a larger dataset. We also introduce anovel method to calibrate the synthetic error estimation to fit that of thereal domain. We show that such calibration significantly improves theusefulness of synthetic data for model selection.</description><author>Alon Shoshan, Nadav Bhonker, Igor Kviatkovsky, Matan Fintz, Gerard Medioni</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 16:59:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00717v2</guid></item><item><title>Multi-Task Learning with Summary Statistics</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02388v1</link><description>Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning paradigm forintegrating data from multiple sources, leveraging similarities between tasksto improve overall model performance.

To use such data-driven systems wisely we must understand how theyinteract with the world, including how they depend causally on data inputs. Inthis work we develop Causal Dependence Plots (CDPs) to visualize how onevariable--an outcome--depends on changes in another variable--apredictor--$\textit{along with any consequent causal changes in other predictorvariables}$. Crucially, CDPs differ from standard methods based on holdingother predictors constant or assuming they are independent. CDPs make use of anauxiliary causal model because causal conclusions require causal assumptions.With simulations and real data experiments, we show CDPs can be combined in amodular way with methods for causal learning or sensitivity analysis.

Both in online and offline RL,the primary focus of research on the Bellman error lies in the optimizationtechniques and performance improvement, rather than exploring the inherentstructural properties of the Bellman error, such as distributioncharacteristics. In this study, we analyze the distribution of the Bellmanapproximation error in both online and offline settings. We find that in theonline environment, the Bellman error follows a Logistic distribution, while inthe offline environment, the Bellman error follows a constrained Logisticdistribution, where the constrained distribution is dependent on the priorpolicy in the offline data set. Based on this finding, we have improved theMSELoss which is based on the assumption that the Bellman errors follow anormal distribution, and we utilized the Logistic maximum likelihood functionto construct $\rm LLoss$ as an alternative loss function. In addition, weobserved that the rewards in the offline data set should follow a specificdistribution, which would facilitate the achievement of offline objectives. Inour numerical experiments, we performed controlled variable corrections on theloss functions of two variants of Soft-Actor-Critic in both online and offlineenvironments. The results confirmed our hypothesis regarding the online andoffline settings, we also found that the variance of LLoss is smaller thanMSELoss.

If a suitable initial registration is available, conventionalmethods like ICP and its many variants can provide adequate solutions. Inabsence of a suitable initialization and in the presence of a high outlier rateor in the case of small overlap though the task of rigid registration stillpresents great challenges. The advent of deep learning in computer vision hasbrought new drive to research on this topic, since it provides the possibilityto learn expressive feature-representations and provide one-shot estimatesinstead of depending on time-consuming iterations of conventional robustmethods. Yet, the rotation and permutation invariant nature of point cloudsposes its own challenges to deep learning, resulting in loss of performance andlow generalization capability due to sensitivity to outliers andcharacteristics of 3D scans not present during network training. In this work,we present a novel fast and light-weight network architecture using theattention mechanism to augment point descriptors at inference time to optimallysuit the registration task of the specific point clouds it is presented with.Employing a fully-connected graph both within and between point clouds lets thenetwork reason about the importance and reliability of points for registration,making our approach robust to outliers, low overlap and unseen data.

To meet thepractical requirements of botanical research and intelligent plant management,we construct a large-scale dataset for Plant detection in theThree-River-Source region (PTRS). This dataset comprises 6965 high-resolutionimages of 2160*3840 pixels, captured by diverse sensors and platforms, andfeaturing objects of varying shapes and sizes. Subsequently, a team ofbotanical image interpretation experts annotated these images with 21 commonlyoccurring object categories. The fully annotated PTRS images contain 122, 300instances of plant leaves, each labeled by a horizontal rectangle. The PTRSpresents us with challenges such as dense occlusion, varying leaf resolutions,and high feature similarity among plants, prompting us to develop a novelobject detection network named PlantDet.

Optimizing for flatnesshas been proposed as early as 1994 by Hochreiter and Schmidthuber, and wasfollowed by more recent successful sharpness-aware optimization techniques.Their widespread adoption in practice, though, is dubious because of the lackof theoretically grounded connection between flatness and generalization, inparticular in light of the reparameterization curse - certainreparameterizations of a neural network change most flatness measures but donot change generalization. Recent theoretical work suggests that a particularrelative flatness measure can be connected to generalization and solves thereparameterization curse. In this paper, we derive a regularizer based on thisrelative flatness that is easy to compute, fast, efficient, and works witharbitrary loss functions. It requires computing the Hessian only of a singlelayer of the network, which makes it applicable to large neural networks, andwith it avoids an expensive mapping of the loss surface in the vicinity of themodel. In an extensive empirical evaluation we show that this relative flatnessaware minimization (FAM) improves generalization in a multitude of applicationsand models, both in finetuning and standard training.

In themedical scenario, to fully visualize the lesion, radiologists are accustomed tozooming the MR images at arbitrary scales rather than using a fixed scale, asused by most MRI SR methods. In addition, existing multi-contrast MRI SRmethods often require a fixed resolution for the reference image, which makesacquiring reference images difficult and imposes limitations on arbitrary scaleSR tasks. To address these issues, we proposed an implicit neuralrepresentations based dual-arbitrary multi-contrast MRI super-resolutionmethod, called Dual-ArbNet. First, we decouple the resolution of the target andreference images by a feature encoder, enabling the network to input target andreference images at arbitrary scales. Then, an implicit fusion decoder fusesthe multi-contrast features and uses an Implicit Decoding Function~(IDF) toobtain the final MRI SR results. Furthermore, we introduce a curriculumlearning strategy to train our network, which improves the generalization andperformance of our Dual-ArbNet. Extensive experiments in two public MRIdatasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approachesunder different scale factors and has great potential in clinical practice.</description><author>Jiamiao Zhang, Yichen Chi, Jun Lyu, Wenming Yang, Yapeng Tian</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 15:43:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02334v1</guid></item><item><title>Data-driven Predictive Latency for 5G: A Theoretical and Experimental Analysis Using Network Measurements</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02329v1</link><description>The advent of novel 5G services and applications with binding latencyrequirements and guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) hastened the need toincorporate autonomous and proactive decision-making in network managementprocedures.

However, processing uniform background areas of an image shouldnot necessitate as much compute as dense, cluttered areas. To address thisissue, we propose a dynamic mixed-scale tokenization scheme for ViT, MSViT. Ourmethod introduces a conditional gating mechanism that selects the optimal tokenscale for every image region, such that the number of tokens is dynamicallydetermined per input. The proposed gating module is lightweight, agnostic tothe choice of transformer backbone, and trained within a few epochs (e.g., 20epochs on ImageNet) with little training overhead. In addition, to enhance theconditional behavior of the gate during training, we introduce a novelgeneralization of the batch-shaping loss. We show that our gating module isable to learn meaningful semantics despite operating locally at the coarsepatch-level. We validate MSViT on the tasks of classification and segmentationwhere it leads to improved accuracy-complexity trade-off.</description><author>Jakob Drachmann Havtorn, Amelie Royer, Tijmen Blankevoort, Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 15:22:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02321v1</guid></item><item><title>Algorithms, Incentives, and Democracy</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02319v1</link><description>Classification algorithms are increasingly used in areas such as housing,credit, and law enforcement in order to make decisions affecting peoples'lives. These algorithms can change individual behavior deliberately (a fraudprediction algorithm deterring fraud) or inadvertently (content sortingalgorithms spreading misinformation), and they are increasingly facing publicscrutiny and regulation. Some of these regulations, like the elimination ofcash bail in some states, have focused on \textit{lowering the stakes ofcertain classifications}. In this paper we characterize how optimalclassification by an algorithm designer can affect the distribution of behaviorin a population -- sometimes in surprising ways. We then look at the effect ofdemocratizing the rewards and punishments, or stakes, to algorithmicclassification to consider how a society can potentially stem (or facilitate!)predatory classification.

While in simple cases, suchas in bandits, passive and active data collection are similarly effective, theprice of passive sampling can be much higher when collecting data from a systemwith controlled states. The main focus of the current paper is thecharacterization of this price. For example, when learning in episodic finitestate-action Markov decision processes (MDPs) with $\mathrm{S}$ states and$\mathrm{A}$ actions, we show that even with the best (but passively chosen)logging policy, $\Omega(\mathrm{A}^{\min(\mathrm{S}-1, H)}/\varepsilon^2)$episodes are necessary (and sufficient) to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal policy,where $H$ is the length of episodes. Note that this shows that the samplecomplexity blows up exponentially compared to the case of active datacollection, a result which is not unexpected, but, as far as we know, have notbeen published beforehand and perhaps the form of the exact expression is alittle surprising. We also extend these results in various directions, such asother criteria or learning in the presence of function approximation, withsimilar conclusions. A remarkable feature of our result is the sharpcharacterization of the exponent that appears, which is critical forunderstanding what makes passive learning hard.</description><author>Chenjun Xiao, Ilbin Lee, Bo Dai, Dale Schuurmans, Csaba Szepesvari</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 15:19:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09973v3</guid></item><item><title>Utilizing ChatGPT Generated Data to Retrieve Depression Symptoms from Social Media</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02313v1</link><description>In this work, we present the contribution of the BLUE team in the eRisk Labtask on searching for symptoms of depression.

Despite the recent advances in multiple instance learning (MIL) forWSI classification, accurate classification of WSIs remains challenging due tothe extreme imbalance between the positive and negative instances in bags, andthe complicated pre-processing to fuse multi-scale information of WSI. To thisend, we propose a novel multi-scale prototypical Transformer (MSPT) for WSIclassification, which includes a prototypical Transformer (PT) module and amulti-scale feature fusion module (MFFM). The PT is developed to reduceredundant instances in bags by integrating prototypical learning into theTransformer architecture. It substitutes all instances with cluster prototypes,which are then re-calibrated through the self-attention mechanism of theTrans-former. Thereafter, an MFFM is proposed to fuse the clustered prototypesof different scales, which employs MLP-Mixer to enhance the informationcommunication between prototypes. The experimental results on two public WSIdatasets demonstrate that the proposed MSPT outperforms all the comparedalgorithms, suggesting its potential applications.</description><author>Saisai Ding, Jun Wang, Juncheng Li, Jun Shi</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 15:10:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02308v1</guid></item><item><title>The Potential of Visual ChatGPT For Remote Sensing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13009v2</link><description>Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly inLarge Language Models (LLMs), associated with deep learning-based computervision techniques, have shown substantial potential for automating a variety oftasks.

Every comparison frameworkis confronted with (at least) three fundamental challenges: the multiplicity ofquality criteria, the multiplicity of data sets and the randomness of theselection of data sets. In this paper, we add a fresh view to the vivid debateby adopting recent developments in decision theory. Based on so-calledpreference systems, our framework ranks classifiers by a generalized concept ofstochastic dominance, which powerfully circumvents the cumbersome, and ofteneven self-contradictory, reliance on aggregates. Moreover, we show thatgeneralized stochastic dominance can be operationalized by solvingeasy-to-handle linear programs and moreover statistically tested employing anadapted two-sample observation-randomization test. This yields indeed apowerful framework for the statistical comparison of classifiers over multipledata sets with respect to multiple quality criteria simultaneously.

Whenmaking personalized predictions, a model can combine two types of trends: (a)trends shared across people, i.e., person-generic trends, such as being happieron weekends, and (b) unique trends for each person, i.e., person-specifictrends, such as a stressful weekly meeting. Mixed effect models are popularstatistical models to study both trends by combining person-generic andperson-specific parameters. Though linear mixed effect models are gainingpopularity in machine learning by integrating them with neural networks, theseintegrations are currently limited to linear person-specific parameters: rulingout nonlinear person-specific trends. In this paper, we propose Neural MixedEffect (NME) models to optimize nonlinear person-specific parameters anywherein a neural network in a scalable manner. NME combines the efficiency of neuralnetwork optimization with nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Empirically, weobserve that NME improves performance across six unimodal and multimodaldatasets, including a smartphone dataset to predict daily mood and amother-adolescent dataset to predict affective state sequences where half themothers experience at least moderate symptoms of depression. Furthermore, weevaluate NME for two model architectures, including for neural conditionalrandom fields (CRF) to predict affective state sequences where the CRF learnsnonlinear person-specific temporal transitions between affective states.Analysis of these person-specific transitions on the mother-adolescent datasetshows interpretable trends related to the mother's depression symptoms.</description><author>Torsten W√∂rtwein, Nicholas Allen, Lisa B.

The latter comes with numerous practical challenges such as explosionof the computational cost in terms of the number of data samples and theoccurrence of instabilities during optimization. In this paper, we aim toovercome these issues by proposing a method which uses a truncated predictionloss and a subspace encoder for state estimation. The truncated prediction lossis computed by selecting multiple truncated subsections from the time seriesand computing the average prediction loss. To obtain a computationallyefficient estimation method that minimizes the truncated prediction loss, asubspace encoder represented by an artificial neural network is introduced.This encoder aims to approximate the state reconstructability map of theestimated model to provide an initial state for each truncated subsection givenpast inputs and outputs. By theoretical analysis, we show that, under mildconditions, the proposed method is locally consistent, increases optimizationstability, and achieves increased data efficiency by allowing for overlapbetween the subsections.

However, the current methods redirect the detection target of the objectdecoder, and the box target is not explicitly separated from the queryembeddings, which leads to long and hard training. Furthermore, matching thepredicted HOI instances with the ground-truth is more challenging than objectdetection, simply adapting training strategies from the object detection makesthe training more difficult. To clear the ambiguity between human and objectdetection and share the prediction burden, we propose a novel one-stageframework (SOV), which consists of a subject decoder, an object decoder, and averb decoder. Moreover, we propose a novel Specific Target Guided (STG)DeNoising strategy, which leverages learnable object and verb label embeddingsto guide the training and accelerates the training convergence.

However, it triggers a new dilemma as the widely used sparsequeries cannot guarantee a high recall, while dense queries inevitably bringmore similar queries and encounter optimization difficulties. As both sparseand dense queries are problematic, then what are the expected queries inend-to-end object detection? This paper shows that the solution should be DenseDistinct Queries (DDQ). Concretely, we first lay dense queries like traditionaldetectors and then select distinct ones for one-to-one assignments. DDQ blendsthe advantages of traditional and recent end-to-end detectors and significantlyimproves the performance of various detectors including FCN, R-CNN, and DETRs.Most impressively, DDQ-DETR achieves 52.1 AP on MS-COCO dataset within 12epochs using a ResNet-50 backbone, outperforming all existing detectors in thesame setting. DDQ also shares the benefit of end-to-end detectors in crowdedscenes and achieves 93.8 AP on CrowdHuman.

In this setting, we tackle the case of lowTikhonov regularization, resulting in potentially non-convex cost landscapes.While the global results obtained for high Tikhonov regularization may not holdglobally, we show that many of them can be recovered in regions where the lossfunction is locally convex. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop atraining method tailored to this specific type of Autoencoders with residualconnections, and we validate our approach through numerical experimentsconducted on various examples.</description><author>Cristina Cipriani, Massimo Fornasier, Alessandro Scagliotti</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 14:26:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02279v1</guid></item><item><title>AMIGO: Sparse Multi-Modal Graph Transformer with Shared-Context Processing for Representation Learning of Giga-pixel Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00865v2</link><description>Processing giga-pixel whole slide histopathology images (WSI) is acomputationally expensive task. Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become theconventional approach to process WSIs, in which these images are split intosmaller patches for further processing. However, MIL-based techniques ignoreexplicit information about the individual cells within a patch. In this paper,by defining the novel concept of shared-context processing, we designed amulti-modal Graph Transformer (AMIGO) that uses the celluar graph within thetissue to provide a single representation for a patient while taking advantageof the hierarchical structure of the tissue, enabling a dynamic focus betweencell-level and tissue-level information. We benchmarked the performance of ourmodel against multiple state-of-the-art methods in survival prediction andshowed that ours can significantly outperform all of them includinghierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT). More importantly, we show that our modelis strongly robust to missing information to an extent that it can achieve thesame performance with as low as 20% of the data. Finally, in two differentcancer datasets, we demonstrated that our model was able to stratify thepatients into low-risk and high-risk groups while other state-of-the-artmethods failed to achieve this goal. We also publish a large dataset ofimmunohistochemistry images (InUIT) containing 1,600 tissue microarray (TMA)cores from 188 patients along with their survival information, making it one ofthe largest publicly available datasets in this context.</description><author>Ramin Nakhli, Puria Azadi Moghadam, Haoyang Mi, Hossein Farahani, Alexander Baras, Blake Gilks, Ali Bashashati</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 14:25:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00865v2</guid></item><item><title>First-Explore, then Exploit: Meta-Learning Intelligent Exploration</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02276v1</link><description>Standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents never intelligently explore likea human (i.e. by taking into account complex domain priors and previousexplorations). Even the most basic intelligent exploration strategies such asexhaustive search are only inefficiently or poorly approximated by approachessuch as novelty search or intrinsic motivation, let alone more complicatedstrategies like learning new skills, climbing stairs, opening doors, orconducting experiments. This lack of intelligent exploration limits sampleefficiency and prevents solving hard exploration domains. We argue a corebarrier prohibiting many RL approaches from learning intelligent exploration isthat the methods attempt to explore and exploit simultaneously, which harmsboth exploration and exploitation as the goals often conflict. We propose anovel meta-RL framework (First-Explore) with two policies: one policy learns toonly explore and one policy learns to only exploit. Once trained, we can thenexplore with the explore policy, for as long as desired, and then exploit basedon all the information gained during exploration. This approach avoids theconflict of trying to do both exploration and exploitation at once. Wedemonstrate that First-Explore can learn intelligent exploration strategiessuch as exhaustive search and more, and that it outperforms dominant standardRL and meta-RL approaches on domains where exploration requires sacrificingreward. First-Explore is a significant step towards creating meta-RL algorithmscapable of learning human-level exploration which is essential to solvechallenging unseen hard-exploration domains.</description><author>Ben Norman, Jeff Clune</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 14:20:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02276v1</guid></item><item><title>Convolutions Through the Lens of Tensor Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02275v1</link><description>Despite their simple intuition, convolutions are more tedious to analyze thandense layers, which complicates the generalization of theoretical andalgorithmic ideas. We provide a new perspective onto convolutions throughtensor networks (TNs) which allow reasoning about the underlying tensormultiplications by drawing diagrams, and manipulating them to perform functiontransformations, sub-tensor access, and fusion. We demonstrate this expressivepower by deriving the diagrams of various autodiff operations and popularapproximations of second-order information with full hyper-parameter support,batching, channel groups, and generalization to arbitrary convolutiondimensions. Further, we provide convolution-specific transformations based onthe connectivity pattern which allow to re-wire and simplify diagrams beforeevaluation. Finally, we probe computational performance, relying on establishedmachinery for efficient TN contraction. Our TN implementation speeds up arecently-proposed KFAC variant up to 4.5x and enables new hardware-efficienttensor dropout for approximate backpropagation.</description><author>Felix Dangel</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 14:19:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02275v1</guid></item><item><title>Joint Hierarchical Priors and Adaptive Spatial Resolution for Efficient Neural Image Compression</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02273v1</link><description>Recently, the performance of neural image compression (NIC) has steadilyimproved thanks to the last line of study, reaching or outperformingstate-of-the-art conventional codecs. Despite significant progress, current NICmethods still rely on ConvNet-based entropy coding, limited in modelinglong-range dependencies due to their local connectivity and the increasingnumber of architectural biases and priors, resulting in complex underperformingmodels with high decoding latency. Motivated by the efficiency investigation ofthe Tranformer-based transform coding framework, namely SwinT-ChARM, we proposeto enhance the latter, as first, with a more straightforward yet effectiveTranformer-based channel-wise auto-regressive prior model, resulting in anabsolute image compression transformer (ICT). Through the proposed ICT, we cancapture both global and local contexts from the latent representations andbetter parameterize the distribution of the quantized latents. Further, weleverage a learnable scaling module with a sandwich ConvNeXt-basedpre-/post-processor to accurately extract more compact latent codes whilereconstructing higher-quality images. Extensive experimental results onbenchmark datasets showed that the proposed framework significantly improvesthe trade-off between coding efficiency and decoder complexity over theversatile video coding (VVC) reference encoder (VTM-18.0) and the neural codecSwinT-ChARM. Moreover, we provide model scaling studies to verify thecomputational efficiency of our approach and conduct several objective andsubjective analyses to bring to the fore the performance gap between theadaptive image compression transformer (AICT) and the neural codec SwinT-ChARM.</description><author>Ahmed Ghorbel, Wassim Hamidouche, Luce Morin</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 14:17:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02273v1</guid></item><item><title>SVDM: Single-View Diffusion Model for Pseudo-Stereo 3D Object Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02270v1</link><description>One of the key problems in 3D object detection is to reduce the accuracy gapbetween methods based on LiDAR sensors and those based on monocular cameras. Arecently proposed framework for monocular 3D detection based on Pseudo-Stereohas received considerable attention in the community. However, so far these twoproblems are discovered in existing practices, including (1) monocular depthestimation and Pseudo-Stereo detector must be trained separately, (2) Difficultto be compatible with different stereo detectors and (3) the overallcalculation is large, which affects the reasoning speed. In this work, wepropose an end-to-end, efficient pseudo-stereo 3D detection framework byintroducing a Single-View Diffusion Model (SVDM) that uses a few iterations togradually deliver right informative pixels to the left image. SVDM allows theentire pseudo-stereo 3D detection pipeline to be trained end-to-end and canbenefit from the training of stereo detectors. Afterwards, we further explorethe application of SVDM in depth-free stereo 3D detection, and the finalframework is compatible with most stereo detectors. Among multiple benchmarkson the KITTI dataset, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance.</description><author>Yuguang Shi</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 14:10:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02270v1</guid></item><item><title>Age Prediction Performance Varies Across Deep, Superficial, and Cerebellar White Matter Connections</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07398v2</link><description>The brain's white matter (WM) undergoes developmental and degenerativeprocesses during the human lifespan. To investigate the relationship between WManatomical regions and age, we study diffusion magnetic resonance imagingtractography that is finely parcellated into fiber clusters in the deep,superficial, and cerebellar WM. We propose a deep-learning-based age predictionmodel that leverages large convolutional kernels and inverted bottlenecks. Weimprove performance using novel discrete multi-faceted mix data augmentationand a novel prior-knowledge-based loss function that encourages age predictionsin the expected range. We study a dataset of 965 healthy young adults (22-37years) derived from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Experimental resultsdemonstrate that the proposed model achieves a mean absolute error of 2.59years and outperforms compared methods. We find that the deep WM is the mostinformative for age prediction in this cohort, while the superficial WM is theleast informative. Overall, the most predictive WM tracts are thethalamo-frontal tract from the deep WM and the intracerebellar input andPurkinje tract from the cerebellar WM.</description><author>Yuxiang Wei, Tengfei Xue, Yogesh Rathi, Nikos Makris, Fan Zhang, Lauren J.

We fill this gap by semi-automaticallycreating an NLI dataset for spatial reasoning, called SpaceNLI. The datasamples are automatically generated from a curated set of reasoning patterns,where the patterns are annotated with inference labels by experts. We testseveral SOTA NLI systems on SpaceNLI to gauge the complexity of the dataset andthe system's capacity for spatial reasoning. Moreover, we introduce a PatternAccuracy and argue that it is a more reliable and stricter measure than theaccuracy for evaluating a system's performance on pattern-based generated datasamples. Based on the evaluation results we find that the systems obtainmoderate results on the spatial NLI problems but lack consistency per inferencepattern. The results also reveal that non-projective spatial inferences(especially due to the "between" preposition) are the most challenging ones.</description><author>Lasha Abzianidze, Joost Zwarts, Yoad Winter</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 14:08:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02269v1</guid></item><item><title>Dynamical Isometry based Rigorous Fair Neural Architecture Search</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02263v1</link><description>Recently, the weight-sharing technique has significantly speeded up thetraining and evaluation procedure of neural architecture search. However, mostexisting weight-sharing strategies are solely based on experience orobservation, which makes the searching results lack interpretability andrationality. In addition, due to the negligence of fairness, current methodsare prone to make misjudgments in module evaluation. To address these problems,we propose a novel neural architecture search algorithm based on dynamicalisometry. We use the fix point analysis method in the mean field theory toanalyze the dynamics behavior in the steady state random neural network, andhow dynamic isometry guarantees the fairness of weight-sharing based NAS.Meanwhile, we prove that our module selection strategy is rigorous fair byestimating the generalization error of all modules with well-conditionedJacobian. Extensive experiments show that, with the same size, the architecturesearched by the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art top-1 validationaccuracy on ImageNet classification. In addition, we demonstrate that ourmethod is able to achieve better and more stable training performance withoutloss of generality.</description><author>Jianxiang Luo, Junyi Hu, Tianji Pang, Weihao Huang, Chuang Liu</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 14:01:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02263v1</guid></item><item><title>Analyzing Different Expert-Opined Strategies to Enhance the Effect on the Goal of a Multi-Attribute Decision-Making System Using a Concept of Effort Propagation and Application in Enhancement of High School Students' Performance</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02254v1</link><description>In many real-world multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems, miningthe inter-relationships and possible hierarchical structures among the factorsare considered to be one of the primary tasks. But, besides that, one majortask is to determine an optimal strategy to work on the factors to enhance theeffect on the goal attribute. This paper proposes two such strategies, namelyparallel and hierarchical effort assignment, and propagation strategies. Theconcept of effort propagation through a strategy is formally defined anddescribed in the paper. Both the parallel and hierarchical strategies aredivided into sub-strategies based on whether the assignment of efforts to thefactors is uniform or depends upon some appropriate heuristics related to thefactors in the system. The adapted and discussed heuristics are the relativesignificance and effort propagability of the factors. The strategies areanalyzed for a real-life case study regarding Indian high school administrativefactors that play an important role in enhancing students' performance. Totaleffort propagation of around 7%-15% to the goal is seen across the proposedstrategies given a total of 1 unit of effort to the directly accessible factorsof the system. A comparative analysis is adapted to determine the optimalstrategy among the proposed ones to enhance student performance mosteffectively. The highest effort propagation achieved in the work isapproximately 14.4348%. The analysis in the paper establishes the necessity ofresearch towards the direction of effort propagation analysis in case ofdecision-making problems.</description><author>Suvojit Dhara, Adrijit Goswami</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 13:53:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02254v1</guid></item><item><title>Multivariate Time Series Classification: A Deep Learning Approach</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02253v1</link><description>This paper investigates different methods and various neural networkarchitectures applicable in the time series classification domain.

However, with the increasing prominence offoundation models, pre-trained models equipped with informative representationshave become available for various downstream requirements. Several CL methodsbased on pre-trained models have been explored, either utilizing pre-extractedfeatures directly (which makes bridging distribution gaps challenging) orincorporating adaptors (which may be subject to forgetting). In this paper, wepropose a concise and effective approach for CL with pre-trained models. Giventhat forgetting occurs during parameter updating, we contemplate an alternativeapproach that exploits training-free random projectors and class-prototypeaccumulation, which thus bypasses the issue. Specifically, we inject a frozenRandom Projection layer with nonlinear activation between the pre-trainedmodel's feature representations and output head, which captures interactionsbetween features with expanded dimensionality, providing enhanced linearseparability for class-prototype-based CL. We also demonstrate the importanceof decorrelating the class-prototypes to reduce the distribution disparity whenusing pre-trained representations. These techniques prove to be effective andcircumvent the problem of forgetting for both class- and domain-incrementalcontinual learning. Compared to previous methods applied to pre-trainedViT-B/16 models, we reduce final error rates by between 10\% and 62\% on sevenclass-incremental benchmark datasets, despite not using any rehearsal memory.We conclude that the full potential of pre-trained models for simple,effective, and fast continual learning has not hitherto been fully tapped.</description><author>Mark D.

Existing methods eithertrain an instance classifier through pseudo-labeling or aggregate instancefeatures into a bag feature through attention mechanisms and then train a bagclassifier, where the attention scores can be used for instance-levelclassification. However, the pseudo instance labels constructed by the formerusually contain a lot of noise, and the attention scores constructed by thelatter are not accurate enough, both of which affect their performance. In thispaper, we propose an instance-level MIL framework based on contrastive learningand prototype learning to effectively accomplish both instance classificationand bag classification tasks. To this end, we propose an instance-level weaklysupervised contrastive learning algorithm for the first time under the MILsetting to effectively learn instance feature representation. We also proposean accurate pseudo label generation method through prototype learning. We thendevelop a joint training strategy for weakly supervised contrastive learning,prototype learning, and instance classifier training. Extensive experiments andvisualizations on four datasets demonstrate the powerful performance of ourmethod.

However, the requirement of theseparateness of clusters by low-density regions is not trivial since ahigh-density region might have different structures which should be clusteredinto different groups. Such a situation demonstrates the main flaw of allprevious density-based clustering algorithms we have known--structures in ahigh-density cluster could not be detected. Therefore, this paper aims toprovide a density-based clustering scheme that not only has the abilityprevious ones have but could also detect structures in a high-density regionnot separated by low-density ones. The algorithm employs secondary directeddifferential, hierarchy, normalized density, as well as the self-adaptioncoefficient, and thus is called Structure Detecting Cluster by HierarchicalSecondary Directed Differential with Normalized Density and Self-Adaption,dubbed by SDC-HSDD-NDSA for short. To illustrate its effectiveness, we run thealgorithm in several data sets. The results verify its validity in structuredetection, robustness over noises, as well as independence of granularities,and demonstrate that it could outperform previous ones.

FSCIL suffers from two major challenges: (i)over-fitting on the new classes due to limited amount of data, (ii)catastrophically forgetting about the old classes due to unavailability of datafrom these classes in the incremental stages. In this work, we propose aself-supervised stochastic classifier (S3C) to counter both these challenges inFSCIL. The stochasticity of the classifier weights (or class prototypes) notonly mitigates the adverse effect of absence of large number of samples of thenew classes, but also the absence of samples from previously learnt classesduring the incremental steps. This is complemented by the self-supervisioncomponent, which helps to learn features from the base classes which generalizewell to unseen classes that are encountered in future, thus reducingcatastrophic forgetting. Extensive evaluation on three benchmark datasets usingmultiple evaluation metrics show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.We also experiment on two additional realistic scenarios of FSCIL, namely wherethe number of annotated data available for each of the new classes can bedifferent, and also where the number of base classes is much lesser, and showthat the proposed S3C performs significantly better than the state-of-the-artfor all these challenging scenarios.</description><author>Jayateja Kalla, Soma Biswas</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 13:41:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02246v1</guid></item><item><title>Set Learning for Accurate and Calibrated Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02245v1</link><description>Model overconfidence and poor calibration are common in machine learning anddifficult to account for when applying standard empirical risk minimization. Inthis work, we propose a novel method to alleviate these problems that we callodd-$k$-out learning (OKO), which minimizes the cross-entropy error for setsrather than for single examples. This naturally allows the model to capturecorrelations across data examples and achieves both better accuracy andcalibration, especially in limited training data and class-imbalanced regimes.Perhaps surprisingly, OKO often yields better calibration even when trainingwith hard labels and dropping any additional calibration parameter tuning, suchas temperature scaling. We provide theoretical justification, establishing thatOKO naturally yields better calibration, and provide extensive experimentalanalyses that corroborate our theoretical findings. We emphasize that OKO is ageneral framework that can be easily adapted to many settings and the trainedmodel can be applied to single examples at inference time, without introducingsignificant run-time overhead or architecture changes.</description><author>Lukas Muttenthaler, Robert A.

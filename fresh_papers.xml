Early hair editingmethods use well-drawn sketches or masks to specify the editing conditions.Even though they can enable very fine-grained local control, such interactionmodes are inefficient for the editing conditions that can be easily specifiedby language descriptions or reference images. Thanks to the recent breakthroughof cross-modal models (e.g., CLIP), HairCLIP is the first work that enableshair editing based on text descriptions or reference images. However, suchtext-driven and reference-driven interaction modes make HairCLIP unable tosupport fine-grained controls specified by sketch or mask. In this paper, wepropose HairCLIPv2, aiming to support all the aforementioned interactions withone unified framework. Simultaneously, it improves upon HairCLIP with betterirrelevant attributes (e.g., identity, background) preservation and unseen textdescriptions support. The key idea is to convert all the hair editing tasksinto hair transfer tasks, with editing conditions converted into differentproxies accordingly. The editing effects are added upon the input image byblending the corresponding proxy features within the hairstyle or hair colorfeature spaces. Besides the unprecedented user interaction mode support,quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superiority ofHairCLIPv2 in terms of editing effects, irrelevant attribute preservation andvisual naturalness.

In this paper, we present anovel reflection tracing method tailored for the involved volume renderingwithin NeRF that takes these mirror-like objects into account while avoidingthe cost of straightforward but expensive extensions through standard pathtracing. By explicitly modeling the reflection behavior using physicallyplausible materials and estimating the reflected radiance with Monte-Carlomethods within the volume rendering formulation, we derive efficient strategiesfor importance sampling and the transmittance computation along rays from onlyfew samples. We show that our novel method enables the training of consistentrepresentations of such challenging scenes and achieves superior results incomparison to previous state-of-the-art approaches.</description><author>Leif Van Holland, Ruben Bliersbach, Jan U.

Thesecombinations yield different variational problems ($\textit{Lagrangians}$),encompassing many variations of the optimal transport problem such as theSchr\"odinger bridge, unbalanced optimal transport, and optimal transport withphysical constraints, among others. In general, the optimal density path isunknown, and solving these variational problems can be computationallychallenging. Leveraging the dual formulation of the Lagrangians, we propose anovel deep learning based framework approaching all of these problems from aunified perspective. Our method does not require simulating or backpropagatingthrough the trajectories of the learned dynamics, and does not need access tooptimal couplings. We showcase the versatility of the proposed framework byoutperforming previous approaches for the single-cell trajectory inference,where incorporating prior knowledge into the dynamics is crucial for correctpredictions.</description><author>Kirill Neklyudov, Rob Brekelmans, Alexander Tong, Lazar Atanackovic, Qiang Liu, Alireza Makhzani</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 18:59:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10649v1</guid></item><item><title>Step-by-Step Remediation of Students' Mathematical Mistakes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10648v1</link><description>Scaling high-quality tutoring is a major challenge in education. Because ofthe growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlikeprofessional educators, struggle to effectively address student mistakes andthus fail to seize prime learning opportunities for students. In this paper, weexplore the potential for large language models (LLMs) to assist math tutors inremediating student mistakes. We present ReMath, a benchmark co-developed withexperienced math teachers that deconstructs their thought process forremediation. The benchmark consists of three step-by-step tasks: (1) infer thetype of student error, (2) determine the strategy to address the error, and (3)generate a response that incorporates that information. We evaluate theperformance of state-of-the-art instruct-tuned and dialog models on ReMath. Ourfindings suggest that although models consistently improve upon original tutorresponses, we cannot rely on models alone to remediate mistakes. Providingmodels with the error type (e.g., the student is guessing) and strategy (e.g.,simplify the problem) leads to a 75% improvement in the response quality overmodels without that information. Nonetheless, despite the improvement, thequality of the best model's responses still falls short of experienced mathteachers. Our work sheds light on the potential and limitations of usingcurrent LLMs to provide high-quality learning experiences for both tutors andstudents at scale.

Due to their impressive generative capabilities, diffusionmodels are gradually superseding methods based on GANs and auto-regressiveTransformers, demonstrating exceptional performance not only in imagegeneration and editing, but also in the realm of video-related research.However, existing surveys mainly focus on diffusion models in the context ofimage generation, with few up-to-date reviews on their application in the videodomain. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review ofvideo diffusion models in the AIGC era. Specifically, we begin with a conciseintroduction to the fundamentals and evolution of diffusion models.Subsequently, we present an overview of research on diffusion models in thevideo domain, categorizing the work into three key areas: video generation,video editing, and other video understanding tasks. We conduct a thoroughreview of the literature in these three key areas, including furthercategorization and practical contributions in the field. Finally, we discussthe challenges faced by research in this domain and outline potential futuredevelopmental trends.

Recent large language model basedapproaches can allow for more open-ended planning but often require heavyprompt engineering or domain-specific pretrained models. To tackle this, wepropose a simple framework that achieves interactive task planning withlanguage models. Our system incorporates both high-level planning and low-levelfunction execution via language. We verify the robustness of our system ingenerating novel high-level instructions for unseen objectives and its ease ofadaptation to different tasks by merely substituting the task guidelines,without the need for additional complex prompt engineering. Furthermore, whenthe user sends a new request, our system is able to replan accordingly withprecision based on the new request, task guidelines and previously executedsteps.

While Zero-1-to-3 hasdemonstrated impressive zero-shot open-set NVS capability, it treats NVS as apure image-to-image translation problem. This approach suffers from thechallengingly under-constrained nature of single-view NVS: the process lacksmeans of explicit user control and often results in implausible NVSgenerations. To address this limitation, TOSS uses text as high-level semanticinformation to constrain the NVS solution space. TOSS fine-tunes text-to-imageStable Diffusion pre-trained on large-scale text-image pairs and introducesmodules specifically tailored to image and camera pose conditioning, as well asdedicated training for pose correctness and preservation of fine details.Comprehensive experiments are conducted with results showing that our proposedTOSS outperforms Zero-1-to-3 with more plausible, controllable andmultiview-consistent NVS results. We further support these results withcomprehensive ablations that underscore the effectiveness and potential of theintroduced semantic guidance and architecture design.</description><author>Yukai Shi, Jianan Wang, He Cao, Boshi Tang, Xianbiao Qi, Tianyu Yang, Yukun Huang, Shilong Liu, Lei Zhang, Heung-Yeung Shum</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 18:59:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10644v1</guid></item><item><title>Real-time Photorealistic Dynamic Scene Representation and Rendering with 4D Gaussian Splatting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10642v1</link><description>Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from 2D images and generating diverse viewsover time is challenging due to scene complexity and temporal dynamics. Despiteadvancements in neural implicit models, limitations persist: (i) InadequateScene Structure: Existing methods struggle to reveal the spatial and temporalstructure of dynamic scenes from directly learning the complex 6D plenopticfunction. (ii) Scaling Deformation Modeling: Explicitly modeling scene elementdeformation becomes impractical for complex dynamics. To address these issues,we consider the spacetime as an entirety and propose to approximate theunderlying spatio-temporal 4D volume of a dynamic scene by optimizing acollection of 4D primitives, with explicit geometry and appearance modeling.Learning to optimize the 4D primitives enables us to synthesize novel views atany desired time with our tailored rendering routine. Our model is conceptuallysimple, consisting of a 4D Gaussian parameterized by anisotropic ellipses thatcan rotate arbitrarily in space and time, as well as view-dependent andtime-evolved appearance represented by the coefficient of 4D spherindricalharmonics. This approach offers simplicity, flexibility for variable-lengthvideo and end-to-end training, and efficient real-time rendering, making itsuitable for capturing complex dynamic scene motions. Experiments acrossvarious benchmarks, including monocular and multi-view scenarios, demonstrateour 4DGS model's superior visual quality and efficiency.</description><author>Zeyu Yang, Hongye Yang, Zijie Pan, Xiatian Zhu, Li Zhang</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 18:57:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10642v1</guid></item><item><title>LLM Blueprint: Enabling Text-to-Image Generation with Complex and Detailed Prompts</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10640v1</link><description>Diffusion-based generative models have significantly advanced text-to-imagegeneration but encounter challenges when processing lengthy and intricate textprompts describing complex scenes with multiple objects. While excelling ingenerating images from short, single-object descriptions, these models oftenstruggle to faithfully capture all the nuanced details within longer and moreelaborate textual inputs. In response, we present a novel approach leveragingLarge Language Models (LLMs) to extract critical components from text prompts,including bounding box coordinates for foreground objects, detailed textualdescriptions for individual objects, and a succinct background context. Thesecomponents form the foundation of our layout-to-image generation model, whichoperates in two phases. The initial Global Scene Generation utilizes objectlayouts and background context to create an initial scene but often falls shortin faithfully representing object characteristics as specified in the prompts.To address this limitation, we introduce an Iterative Refinement Scheme thatiteratively evaluates and refines box-level content to align them with theirtextual descriptions, recomposing objects as needed to ensure consistency. Ourevaluation on complex prompts featuring multiple objects demonstrates asubstantial improvement in recall compared to baseline diffusion models. Thisis further validated by a user study, underscoring the efficacy of our approachin generating coherent and detailed scenes from intricate textual inputs.</description><author>Hanan Gani, Shariq Farooq Bhat, Muzammal Naseer, Salman Khan, Peter Wonka</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 18:57:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10640v1</guid></item><item><title>In-Context Pretraining: Language Modeling Beyond Document Boundaries</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10638v1</link><description>Large language models (LMs) are currently trained to predict tokens givendocument prefixes, enabling them to directly perform long-form generation andprompting-style tasks which can be reduced to document completion. Existingpretraining pipelines train LMs by concatenating random sets of short documentsto create input contexts but the prior documents provide no signal forpredicting the next document. We instead present In-Context Pretraining, a newapproach where language models are pretrained on a sequence of relateddocuments, thereby explicitly encouraging them to read and reason acrossdocument boundaries. We can do In-Context Pretraining by simply changing thedocument ordering so that each context contains related documents, and directlyapplying existing pretraining pipelines. However, this document sorting problemis challenging. There are billions of documents and we would like the sort tomaximize contextual similarity for every document without repeating any data.To do this, we introduce approximate algorithms for finding related documentswith efficient nearest neighbor search and constructing coherent input contextswith a graph traversal algorithm. Our experiments show In-Context Pretrainingoffers a simple and scalable approach to significantly enhance LMs'performance:we see notable improvements in tasks that require more complex contextualreasoning, including in-context learning (+8%), reading comprehension (+15%),faithfulness to previous contexts (+16%), long-context reasoning (+5%), andretrieval augmentation (+9%).</description><author>Weijia Shi, Sewon Min, Maria Lomeli, Chunting Zhou, Margaret Li, Victoria Lin, Noah A.

Although teachers espouse growth mindset principles, most find itdifficult to adopt GMSL in their practice due the lack of effective coaching inthis area. We explore whether large language models (LLMs) can provideautomated, personalized coaching to support teachers' use of GMSL. We establishan effective coaching tool to reframe unsupportive utterances to GMSL bydeveloping (i) a parallel dataset containing GMSL-trained teacher reframings ofunsupportive statements with an accompanying annotation guide, (ii) a GMSLprompt framework to revise teachers' unsupportive language, and (iii) anevaluation framework grounded in psychological theory for evaluating GMSL withthe help of students and teachers. We conduct a large-scale evaluationinvolving 174 teachers and 1,006 students, finding that both teachers andstudents perceive GMSL-trained teacher and model reframings as more effectivein fostering a growth mindset and promoting challenge-seeking behavior, amongother benefits. We also find that model-generated reframings outperform thosefrom the GMSL-trained teachers. These results show promise for harnessing LLMsto provide automated GMSL feedback for teachers and, more broadly, LLMs'potentiality for supporting students' learning in the classroom.

However, their performance in many-shot retrieval problemswhere training data is abundant, such as extreme multi-label classification(XMC), remains under-explored. Existing empirical evidence suggests that, forsuch problems, the dual-encoder method's accuracies lag behind the performanceof state-of-the-art (SOTA) extreme classification methods that grow the numberof learnable parameters linearly with the number of classes. As a result, somerecent extreme classification techniques use a combination of dual-encoders anda learnable classification head for each class to excel on these tasks. In thispaper, we investigate the potential of "pure" DE models in XMC tasks. Ourfindings reveal that when trained correctly standard dual-encoders can match oroutperform SOTA extreme classification methods by up to 2% at Precision@1 evenon the largest XMC datasets while being 20x smaller in terms of the number oftrainable parameters. We further propose a differentiable topk error-based lossfunction, which can be used to specifically optimize for Recall@k metrics.

A common approach is to conduct safety validation based on apredefined Operational Design Domain (ODD) describing specific conditions underwhich a system under test is required to operate properly. However, collectingsufficient realistic test cases to ensure comprehensive ODD coverage ischallenging. In this paper, we report our practical experiences regarding theutility of data simulation with deep generative models for scenario-based ODDvalidation. We consider the specific use case of a camera-based rail-scenesegmentation system designed to support autonomous train operation. Wedemonstrate the capabilities of semantically editing railway scenes with deepgenerative models to make a limited amount of test data more representative. Wealso show how our approach helps to analyze the degree to which a systemcomplies with typical ODD requirements. Specifically, we focus on evaluatingproper operation under different lighting and weather conditions as well aswhile transitioning between them.</description><author>Thomas Decker, Ananta R.

Moreover, evaluation ofthe accuracy of scientific protocols is challenging, because experiments can bedescribed correctly in many different ways, require expert knowledge toevaluate, and cannot usually be executed automatically. Here we present anautomatic evaluation framework for the task of planning experimental protocols,and we introduce BioProt: a dataset of biology protocols with correspondingpseudocode representations. To measure performance on generating scientificprotocols, we use an LLM to convert a natural language protocol intopseudocode, and then evaluate an LLM's ability to reconstruct the pseudocodefrom a high-level description and a list of admissible pseudocode functions. Weevaluate GPT-3 and GPT-4 on this task and explore their robustness. Weexternally validate the utility of pseudocode representations of text bygenerating accurate novel protocols using retrieved pseudocode, and we run agenerated protocol successfully in our biological laboratory.

Data contamination remains notoriouslychallenging to measure and mitigate, even with partial attempts like controlledexperimentation of training data, canary strings, or embedding similarities. Inthis work, we conduct the first thorough longitudinal analysis of datacontamination in LLMs by using the natural experiment of training cutoffs inGPT models to look at benchmarks released over time. Specifically, we considertwo code/mathematical problem-solving datasets, Codeforces and Project Euler,and find statistically significant trends among LLM pass rate vs. GitHubpopularity and release date that provide strong evidence of contamination.

Despite the significantprogress, the existing deep clustering works mostly utilize somedistribution-based clustering loss, lacking the ability to unify representationlearning and multi-scale structure learning. To address this, this paperpresents a new deep clustering approach termed image clustering withcontrastive learning and multi-scale graph convolutional networks (IcicleGCN),which bridges the gap between convolutional neural network (CNN) and graphconvolutional network (GCN) as well as the gap between contrastive learning andmulti-scale structure learning for the deep clustering task. Our frameworkconsists of four main modules, namely, the CNN-based backbone, the InstanceSimilarity Module (ISM), the Joint Cluster Structure Learning and Instancereconstruction Module (JC-SLIM), and the Multi-scale GCN module (M-GCN).Specifically, the backbone network with two weight-sharing views is utilized tolearn the representations for the two augmented samples (from each image). Thelearned representations are then fed to ISM and JC-SLIM for jointinstance-level and cluster-level contrastive learning, respectively, duringwhich an auto-encoder in JC-SLIM is also pretrained to serve as a bridge to theM-GCN module. Further, to enforce multi-scale neighborhood structure learning,two streams of GCNs and the auto-encoder are simultaneously trained via (i) thelayer-wise interaction with representation fusion and (ii) the jointself-adaptive learning. Experiments on multiple image datasets demonstrate thesuperior clustering performance of IcicleGCN over the state-of-the-art.

Recent approachesattempt to tackle this challenge by introducing video-2D representations todegrade video editing to image editing. However, they encounter significantdifficulties in handling large-scale motion- and view-change videos especiallyfor human-centric videos. This motivates us to introduce the dynamic NeuralRadiance Fields (NeRF) as the human-centric video representation to ease thevideo editing problem to a 3D space editing task. As such, editing can beperformed in the 3D spaces and propagated to the entire video via thedeformation field. To provide finer and direct controllable editing, we proposethe image-based 3D space editing pipeline with a set of effective designs.These include multi-view multi-pose Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) from both2D personalized diffusion priors and 3D diffusion priors, reconstruction losseson the reference image, text-guided local parts super-resolution, and styletransfer for 3D background space.

Generatingsummaries based on different readability levels is critical for enablingknowledge consumption by diverse audiences. However, current text generationapproaches lack refined control, resulting in texts that are not customized toreaders' proficiency levels. In this work, we bridge this gap and studytechniques to generate summaries at specified readability levels. Unlikeprevious methods that focus on a specific readability level (e.g., laysummarization), we generate summaries with fine-grained control over theirreadability. We develop three text generation techniques for controllingreadability: (1) instruction-based readability control, (2) reinforcementlearning to minimize the gap between requested and observed readability and (3)a decoding approach that uses lookahead to estimate the readability of upcomingdecoding steps. We show that our generation methods significantly improvereadability control on news summarization (CNN/DM dataset), as measured byvarious readability metrics and human judgement, establishing strong baselinesfor controllable readability in summarization.</description><author>Leonardo F.

Surprising Differences in Causality-Based Localization vs. Knowledge Editing in Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04213v2</link><description>Language models learn a great quantity of factual information duringpretraining, and recent work localizes this information to specific modelweights like mid-layer MLP weights. In this paper, we find that we can changehow a fact is stored in a model by editing weights that are in a differentlocation than where existing methods suggest that the fact is stored. This issurprising because we would expect that localizing facts to specific modelparameters would tell us where to manipulate knowledge in models, and thisassumption has motivated past work on model editing methods. Specifically, weshow that localization conclusions from representation denoising (also known asCausal Tracing) do not provide any insight into which model MLP layer would bebest to edit in order to override an existing stored fact with a new one. Thisfinding raises questions about how past work relies on Causal Tracing to selectwhich model layers to edit. Next, we consider several variants of the editingproblem, including erasing and amplifying facts. For one of our editingproblems, editing performance does relate to localization results fromrepresentation denoising, but we find that which layer we edit is a far betterpredictor of performance. Our results suggest, counterintuitively, that bettermechanistic understanding of how pretrained language models work may not alwaystranslate to insights about how to best change their behavior.

A Case Study on Learning with Representations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10616v1</link><description>While large language models based on the transformer architecture havedemonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, understandingsof such capabilities are still in an early stage, where existing theory andmechanistic understanding focus mostly on simple scenarios such as learningsimple function classes. This paper takes initial steps on understanding ICL inmore complex scenarios, by studying learning with representations. Concretely,we construct synthetic in-context learning problems with a compositionalstructure, where the label depends on the input through a possibly complex butfixed representation function, composed with a linear function that differs ineach instance. By construction, the optimal ICL algorithm first transforms theinputs by the representation function, and then performs linear ICL on top ofthe transformed dataset. We show theoretically the existence of transformersthat approximately implement such algorithms with mild depth and size.Empirically, we find trained transformers consistently achieve near-optimal ICLperformance in this setting, and exhibit the desired dissection where lowerlayers transforms the dataset and upper layers perform linear ICL. Throughextensive probing and a new pasting experiment, we further reveal severalmechanisms within the trained transformers, such as concrete copying behaviorson both the inputs and the representations, linear ICL capability of the upperlayers alone, and a post-ICL representation selection mechanism in a hardermixture setting. These observed mechanisms align well with our theory and mayshed light on how transformers perform ICL in more realistic scenarios.</description><author>Tianyu Guo, Wei Hu, Song Mei, Huan Wang, Caiming Xiong, Silvio Savarese, Yu Bai</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 18:40:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10616v1</guid></item><item><title>IW-GAE: Importance weighted group accuracy estimation for improved calibration and model selection in unsupervised domain adaptation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10611v1</link><description>Reasoning about a model's accuracy on a test sample from its confidence is acentral problem in machine learning, being connected to important applicationssuch as uncertainty representation, model selection, and exploration.

Even just measuring robustness is a challenge. Adversarialperturbations are the default, but they can paint the wrong picture: they cancorrespond to human motions that are unlikely to occur during naturalinteractions with people. A robot policy might fail under small adversarialperturbations but work under large natural perturbations. We propose thatcapturing robustness in these interactive settings requires constructing andanalyzing the entire natural-adversarial frontier: the Pareto-frontier of humanpolicies that are the best trade-offs between naturalness and low robotperformance. We introduce RIGID, a method for constructing this frontier bytraining adversarial human policies that trade off between minimizing robotreward and acting human-like (as measured by a discriminator). On an AssistiveGym task, we use RIGID to analyze the performance of standard collaborativeReinforcement Learning, as well as the performance of existing methods meant toincrease robustness. We also compare the frontier RIGID identifies with thefailures identified in expert adversarial interaction, and withnaturally-occurring failures during user interaction. Overall, we find evidencethat RIGID can provide a meaningful measure of robustness predictive ofdeployment performance, and uncover failure cases in human-robot interactionthat are difficult to find manually. https://ood-human.github.io.</description><author>Jerry Zhi-Yang He, Zackory Erickson, Daniel S.

We develop a new offline-onlinereinforcement learning method RLSynC for synthon completion insemi-template-based methods. RLSynC assigns one agent to each synthon, all ofwhich complete the synthons by conducting actions step by step in asynchronized fashion. RLSynC learns the policy from both offline trainingepisodes and online interactions which allow RLSynC to explore new reactionspaces. RLSynC uses a forward synthesis model to evaluate the likelihood of thepredicted reactants in synthesizing a product, and thus guides the actionsearch. We compare RLSynC with the state-of-the-art retrosynthesis methods. Ourexperimental results demonstrate that RLSynC can outperform these methods withimprovement as high as 14.9% on synthon completion, and 14.0% onretrosynthesis, highlighting its potential in synthesis planning.</description><author>Frazier N.

However, DR often requires carefultuning of randomization parameters. Methods like Bayesian Domain Randomization(Bayesian DR) and Active Domain Randomization (Adaptive DR) address this issueby automating parameter range selection using real-world experience. Whileeffective, these algorithms often require long computation time, as a newpolicy is trained from scratch every iteration. In this work, we proposeAdaptive Bayesian Domain Randomization via Strategic Fine-tuning (BayRnTune),which inherits the spirit of BayRn but aims to significantly accelerate thelearning processes by fine-tuning from previously learned policy. This idealeads to a critical question: which previous policy should we use as a priorduring fine-tuning? We investigated four different fine-tuning strategies andcompared them against baseline algorithms in five simulated environments,ranging from simple benchmark tasks to more complex legged robot environments.Our analysis demonstrates that our method yields better rewards in the sameamount of timesteps compared to vanilla domain randomization or Bayesian DR.</description><author>Tianle Huang, Nitish Sontakke, K.

In response, we propose an approach toenhance the efficiency and accuracy of neural network wavefield solutions bymodeling them as linear combinations of Gabor basis functions that satisfy thewave equation.

These weights/coefficients of the Gaborfunctions are learned from the previous hidden layers that include nonlinearactivation functions. To ensure the Gabor layer's utilization across the modelspace, we incorporate a smaller auxiliary network to forecast the center ofeach Gabor function based on input coordinates.

How cognition arises from neural activity is acentral open question in neuroscience, inextricable from the study ofintelligence itself. A simple formal model of neural activity was proposed inPapadimitriou [2020] and has been subsequently shown, through both mathematicalproofs and simulations, to be capable of implementing certain simple cognitiveoperations via the creation and manipulation of assemblies of neurons. However,many intelligent behaviors rely on the ability to recognize, store, andmanipulate temporal sequences of stimuli (planning, language, navigation, tolist a few). Here we show that, in the same model, time can be capturednaturally as precedence through synaptic weights and plasticity, and, as aresult, a range of computations on sequences of assemblies can be carried out.In particular, repeated presentation of a sequence of stimuli leads to thememorization of the sequence through corresponding neural assemblies: uponfuture presentation of any stimulus in the sequence, the corresponding assemblyand its subsequent ones will be activated, one after the other, until the endof the sequence. Finally, we show that any finite state machine can be learnedin a similar way, through the presentation of appropriate patterns ofsequences. Through an extension of this mechanism, the model can be shown to becapable of universal computation. We support our analysis with a number ofexperiments to probe the limits of learning in this model in key ways. Takentogether, these results provide a concrete hypothesis for the basis of thebrain's remarkable abilities to compute and learn, with sequences playing avital role.</description><author>Max Dabagia, Christos H.

To overcome this issue,we propose \textit{Multi-Hypothesis \textbf{P}ose \textbf{Syn}thesis\textbf{D}omain \textbf{A}daptation} (\textbf{PoSynDA}) framework to bridgethis data disparity gap in target domain. Typically, PoSynDA uses adiffusion-inspired structure to simulate 3D pose distribution in the targetdomain. By incorporating a multi-hypothesis network, PoSynDA generates diversepose hypotheses and aligns them with the target domain. To do this, it firstutilizes target-specific source augmentation to obtain the target domaindistribution data from the source domain by decoupling the scale and positionparameters. The process is then further refined through the teacher-studentparadigm and low-rank adaptation.

Compared to language and imagemodalities, training efficiency remains a serious problem as existing studiestrain models on massive sparse videos aligned with brief descriptions. In thispaper, we introduce BiLL-VTG, a fast adaptive framework that leverages largelanguage models (LLMs) to reasoning on videos based on essential lightweightvisual tools. Specifically, we reveal the key to response specific instructionsis the concentration on relevant video events, and utilize two visual tools ofstructured scene graph generation and descriptive image caption generation togather and represent the events information. Thus, a LLM equipped with worldknowledge is adopted as the reasoning agent to achieve the response byperforming multiple reasoning steps on specified video events.To address thedifficulty of specifying events from agent, we further propose anInstruction-oriented Video Events Recognition (InsOVER) algorithm based on theefficient Hungarian matching to localize corresponding video events usinglinguistic instructions, enabling LLMs to interact with long videos. Extensiveexperiments on two typical video-based texts generations tasks show that ourtuning-free framework outperforms the pre-trained models includingFlamingo-80B, to achieve the state-of-the-art performance.</description><author>Ji Qi, Kaixuan Ji, Jifan Yu, Duokang Wang, Bin Xu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 18:05:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10586v1</guid></item><item><title>Who Are All The Stochastic Parrots Imitating?

Thisproblem is especially severe for low-resource languages, where training data isscarce and of worse quality than for high-resource languages. In this opinionpiece, we argue that LMs in their current state will never be fully trustworthyin critical settings and suggest a possible novel strategy to handle thisissue: by building LMs such that can cite their sources - i.e., point a user tothe parts of their training data that back up their outputs. We first discusswhich current NLP tasks would or would not benefit from such models. We thenhighlight the expected benefits such models would bring, e.g., quickverifiability of statements. We end by outlining the individual tasks thatwould need to be solved on the way to developing LMs with the ability to cite.We hope to start a discussion about the field's current approach to buildingLMs, especially for low-resource languages, and the role of the training datain explaining model generations.</description><author>Sagi Shaier, Lawrence E.

For medical images, a feature attribution map, or heatmap, is the mostcommon form of explanation that highlights important features for AI models'prediction. However, it is unknown how well heatmaps perform on explainingdecisions on multi-modal medical images, where each image modality or channelvisualizes distinct clinical information of the same underlying biomedicalphenomenon. Understanding such modality-dependent features is essential forclinical users' interpretation of AI decisions. To tackle this clinicallyimportant but technically ignored problem, we propose the modality-specificfeature importance (MSFI) metric. It encodes clinical image and explanationinterpretation patterns of modality prioritization and modality-specificfeature localization. We conduct a clinical requirement-grounded, systematicevaluation using computational methods and a clinician user study. Results showthat the examined 16 heatmap algorithms failed to fulfill clinical requirementsto correctly indicate AI model decision process or decision quality. Theevaluation and MSFI metric can guide the design and selection of XAI algorithmsto meet clinical requirements on multi-modal explanation.</description><author>Weina Jin, Xiaoxiao Li, Ghassan Hamarneh</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 17:53:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06487v2</guid></item><item><title>Matching the Neuronal Representations of V1 is Necessary to Improve Robustness in CNNs with V1-like Front-ends</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10575v1</link><description>While some convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great successin object recognition, they struggle to identify objects in images corruptedwith different types of common noise patterns. Recently, it was shown thatsimulating computations in early visual areas at the front of CNNs leads toimprovements in robustness to image corruptions. Here, we further explore thisresult and show that the neuronal representations that emerge from preciselymatching the distribution of RF properties found in primate V1 is key for thisimprovement in robustness. We built two variants of a model with a front-endmodeling the primate primary visual cortex (V1): one sampling RF propertiesuniformly and the other sampling from empirical biological distributions. Themodel with the biological sampling has a considerably higher robustness toimage corruptions that the uniform variant (relative difference of 8.72%).While similar neuronal sub-populations across the two variants have similarresponse properties and learn similar downstream weights, the impact ondownstream processing is strikingly different. This result sheds light on theorigin of the improvements in robustness observed in some biologically-inspiredmodels, pointing to the need of precisely mimicking the neuronalrepresentations found in the primate brain.</description><author>Ruxandra Barbulescu, Tiago Marques, Arlindo L.

Selecting only questions on biomedical topics whose answers do notdepend on ethnicity, sex, or sexual orientation, we ask the following researchquestions: (RQ1) Do the answers of QA models change when being provided withirrelevant demographic information? (RQ2) Does the answer of RQ1 differ betweenknowledge graph (KG)-grounded and text-based QA systems? We find thatirrelevant demographic information change up to 15% of the answers of aKG-grounded system and up to 23% of the answers of a text-based system,including changes that affect accuracy.

Recent advancements haveextended their capabilities to handle long-input contexts, surpassing tokenlimits of 32k or more. However, in the realm of multi-document questionanswering, language models exhibit uneven utilization of their input context.They tend to favor the initial and final segments, resulting in a U-shapedperformance pattern concerning where the answer is located within the input.This bias raises concerns, particularly in summarization tasks where crucialcontent may be dispersed throughout the source document(s). This paper presentsa comprehensive investigation encompassing 10 datasets, 4 LLMs, and 5evaluation metrics to analyze how these models leverage their input forabstractive summarization. Our findings reveal a pronounced bias towards theintroductory content (and to a lesser extent, the final content), posingchallenges for LLM performance across a range of diverse summarizationbenchmarks.</description><author>Mathieu Ravaut, Shafiq Joty, Aixin Sun, Nancy F.

However,current research faces two main problems: 1) determining what information toretrieve, and 2) effectively combining retrieved information during generation.We argue that valuable retrieved information should not only be related to thecurrent source text but also consider the future target text, given the natureof LMs that model future tokens. Moreover, we propose that aggregation usinglatent variables derived from a compact latent space is more efficient thanutilizing explicit raw text, which is limited by context length and susceptibleto noise. Therefore, we introduce RegaVAE, a retrieval-augmented language modelbuilt upon the variational auto-encoder (VAE). It encodes the text corpus intoa latent space, capturing current and future information from both source andtarget text. Additionally, we leverage the VAE to initialize the latent spaceand adopt the probabilistic form of the retrieval generation paradigm byexpanding the Gaussian prior distribution into a Gaussian mixture distribution.Theoretical analysis provides an optimizable upper bound for RegaVAE.Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate significant improvementsin text generation quality and hallucination removal.</description><author>Jingcheng Deng, Liang Pang, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 17:42:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10567v1</guid></item><item><title>HelmSim: Learning Helmholtz Dynamics for Interpretable Fluid Simulation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10565v1</link><description>Fluid simulation is a long-standing challenge due to the intrinsichigh-dimensional non-linear dynamics.

However, skipping over inherent physicalproperties but directly learning superficial velocity fields will overwhelm themodel from generating precise or physics-reliable results. In this paper, wepropose the HelmSim toward an accurate and interpretable simulator for fluid.Inspired by the Helmholtz theorem, we design a HelmDynamic block to learn theHelmholtz dynamics, which decomposes fluid dynamics into more solvablecurl-free and divergence-free parts, physically corresponding to potential andstream functions of fluid. By embedding the HelmDynamic block into a MultiscaleIntegration Network, HelmSim can integrate learned Helmholtz dynamics alongtemporal dimension in multiple spatial scales to yield future fluid. Comparingwith previous velocity estimating methods, HelmSim is faithfully derived fromHelmholtz theorem and ravels out complex fluid dynamics with physicallyinterpretable evidence.

Specifically, given a pre-trainedmodel, RefConv applies a trainable Refocusing Transformation to the basiskernels inherited from the pre-trained model to establish connections among theparameters. For example, a depth-wise RefConv can relate the parameters of aspecific channel of convolution kernel to the parameters of the other kernel,i.e., make them refocus on the other parts of the model they have neverattended to, rather than focus on the input features only. From anotherperspective, RefConv augments the priors of existing model structures byutilizing the representations encoded in the pre-trained parameters as thepriors and refocusing on them to learn novel representations, thus furtherenhancing the representational capacity of the pre-trained model. Experimentalresults validated that RefConv can improve multiple CNN-based models by a clearmargin on image classification (up to 1.47% higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet),object detection and semantic segmentation without introducing any extrainference costs or altering the original model structure. Further studiesdemonstrated that RefConv can reduce the redundancy of channels and smooth theloss landscape, which explains its effectiveness.</description><author>Zhicheng Cai, Xiaohan Ding, Qiu Shen, Xun Cao</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 17:36:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10563v1</guid></item><item><title>Towards the Imagenets of ML4EDA</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10560v1</link><description>Despite the growing interest in ML-guided EDA tools from RTL to GDSII, thereare no standard datasets or prototypical learning tasks defined for the EDAproblem domain.

Under unconfoundedness, we target the IndividualTreatment Effect (ITE) estimation with unobserved heterogeneity in thetreatment response due to missing risk factors. We address the challenges posedby time-varying effects and unobserved adjustment variables. Led by theoreticalresults over the validity of the learned adjustment variables andgeneralization bounds over the treatment effect, we devise Causal DVAE (CDVAE).This model combines a Dynamic Variational Autoencoder (DVAE) framework with aweighting strategy using propensity scores to estimate counterfactualresponses. The CDVAE model allows for accurate estimation of ITE and capturesthe underlying heterogeneity in longitudinal data.

Several cluster validity indexes have been introduced toaddress this problem. However, in some situations, there is more than oneoption that can be chosen as the final number of clusters. This aspect has beenoverlooked by most of the existing works in this area. In this study, weintroduce a correlation-based fuzzy cluster validity index known as theWiroonsri-Preedasawakul (WP) index. This index is defined based on thecorrelation between the actual distance between a pair of data points and thedistance between adjusted centroids with respect to that pair. We evaluate andcompare the performance of our index with several existing indexes, includingXie-Beni, Pakhira-Bandyopadhyay-Maulik, Tang, Wu-Li, generalized C, and Kwon2.We conduct this evaluation on four types of datasets: artificial datasets,real-world datasets, simulated datasets with ranks, and image datasets, usingthe fuzzy c-means algorithm. Overall, the WP index outperforms most, if notall, of these indexes in terms of accurately detecting the optimal number ofclusters and providing accurate secondary options. Moreover, our index remainseffective even when the fuzziness parameter $m$ is set to a large value.

However, in practice,transformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a "chain ofthought" or "scratchpad", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence ofintermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does suchintermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of adecoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount ofincrease depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. Forinstance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number ofdecoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standardtransformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps adds aclear new ability (under standard complexity conjectures): recognizing allregular languages. Our results also imply that linear steps keep transformerdecoders within context-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps make themrecognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems -- the firstexact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standardcomplexity classes. Together, our results provide a nuanced framework forunderstanding how the length of a transformer's chain of thought or scratchpadimpacts its reasoning power.</description><author>William Merrill, Ashish Sabharwal</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 17:30:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07923v2</guid></item><item><title>Sample Complexity of Preference-Based Nonparametric Off-Policy Evaluation with Deep Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10556v1</link><description>A recently popular approach to solving reinforcement learning is with datafrom human preferences. In fact, human preference data are now used withclassic reinforcement learning algorithms such as actor-critic methods, whichinvolve evaluating an intermediate policy over a reward learned from humanpreference data with distribution shift, known as off-policy evaluation (OPE).Such algorithm includes (i) learning reward function from human preferencedataset, and (ii) learning expected cumulative reward of a target policy.Despite the huge empirical success, existing OPE methods with preference dataoften lack theoretical understanding and rely heavily on heuristics. In thispaper, we study the sample efficiency of OPE with human preference andestablish a statistical guarantee for it. Specifically, we approach OPE bylearning the value function by fitted-Q-evaluation with a deep neural network.By appropriately selecting the size of a ReLU network, we show that one canleverage any low-dimensional manifold structure in the Markov decision processand obtain a sample-efficient estimator without suffering from the curse ofhigh data ambient dimensionality. Under the assumption of high rewardsmoothness, our results \textit{almost align with the classical OPE resultswith observable reward data}.

Structural health monitoring provides a means of costreduction through minimising unnecessary maintenance trips as well asprolonging turbine service life. Population-based structural health monitoringcan further reduce the cost of health monitoring systems by implementing onesystem for multiple structures (i.e.~turbines). At the same time, shared datawithin a population of structures may improve the predictions of structuralbehaviour. To monitor turbine performance at a population/farm level, animportant initial step is to construct a model that describes the behaviour ofall turbines under normal conditions. This paper proposes a population-levelmodel that explicitly captures the spatial and temporal correlations (betweenturbines) induced by the wake effect. The proposed model is a Gaussianprocess-based spatial autoregressive model, named here a GP-SPARX model. Thisapproach is developed since (a) it reflects our physical understanding of thewake effect, and (b) it benefits from a stochastic data-based learner. A casestudy is provided to demonstrate the capability of the GP-SPARX model incapturing spatial and temporal variations as well as its potentialapplicability in a health monitoring system.</description><author>W.

However, these modelsexhibit a key limitation: they necessitate complete action observation prior toclassification, which constrains their applicability in real-time situationssuch as surveillance and robotic systems. To overcome this barrier, weintroduce InfoGCN++, an innovative extension of InfoGCN, explicitly developedfor online skeleton-based action recognition. InfoGCN++ augments the abilitiesof the original InfoGCN model by allowing real-time categorization of actiontypes, independent of the observation sequence's length. It transcendsconventional approaches by learning from current and anticipated futuremovements, thereby creating a more thorough representation of the entiresequence. Our approach to prediction is managed as an extrapolation issue,grounded on observed actions. To enable this, InfoGCN++ incorporates NeuralOrdinary Differential Equations, a concept that lets it effectively model thecontinuous evolution of hidden states. Following rigorous evaluations on threeskeleton-based action recognition benchmarks, InfoGCN++ demonstratesexceptional performance in online action recognition. It consistently equals orexceeds existing techniques, highlighting its significant potential to reshapethe landscape of real-time action recognition applications. Consequently, thiswork represents a major leap forward from InfoGCN, pushing the limits of what'spossible in online, skeleton-based action recognition.

Perhaps the most widely used vintage factor analysisis the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by the varimax rotation.Despite its popularity, little theoretical guarantee can be provided mainlybecause varimax rotation requires to solve a non-convex optimization over theset of orthogonal matrices. In this paper, we propose a deflation varimax procedure that solves each rowof an orthogonal matrix sequentially. In addition to its net computational gainand flexibility, we are able to fully establish theoretical guarantees for theproposed procedure in a broad context. Adopting this new varimax approach as the second step after PCA, we furtheranalyze this two step procedure under a general class of factor models. Ourresults show that it estimates the factor loading matrix in the optimal ratewhen the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is moderate or large. In the low SNRregime, we offer possible improvement over using PCA and the deflationprocedure when the additive noise under the factor model is structured. Themodified procedure is shown to be optimal in all SNR regimes.

Communication issuccessful to the extent that the listener grasps what the speaker means toconvey and, if communication is successful, two individuals can potentiallycoordinate their actions based on shared knowledge about uncertainty. We firstassessed human ability to estimate the probability and the ambiguity(imprecision) of 23 probabilistic phrases in two different contexts, investmentadvice and medical advice. We then had GPT4 (OpenAI), a recent Large LanguageModel, complete the same tasks as the human participants. We found that themedian human participant and GPT4 assigned probability estimates that were ingood agreement (proportions of variance accounted were close to .90). GPT4'sestimates of probability both in the investment and Medical contexts were asclose or closer to that of the human participants as the human participantswere to one another. Estimates of probability for both the human participantsand GPT4 were little affected by context. In contrast, human and GPT4 estimatesof ambiguity were not in as good agreement. We repeated some of the GPT4estimates to assess their stability: does GPT4, if run twice, produce the sameor similar estimates? There is some indication that it does not.</description><author>Laurence T Maloney, Maria F Dal Martello, Vivian Fei, Valerie Ma</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 17:14:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10544v1</guid></item><item><title>ViPE: Visualise Pretty-much Everything</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10543v1</link><description>Figurative and non-literal expressions are profoundly integrated in humancommunication. Visualising such expressions allow us to convey our creativethoughts, and evoke nuanced emotions. Recent text-to-image models like StableDiffusion, on the other hand, struggle to depict non-literal expressions.Recent works primarily deal with this issue by compiling humanly annotateddatasets on a small scale, which not only demands specialised expertise butalso proves highly inefficient. To address this issue, we introduce ViPE:Visualise Pretty-much Everything. ViPE offers a series of lightweight androbust language models that have been trained on a large-scale set of lyricswith noisy visual descriptions that represent their implicit meaning. Thesynthetic visual descriptions are generated by GPT3.5 relying on neither humanannotations nor images. ViPE effectively expresses any arbitrary piece of textinto a visualisable description, enabling meaningful and high-quality imagegeneration. We provide compelling evidence that ViPE is more robust than GPT3.5in synthesising visual elaborations. ViPE also exhibits an understanding offigurative expressions comparable to human experts, providing a powerful andopen-source backbone to many downstream applications such as music video andcaption generation.</description><author>Hassan Shahmohammadi, Adhiraj Ghosh, Hendrik P.

Someresearchers opt to distil information from real-world datasets into tiny andcompact synthetic datasets while maintaining their ability to train awell-performing model, hence proposing a data-efficient method known as DatasetDistillation (DD). Despite recent progress in this field, existing methodsstill underperform and cannot effectively replace large datasets. In thispaper, unlike previous methods that focus solely on improving the efficacy ofstudent distillation, we are the first to recognize the important interplaybetween expert and student. We argue the significant impact of expertsmoothness when employing more potent expert trajectories in subsequent datasetdistillation. Based on this, we introduce the integration of clipping loss andgradient penalty to regulate the rate of parameter changes in experttrajectories. Furthermore, in response to the sensitivity exhibited towardsrandomly initialized variables during distillation, we propose representativeinitialization for synthetic dataset and balanced inner-loop loss. Finally, wepresent two enhancement strategies, namely intermediate matching loss andweight perturbation, to mitigate the potential occurrence of cumulative errors.We conduct extensive experiments on datasets of different scales, sizes, andresolutions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantlyoutperforms prior methods.</description><author>Jiyuan Shen, Wenzhuo Yang, Kwok-Yan Lam</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 17:13:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10541v1</guid></item><item><title>Improving Anomaly Segmentation with Multi-Granularity Cross-Domain Alignment</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08696v2</link><description>Anomaly segmentation plays a pivotal role in identifying atypical objects inimages, crucial for hazard detection in autonomous driving systems.

This is usually split into two sub-tasks:text localization and optical character recognition (OCR). Most existing OCRmodels only focus on the cropped text instance images, which require thebounding box information provided by a text region detection model. Introducingan additional detector to identify the text instance images in advance addscomplexity, however instance-level OCR models have very low accuracy whenprocessing the whole image for the document-level OCR, such as receipt imagescontaining multiple text lines arranged in various layouts. To this end, wepropose a localization-free document-level OCR model for transcribing all thecharacters in a receipt image into an ordered sequence end-to-end.Specifically, we finetune the pretrained instance-level model TrOCR withrandomly cropped image chunks, and gradually increase the image chunk size togeneralize the recognition ability from instance images to full-page images. Inour experiments on the SROIE receipt OCR dataset, the model finetuned with ourstrategy achieved 64.4 F1-score and a 22.8% character error rate (CER),respectively, which outperforms the baseline results with 48.5 F1-score and50.6% CER. The best model, which splits the full image into 15 equally sizedchunks, gives 87.8 F1-score and 4.98% CER with minimal additional pre orpost-processing of the output. Moreover, the characters in the generateddocument-level sequences are arranged in the reading order, which is practicalfor real-world applications.</description><author>Hongkuan Zhang, Edward Whittaker, Ikuo Kitagishi</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 17:11:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05525v3</guid></item><item><title>Microscaling Data Formats for Deep Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10537v1</link><description>Narrow bit-width data formats are key to reducing the computational andstorage costs of modern deep learning applications.

Moreover, GLoRA facilitates efficientparameter adaptation by employing a scalable, modular, layer-wise structuresearch that learns individual adapter of each layer. Originating from a unifiedmathematical formulation, GLoRA exhibits strong transfer learning, few-shotlearning and domain generalization abilities, as it adapts to new tasks throughnot only weights but also additional dimensions like activations. Comprehensiveexperiments demonstrate that GLoRA outperforms all previous methods in natural,specialized, and structured vision benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy withfewer parameters and computations. The proposed method on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2also show considerable enhancements compared to the original LoRA in thelanguage domain.

The effectiveness of ZS-XLThinges on the linguistic proximity between languages and the amount ofpretraining data for a language. Because of this, model selection based onsource-language validation is unreliable: it picks model snapshots withsuboptimal target-language performance. As a remedy, some work optimizes ZS-XLTby extensively tuning hyperparameters: the follow-up work then routinelystruggles to replicate the original results. Other work searches over narrowerhyperparameter grids, reporting substantially lower performance. In this work,we therefore propose an unsupervised evaluation protocol for ZS-XLT thatdecouples performance maximization from hyperparameter tuning. As a robust andmore transparent alternative to extensive hyperparameter tuning, we propose toaccumulatively average snapshots from different runs into a single model. Werun broad ZS-XLT experiments on both higher-level semantic tasks (NLI,extractive QA) and a lower-level token classification task (NER) and find thatconventional model selection based on source-language validation quicklyplateaus to suboptimal ZS-XLT performance. On the other hand, our accumulativerun-by-run averaging of models trained with different hyperparameters boostsZS-XLT performance and closely correlates with "oracle" ZS-XLT, i.e., modelselection based on target-language validation performance.</description><author>Fabian David Schmidt, Ivan VuliÄ, Goran GlavaÅ¡</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 16:50:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10532v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning optimal integration of spatial and temporal information in noisy chemotaxis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10531v1</link><description>We investigate the boundary between chemotaxis driven by spatial estimationof gradients and chemotaxis driven by temporal estimation.

Mathematically, underlying phenomenon can be captured via astable $n$-dimensional linear transformation `$A$' and additive randomness.System identification aims at extracting useful information about underlyingdynamical system, given a length $N$ trajectory from it (corresponds to an $n\times N$ dimensional data matrix). We use spectral theorem for non-Hermitianoperators to show that spatio-temperal correlations are dictated by thediscrepancy between algebraic and geometric multiplicity of distincteigenvalues corresponding to state transition matrix. Small discrepancies implythat original trajectory essentially comprises of multiple lower dimensionalrandom dynamical systems living on $A$ invariant subspaces and arestatistically independent of each other.

It is shown that when a stable dynamical system has only onedistinct eigenvalue and discrepancy of $n-1$: $\|A\|$ has a dependence on $n$,resulting dynamics are spatially inseparable and consequently there exist atleast one row with covariates of typical size $\Theta\big(\sqrt{N-n+1}$$e^{n}\big)$ i.e., even under stability assumption, covariates can suffer fromcurse of dimensionality.

Traditionally, task-specific models are developed for individualtasks and designing such models requires distinct expertise. Building upon thesuccess of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP),there is a similar trend in computer vision, which focuses on developinglarge-scale models through pretraining and in-context learning. This paradigmshift reduces the reliance on task-specific models, yielding a powerful unifiedmodel to deal with various tasks.

To address this issue, we propose a universal model for generalimage processing that covers image restoration, image enhancement, imagefeature extraction tasks, \textit{etc}. Our proposed framework, namedPromptGIP, unifies these diverse image processing tasks within a universalframework. Inspired by NLP question answering (QA) techniques, we employ avisual prompting question answering paradigm. Specifically, we treat theinput-output image pair as a structured question-answer sentence, therebyreprogramming the image processing task as a prompting QA problem.

Existing methods havesolved the challenges in traffic flow prediction partly, focusing on modelingspatial-temporal dependencies effectively, while not all intrinsic propertiesof traffic flow data are utilized fully. Besides, there are very few attemptsat incremental learning of spatial-temporal data mining, and few previous workscan be easily transferred to the traffic flow prediction task. Motivated by thechallenge of incremental learning methods for traffic flow prediction and theunderutilization of intrinsic properties of road networks, we propose aTransport-Hub-aware Spatial-Temporal adaptive graph transFormer (H-STFormer)for traffic flow prediction.

The predominant strategy to address this is through ReinforcementLearning from Human Feedback (RLHF), where PPO serves as the de-factoalgorithm. Yet, PPO is known to suffer from computational inefficiency, achallenge that this paper aims to address. We identify three importantproperties in RLHF tasks: fast simulation, deterministic transitions, andtrajectory-level rewards, which are not leveraged in PPO. Based on suchobservations, we develop a new algorithm tailored for RLHF, called ReMax. Thealgorithm design of ReMax is built on a celebrated algorithm REINFORCE but isequipped with a new variance-reduction technique. Our method has three-fold advantages over PPO: first, it saves about 50%memory usage in principle. As a result, PPO runs out-of-memory when fine-tuninga Llama2 (7B) model on 8xA100-40GB GPUs, whereas ReMax can afford training.This memory improvement is achieved by removing the value model in PPO. Second,ReMax is simple to implement and removes many hyper-parameters in PPO, whichare scale-sensitive and laborious to tune.

However, sharp bounds for causal effects underrelaxations of the unconfoundedness assumption (causal sensitivity analysis)are subject to ongoing research. So far, works with sharp bounds are restrictedto fairly simple settings (e.g., a single binary treatment). In this paper, wepropose a unified framework for causal sensitivity analysis under unobservedconfounding in various settings. For this, we propose a flexible generalizationof the marginal sensitivity model (MSM) and then derive sharp bounds for alarge class of causal effects. This includes (conditional) average treatmenteffects, effects for mediation analysis and path analysis, and distributionaleffects. Furthermore, our sensitivity model is applicable to discrete,continuous, and time-varying treatments.

Guardrails (or rails for short)are a specific way of controlling the output of an LLM, such as not talkingabout topics considered harmful, following a predefined dialogue path, using aparticular language style, and more. There are several mechanisms that allowLLM providers and developers to add guardrails that are embedded into aspecific model at training, e.g. using model alignment. Differently, using aruntime inspired from dialogue management, NeMo Guardrails allows developers toadd programmable rails to LLM applications - these are user-defined,independent of the underlying LLM, and interpretable. Our initial results showthat the proposed approach can be used with several LLM providers to developcontrollable and safe LLM applications using programmable rails.</description><author>Traian Rebedea, Razvan Dinu, Makesh Sreedhar, Christopher Parisien, Jonathan Cohen</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 16:20:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10501v1</guid></item><item><title>Few-Shot Learning Patterns in Financial Time-Series for Trend-Following Strategies</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10500v1</link><description>Forecasting models for systematic trading strategies do not adapt quicklywhen financial market conditions change, as was seen in the advent of theCOVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when market conditions changed dramatically causingmany forecasting models to take loss-making positions. To deal with suchsituations, we propose a novel time-series trend-following forecaster that isable to quickly adapt to new market conditions, referred to as regimes. Weleverage recent developments from the deep learning community and use few-shotlearning. We propose the Cross Attentive Time-Series Trend Network - X-Trend -which takes positions attending over a context set of financial time-seriesregimes. X-Trend transfers trends from similar patterns in the context set tomake predictions and take positions for a new distinct target regime. X-Trendis able to quickly adapt to new financial regimes with a Sharpe ratio increaseof 18.9% over a neural forecaster and 10-fold over a conventional Time-seriesMomentum strategy during the turbulent market period from 2018 to 2023. Ourstrategy recovers twice as quickly from the COVID-19 drawdown compared to theneural-forecaster. X-Trend can also take zero-shot positions on novel unseenfinancial assets obtaining a 5-fold Sharpe ratio increase versus a neuraltime-series trend forecaster over the same period. X-Trend both forecastsnext-day prices and outputs a trading signal. Furthermore, the cross-attentionmechanism allows us to interpret the relationship between forecasts andpatterns in the context set.</description><author>Kieran Wood, Samuel Kessler, Stephen J.

One of the mostpressing problems related to generation of abstractive summaries is the need toreduce "hallucinations," information that was not included in the documentbeing summarized, and which may be wholly incorrect. Due to this need, a widearray of metrics estimating consistency with the text being summarized havebeen proposed. We examine in particular a suite of unsupervised metrics forsummary consistency, and measure their correlations with each other and withhuman evaluation scores in the wiki_bio_gpt3_hallucination dataset. We thencompare these evaluations to models made from a simple linear ensemble of thesemetrics. We find that LLM-based methods outperform other unsupervised metricsfor hallucination detection. We also find that ensemble methods can improvethese scores even further, provided that the metrics in the ensemble havesufficiently similar and uncorrelated error rates. Finally, we present anensemble method for LLM-based evaluations that we show improves over thisprevious SOTA.</description><author>Grant C.

However, its potential inthe context of histopathology data, specifically in region segmentation, hasreceived relatively limited attention. In this paper, we evaluate SAM'sperformance in zero-shot and fine-tuned scenarios on histopathology data, witha focus on interactive segmentation. Additionally, we compare SAM with otherstate-of-the-art interactive models to assess its practical potential andevaluate its generalization capability with domain adaptability. In theexperimental results, SAM exhibits a weakness in segmentation performancecompared to other models while demonstrating relative strengths in terms ofinference time and generalization capability. To improve SAM's limited localrefinement ability and to enhance prompt stability while preserving its corestrengths, we propose a modification of SAM's decoder.

However, theyrequire large training datasets and are generally known for lack oftransferability due to the highly disparate RS image content across differentgeographical regions. Yet, there is no comprehensive analysis of theirtransferability, i.e., to which extent a model trained on a source domain canbe readily applicable to a target domain. Therefore, in this paper, we aim toinvestigate the raw transferability of traditional and deep learning (DL)models, as well as the effectiveness of domain adaptation (DA) approaches inenhancing the transferability of the DL models (adapted transferability). Byutilizing four highly diverse RS datasets, we train six models with and withoutthree DA approaches to analyze their transferability between these datasetsquantitatively. Furthermore, we developed a straightforward method to quantifythe transferability of a model using the spectral indices as a medium and havedemonstrated its effectiveness in evaluating the model transferability at thetarget domain when the labels are unavailable. Our experiments yield severalgenerally important yet not well-reported observations regarding the raw andadapted transferability. Moreover, our proposed label-free transferabilityassessment method is validated to be better than posterior model confidence.The findings can guide the future development of generalized RS learningmodels.

This paper presentsH2RBox-v2, to further bridge the gap between HBox-supervised andRBox-supervised oriented object detection. Specifically, we propose to leveragethe reflection symmetry via flip and rotate consistencies, using aweakly-supervised network branch similar to H2RBox, together with a novelself-supervised branch that learns orientations from the symmetry inherent invisual objects. The detector is further stabilized and enhanced by practicaltechniques to cope with peripheral issues e.g. angular periodicity. To our bestknowledge, H2RBox-v2 is the first symmetry-aware self-supervised paradigm fororiented object detection. In particular, our method shows less susceptibilityto low-quality annotation and insufficient training data compared to H2RBox.Specifically, H2RBox-v2 achieves very close performance to a rotationannotation trained counterpart -- Rotated FCOS: 1) DOTA-v1.0/1.5/2.0:72.31%/64.76%/50.33% vs. 72.44%/64.53%/51.77%; 2) HRSC: 89.66% vs. 88.99%; 3)FAIR1M: 42.27% vs. 41.25%.</description><author>Yi Yu, Xue Yang, Qingyun Li, Yue Zhou, Gefan Zhang, Feipeng Da, Junchi Yan</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 16:12:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04403v4</guid></item><item><title>AV-NeRF: Learning Neural Fields for Real-World Audio-Visual Scene Synthesis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02088v3</link><description>Can machines recording an audio-visual scene produce realistic, matchingaudio-visual experiences at novel positions and novel view directions?

Therefore, this paperproposes a novel Schema-based Explicitly Aggregating~(SEA) model to addressthese limitations. SEA aggregates event information into event type and rolerepresentations, enabling the decoding of event records based on specifictype-aware representations. By detecting each event based on its event typerepresentation, SEA mitigates the interference caused by event-unrelatedinformation. Furthermore, SEA extracts arguments for each role based on itsrole-aware representations, reducing mutual interference between differentroles. Experimental results on the ChFinAnn and DuEE-fin datasets show that SEAoutperforms the SOTA methods.</description><author>Gang Zhao, Yidong Shi, Shudong Lu, Xinjie Yang, Guanting Dong, Jian Xu, Xiaocheng Gong, Si Li</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 16:10:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10487v1</guid></item><item><title>Statistical Guarantees of Group-Invariant GANs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13517v2</link><description>Group-invariant generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a type of GANs inwhich the generators and discriminators are hardwired with group symmetries.Empirical studies have shown that these networks are capable of learninggroup-invariant distributions with significantly improved data efficiency.

CST aims to answer in anactionable and meaningful way the intuitive question "what would have been themodel outcome had the individual, or complainant, been of a different protectedstatus?" It extends the legally-grounded situation testing of Thanh et al.(2011) by operationalizing the notion of fairness given the difference usingcounterfactual reasoning. For any complainant, we find and compare similarprotected and non-protected instances in the dataset used by the classifier toconstruct a control and test group, where a difference between the decisionoutcomes of the two groups implies potential individual discrimination. Unlikesituation testing, which builds both groups around the complainant, we buildthe test group on the complainant's counterfactual generated using causalknowledge. The counterfactual is intended to reflect how the protectedattribute when changed affects the seemingly neutral attributes used by theclassifier, which is taken for granted in many frameworks for discrimination.Under CST, we compare similar individuals within each group but dissimilarindividuals across both groups due to the possible difference between thecomplainant and its counterfactual. Evaluating our framework on twoclassification scenarios, we show that it uncovers a greater number of casesthan situation testing, even when the classifier satisfies the counterfactualfairness condition of Kusner et al.

The learning processmust usually be repeated for every new robot, where hyperparameters and rewardfunction weights must be re-tuned to maximize performance for each new system.Alternatively, attempting to train a single policy to accommodate differentrobot sizes, while maintaining the same degrees of freedom (DoF) andmorphology, requires either complex learning frameworks, or mass, inertia, anddimension randomization, which leads to prolonged training periods. In ourstudy, we show that drawing inspiration from animal motor control allows us toeffectively train a single locomotion policy capable of controlling a diverserange of quadruped robots. These differences encompass a variable number ofDoFs, (i.e. 12 or 16 joints), three distinct morphologies, a broad mass rangespanning from 2 kg to 200 kg, and nominal standing heights ranging from 16 cmto 100 cm. Our policy modulates a representation of the Central PatternGenerator (CPG) in the spinal cord, effectively coordinating both frequenciesand amplitudes of the CPG to produce rhythmic output (Rhythm Generation), whichis then mapped to a Pattern Formation (PF) layer. Across different robots, theonly varying component is the PF layer, which adjusts the scaling parametersfor the stride height and length. Subsequently, we evaluate the sim-to-realtransfer by testing the single policy on both the Unitree Go1 and A1 robots.Remarkably, we observe robust performance, even when adding a 15 kg load,equivalent to 125% of the A1 robot's nominal mass.</description><author>Milad Shafiee, Guillaume Bellegarda, Auke Ijspeert</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 16:06:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10486v1</guid></item><item><title>Passive Inference Attacks on Split Learning via Adversarial Regularization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10483v1</link><description>Split Learning (SL) has emerged as a practical and efficient alternative totraditional federated learning.

We introduce SDAR, a novel attackframework against SL with an honest-but-curious server. SDAR leveragesauxiliary data and adversarial regularization to learn a decodable simulator ofthe client's private model, which can effectively infer the client's privatefeatures under the vanilla SL, and both features and labels under the U-shapedSL. We perform extensive experiments in both configurations to validate theeffectiveness of our proposed attacks. Notably, in challenging but practicalscenarios where existing passive attacks struggle to reconstruct the client'sprivate data effectively, SDAR consistently achieves attack performancecomparable to active attacks. On CIFAR-10, at the deep split level of 7, SDARachieves private feature reconstruction with less than 0.025 mean squared errorin both the vanilla and the U-shaped SL, and attains a label inference accuracyof over 98% in the U-shaped setting, while existing attacks fail to producenon-trivial results.</description><author>Xiaochen Zhu, Xinjian Luo, Yuncheng Wu, Yangfan Jiang, Xiaokui Xiao, Beng Chin Ooi</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 16:03:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10483v1</guid></item><item><title>xCOMET: Transparent Machine Translation Evaluation through Fine-grained Error Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10482v1</link><description>Widely used learned metrics for machine translation evaluation, such as COMETand BLEURT, estimate the quality of a translation hypothesis by providing asingle sentence-level score.

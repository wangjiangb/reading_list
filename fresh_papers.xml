However, articulating the rigs intorealistic affordance-aware postures (e.g., following the context, respectingthe physics and the personalities of the object) remains time-consuming andheavily relies on human labor from experienced artists. In this paper, wetackle the novel problem and design A3Syn. With a given context, such as theenvironment mesh and a text prompt of the desired posture, A3Syn synthesizesarticulation parameters for arbitrary and open-domain rigged objects obtainedfrom the Internet. The task is incredibly challenging due to the lack oftraining data, and we do not make any topological assumptions about theopen-domain rigs. We propose using 2D inpainting diffusion model and severalcontrol techniques to synthesize in-context affordance information. Then, wedevelop an efficient bone correspondence alignment using a combination ofdifferentiable rendering and semantic correspondence. A3Syn has stableconvergence, completes in minutes, and synthesizes plausible affordance ondifferent combinations of in-the-wild object rigs and scenes.</description><author>Yu-Chu Yu, Chieh Hubert Lin, Hsin-Ying Lee, Chaoyang Wang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Ming-Hsuan Yang</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12393v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning segmentation from point trajectories</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12392v1</link><description>We consider the problem of segmenting objects in videos based on their motionand no other forms of supervision. Prior work has often approached this problemby using the principle of common fate, namely the fact that the motion ofpoints that belong to the same object is strongly correlated. However, mostauthors have only considered instantaneous motion from optical flow. In thiswork, we present a way to train a segmentation network using long-term pointtrajectories as a supervisory signal to complement optical flow. The keydifficulty is that long-term motion, unlike instantaneous motion, is difficultto model -- any parametric approximation is unlikely to capture complex motionpatterns over long periods of time. We instead draw inspiration from subspaceclustering approaches, proposing a loss function that seeks to group thetrajectories into low-rank matrices where the motion of object points can beapproximately explained as a linear combination of other point tracks. Ourmethod outperforms the prior art on motion-based segmentation, which shows theutility of long-term motion and the effectiveness of our formulation.</description><author>Laurynas Karazija, Iro Laina, Christian Rupprecht, Andrea Vedaldi</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:59:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12392v1</guid></item><item><title>Physics of Skill Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12391v1</link><description>We aim to understand physics of skill learning, i.e., how skills are learnedin neural networks during training. We start by observing the Domino effect,i.e., skills are learned sequentially, and notably, some skills kick offlearning right after others complete learning, similar to the sequential fallof domino cards. To understand the Domino effect and relevant behaviors ofskill learning, we take physicists' approach of abstraction and simplification.We propose three models with varying complexities -- the Geometry model, theResource model, and the Domino model, trading between reality and simplicity.The Domino effect can be reproduced in the Geometry model, whose resourceinterpretation inspires the Resource model, which can be further simplified tothe Domino model. These models present different levels of abstraction andsimplification; each is useful to study some aspects of skill learning. TheGeometry model provides interesting insights into neural scaling laws andoptimizers; the Resource model sheds light on the learning dynamics ofcompositional tasks; the Domino model reveals the benefits of modularity. Thesemodels are not only conceptually interesting -- e.g., we show how Chinchillascaling laws can emerge from the Geometry model, but also are useful inpractice by inspiring algorithmic development -- e.g., we show how simplealgorithmic changes, motivated by these toy models, can speed up the trainingof deep learning models.</description><author>Ziming Liu, Yizhou Liu, Eric J.

We train GPS-to-image models and use themfor tasks that require a fine-grained understanding of how images vary within acity. In particular, we train a diffusion model to generate images conditionedon both GPS and text. The learned model generates images that capture thedistinctive appearance of different neighborhoods, parks, and landmarks. Wealso extract 3D models from 2D GPS-to-image models through score distillationsampling, using GPS conditioning to constrain the appearance of thereconstruction from each viewpoint. Our evaluations suggest that ourGPS-conditioned models successfully learn to generate images that vary based onlocation, and that GPS conditioning improves estimated 3D structure.</description><author>Chao Feng, Ziyang Chen, Aleksander Holynski, Alexei A.

Our key innovation, Complete Teacher Forcing (CTF), conditionsmasked frames on complete observation frames rather than masked ones (namelyMasked Teacher Forcing, MTF), enabling a smooth transition from token-level(patch-level) to frame-level autoregressive generation. CTF significantlyoutperforms MTF, achieving a +23% improvement in FVD scores on first-frameconditioned video prediction. To address issues like exposure bias, we employtargeted training strategies, setting a new benchmark in autoregressive videogeneration. Experiments show that MAGI can generate long, coherent videosequences exceeding 100 frames, even when trained on as few as 16 frames,highlighting its potential for scalable, high-quality video generation.</description><author>Deyu Zhou, Quan Sun, Yuang Peng, Kun Yan, Runpei Dong, Duomin Wang, Zheng Ge, Nan Duan, Xiangyu Zhang, Lionel M.

Given a stream of images, thisevolving state can be used to generate metric-scale pointmaps (per-pixel 3Dpoints) for each new input in an online fashion. These pointmaps reside withina common coordinate system, and can be accumulated into a coherent, dense scenereconstruction that updates as new images arrive. Our model, called CUT3R(Continuous Updating Transformer for 3D Reconstruction), captures rich priorsof real-world scenes: not only can it predict accurate pointmaps from imageobservations, but it can also infer unseen regions of the scene by probing atvirtual, unobserved views. Our method is simple yet highly flexible, naturallyaccepting varying lengths of images that may be either video streams orunordered photo collections, containing both static and dynamic content. Weevaluate our method on various 3D/4D tasks and demonstrate competitive orstate-of-the-art performance in each.

In this paper, we propose an exemplar-basedanalogy model for audio texture manipulation. Instead of conditioning ontext-based instructions, our method uses paired speech examples, where one cliprepresents the original sound and another illustrates the desiredtransformation. The model learns to apply the same transformation to new input,allowing for the manipulation of sound textures. We construct a quadrupletdataset representing various editing tasks, and train a latent diffusion modelin a self-supervised manner. We show through quantitative evaluations andperceptual studies that our model outperforms text-conditioned baselines andgeneralizes to real-world, out-of-distribution, and non-speech scenarios.Project page: https://berkeley-speech-group.github.io/audio-texture-analogy/</description><author>Kan Jen Cheng, Tingle Li, Gopala Anumanchipalli</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:58:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12385v1</guid></item><item><title>CCESAR: Coastline Classification-Extraction From SAR Images Using CNN-U-Net Combination</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12384v1</link><description>In this article, we improve the deep learning solution for coastlineextraction from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images by proposing a two-stagemodel involving image classification followed by segmentation. We hypothesizethat a single segmentation model usually used for coastline detection isinsufficient to characterize different coastline types. We demonstrate that theneed for a two-stage workflow prevails through different compression levels ofthese images.

A common solution is to refine an established model with a qualityassessment system, which generally rates an image in its entirety. In thiswork, we believe problem-solving starts with identification, yielding therequest that the model should be aware of not just the presence of defects inan image, but their specific locations. Motivated by this, we proposeDiffDoctor, a two-stage pipeline to assist image diffusion models in generatingfewer artifacts. Concretely, the first stage targets developing a robustartifact detector, for which we collect a dataset of over 1M flawed synthesizedimages and set up an efficient human-in-the-loop annotation process,incorporating a carefully designed class-balance strategy. The learned artifactdetector is then involved in the second stage to tune the diffusion modelthrough assigning a per-pixel confidence map for each synthesis. Extensiveexperiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness ofour artifact detector as well as the soundness of our diagnose-then-treatdesign.</description><author>Yiyang Wang, Xi Chen, Xiaogang Xu, Sihui Ji, Yu Liu, Yujun Shen, Hengshuang Zhao</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:56:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12382v1</guid></item><item><title>Parallel Sequence Modeling via Generalized Spatial Propagation Network</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12381v1</link><description>We present the Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN), a newattention mechanism optimized for vision tasks that inherently captures 2Dspatial structures. Existing attention models, including transformers, linearattention, and state-space models like Mamba, process multi-dimensional data as1D sequences, compromising spatial coherence and efficiency. GSPN overcomesthese limitations by directly operating on spatially coherent image data andforming dense pairwise connections through a line-scan approach. Central toGSPN is the Stability-Context Condition, which ensures stable, context-awarepropagation across 2D sequences and reduces the effective sequence length to$\sqrt{N}$ for a square map with N elements, significantly enhancingcomputational efficiency. With learnable, input-dependent weights and noreliance on positional embeddings, GSPN achieves superior spatial fidelity andstate-of-the-art performance in vision tasks, including ImageNetclassification, class-guided image generation, and text-to-image generation.Notably, GSPN accelerates SD-XL with softmax-attention by over $84\times$ whengenerating 16K images.</description><author>Hongjun Wang, Wonmin Byeon, Jiarui Xu, Jinwei Gu, Ka Chun Cheung, Xiaolong Wang, Kai Han, Jan Kautz, Sifei Liu</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:56:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12381v1</guid></item><item><title>MMVU: Measuring Expert-Level Multi-Discipline Video Understanding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12380v1</link><description>We introduce MMVU, a comprehensive expert-level, multi-discipline benchmarkfor evaluating foundation models in video understanding. MMVU includes 3,000expert-annotated questions spanning 27 subjects across four core disciplines:Science, Healthcare, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, and Engineering. Compared toprior benchmarks, MMVU features three key advancements. First, it challengesmodels to apply domain-specific knowledge and perform expert-level reasoning toanalyze specialized-domain videos, moving beyond the basic visual perceptiontypically assessed in current video benchmarks. Second, each example isannotated by human experts from scratch. We implement strict data qualitycontrols to ensure the high quality of the dataset. Finally, each example isenriched with expert-annotated reasoning rationals and relevant domainknowledge, facilitating in-depth analysis. We conduct an extensive evaluationof 32 frontier multimodal foundation models on MMVU. The latestSystem-2-capable models, o1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, achieve the highestperformance among the tested models. However, they still fall short of matchinghuman expertise.

However, it suffers from temporalinconsistency in videos, hindering its practical applications. Various methodshave been proposed to alleviate this issue by leveraging video generationmodels or introducing priors from optical flow and camera poses. Nonetheless,these methods are only applicable to short videos (&lt; 10 seconds) and require atrade-off between quality and computational efficiency. We propose Video DepthAnything for high-quality, consistent depth estimation in super-long videos(over several minutes) without sacrificing efficiency. We base our model onDepth Anything V2 and replace its head with an efficient spatial-temporal head.We design a straightforward yet effective temporal consistency loss byconstraining the temporal depth gradient, eliminating the need for additionalgeometric priors. The model is trained on a joint dataset of video depth andunlabeled images, similar to Depth Anything V2. Moreover, a novelkey-frame-based strategy is developed for long video inference. Experimentsshow that our model can be applied to arbitrarily long videos withoutcompromising quality, consistency, or generalization ability. Comprehensiveevaluations on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate that our approach sets anew state-of-the-art in zero-shot video depth estimation.

Has AI already leveled the playing field between professionalartists and laypeople, or do trained artistic expressive capacity, curationskills and experience instead enhance the ability to use these new tools? Inthis pre-registered study, we conduct experimental comparisons between 50active artists and a demographically matched sample of laypeople. We designedtwo tasks to approximate artistic practice for testing their capabilities inboth faithful and creative image creation: replicating a reference image, andmoving as far away as possible from it. We developed a bespoke platform whereparticipants used a modern text-to-image model to complete both tasks. We alsocollected and compared participants' sentiments towards AI. On average, artistsproduced more faithful and creative outputs than their lay counterparts,although only by a small margin. While AI may ease content creation,professional expertise is still valuable - even within the confined space ofgenerative AI itself. Finally, we also explored how well an exemplaryvision-capable large language model (GPT-4o) would complete the same tasks, ifgiven the role of an image generation agent, and found it performed on par incopying but outperformed even artists in the creative task. The very bestresults were still produced by humans in both tasks. These outcomes highlightthe importance of integrating artistic skills with AI training to prepareartists and other visual professionals for a technologically evolvinglandscape. We see a potential in collaborative synergy with generative AI,which could reshape creative industries and education in the arts.</description><author>Thomas F.

Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities acrossa range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements inreasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened newavenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that thenatural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generationrequires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. Oneapproach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficientcontextual information. In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of theextended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google'sstate-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of variouscontextual information, including column example values, question and SQL querypairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window andextra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to bothaccuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do notget lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-contextNL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve a strongperformance with 67.41\% on BIRD benchmark (dev) without finetuning andexpensive self-consistency based techniques.</description><author>Yeounoh Chung, Gaurav T.

While scaling typically involvesincreasing both, the precise interplay between these factors and their combinedcontribution to overall capacity remains not fully understood. We explore thisrelationship in the context of sparse Mixture-of-Expert models (MoEs), whichallow scaling the number of parameters without proportionally increasing theFLOPs per example. We investigate how varying the sparsity level, i.e., theratio of non-active to total parameters, affects model performance in terms ofboth pretraining and downstream performance. We find that under differentconstraints (e.g. parameter size and total training compute), there is anoptimal level of sparsity that improves both training efficiency and modelperformance. These results provide a better understanding of the impact ofsparsity in scaling laws for MoEs and complement existing works in this area,offering insights for designing more efficient architectures.</description><author>Samira Abnar, Harshay Shah, Dan Busbridge, Alaaeldin Mohamed Elnouby Ali, Josh Susskind, Vimal Thilak</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:51:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12370v1</guid></item><item><title>DARB-Splatting: Generalizing Splatting with Decaying Anisotropic Radial Basis Functions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12369v1</link><description>Splatting-based 3D reconstruction methods have gained popularity with theadvent of 3D Gaussian Splatting, efficiently synthesizing high-quality novelviews. These methods commonly resort to using exponential family functions,such as the Gaussian function, as reconstruction kernels due to theiranisotropic nature, ease of projection, and differentiability in rasterization.However, the field remains restricted to variations within the exponentialfamily, leaving generalized reconstruction kernels largely underexplored,partly due to the lack of easy integrability in 3D to 2D projections. In thislight, we show that a class of decaying anisotropic radial basis functions(DARBFs), which are non-negative functions of the Mahalanobis distance,supports splatting by approximating the Gaussian function's closed-formintegration advantage. With this fresh perspective, we demonstrate up to 34%faster convergence during training and a 15% reduction in memory consumptionacross various DARB reconstruction kernels, while maintaining comparable PSNR,SSIM, and LPIPS results.

Whilereward models (RMs) with reinforcement learning or test-time scaling offer thepotential for improving generation quality, a critical gap remains: publiclyavailable multi-modal RMs for LVLMs are scarce, and the implementation detailsof proprietary models are often unclear. We bridge this gap withInternLM-XComposer2.5-Reward (IXC-2.5-Reward), a simple yet effectivemulti-modal reward model that aligns LVLMs with human preferences.

This work emphasizes the importance of integratingdecentralized spatio-temporal data into forecasting models. However,decentralized data ownership presents a critical obstacle to the success ofsuch spatio-temporal models, and incentive mechanisms to foster data-sharingneed to be considered. The main contributions are a) a comparative analysis ofthe forecasting models, advocating for efficient and interpretable spline LASSOregression models, and b) a bidding mechanism within the data/analytics marketto ensure fair compensation for data providers and enable both buyers andsellers to express their data price requirements. Furthermore, an incentivemechanism for time series forecasting is proposed, effectively incorporatingprice constraints and preventing redundant feature allocation.

Previousstudies have shown that, under the sparsity assumption, the Fourier transformcan be computed efficiently using fast and sample-efficient algorithms.However, in many practical settings, the function is defined over a moregeneral space -- the space of generalized $q$-ary sequences $\mathbb{Z}_{q_1}\times \mathbb{Z}_{q_2} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{q_n}$ -- where each$\mathbb{Z}_{q_i}$ corresponds to integers modulo $q_i$. A naive approachinvolves setting $q=\max_i{q_i}$ and treating the function as $q$-ary, whichresults in heavy computational overheads. Herein, we develop GFast, analgorithm that computes the $S$-sparse Fourier transform of $f$ with a samplecomplexity of $O(Sn)$, computational complexity of $O(Sn \log N)$, and afailure probability that approaches zero as $N=\prod_{i=1}^n q_i \rightarrow\infty$ with $S = N^\delta$ for some $0 \leq \delta &lt; 1$. In the presence ofnoise, we further demonstrate that a robust version of GFast computes thetransform with a sample complexity of $O(Sn^2)$ and computational complexity of$O(Sn^2 \log N)$ under the same high probability guarantees. Using large-scalesynthetic experiments, we demonstrate that GFast computes the sparse Fouriertransform of generalized $q$-ary functions using $16\times$ fewer samples andrunning $8\times$ faster than existing algorithms. In real-world proteinfitness datasets, GFast explains the predictive interactions of a neuralnetwork with $&gt;25\%$ smaller normalized mean-squared error compared to existingalgorithms.</description><author>Darin Tsui, Kunal Talreja, Amirali Aghazadeh</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:45:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12365v1</guid></item><item><title>The Choice of Normalization Influences Shrinkage in Regularized Regression</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03821v2</link><description>Regularized models are often sensitive to the scales of the features in thedata and it has therefore become standard practice to normalize (center andscale) the features before fitting the model. But there are many different waysto normalize the features and the choice may have dramatic effects on theresulting model. In spite of this, there has so far been no research on thistopic. In this paper, we begin to bridge this knowledge gap by studyingnormalization in the context of lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression. Wefocus on normal and binary features and show that the class balances of binaryfeatures directly influences the regression coefficients and that this effectdepends on the combination of normalization and regularization methods used. Wedemonstrate that this effect can be mitigated by scaling binary features withtheir variance in the case of the lasso and standard deviation in the case ofridge regression, but that this comes at the cost of increased variance. Forthe elastic net, we show that scaling the penalty weights, rather than thefeatures, can achieve the same effect. Finally, we also tackle mixes of binaryand normal features as well as interactions and provide some initial results onhow to normalize features in these cases.</description><author>Johan Larsson, Jonas Wallin</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:42:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03821v2</guid></item><item><title>Measured Hockey-Stick Divergence and its Applications to Quantum Pufferfish Privacy</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12359v1</link><description>The hockey-stick divergence is a fundamental quantity characterizing severalstatistical privacy frameworks that ensure privacy for classical and quantumdata. In such quantum privacy frameworks, the adversary is allowed to performall possible measurements. However, in practice, there are typicallylimitations to the set of measurements that can be performed. To this end,here, we comprehensively analyze the measured hockey-stick divergence underseveral classes of practically relevant measurement classes. We prove severalof its properties, including data processing and convexity. We show that it isefficiently computable by semi-definite programming for some classes ofmeasurements and can be analytically evaluated for Werner and isotropic states.Notably, we show that the measured hockey-stick divergence characterizesoptimal privacy parameters in the quantum pufferfish privacy framework. Withthis connection and the developed technical tools, we enable methods toquantify and audit privacy for several practically relevant settings. Lastly,we introduce the measured hockey-stick divergence of channels and explore itsapplications in ensuring privacy for channels.</description><author>Theshani Nuradha, Vishal Singh, Mark M.

However, the manual generation of unstructured medicalreports is time consuming and prone to errors. It creates a significantbottleneck in clinical workflows. Despite advancements in AI-generatedradiology reports, challenges remain in achieving detailed and accurate reportgeneration. In this study we have evaluated different combinations ofmultimodal models that integrate Computer Vision and Natural LanguageProcessing to generate comprehensive radiology reports. We employed apretrained Vision Transformer (ViT-B16) and a SWIN Transformer as the imageencoders. The BART and GPT-2 models serve as the textual decoders. We usedChest X-ray images and reports from the IU-Xray dataset to evaluate theusability of the SWIN Transformer-BART, SWIN Transformer-GPT-2, ViT-B16-BARTand ViT-B16-GPT-2 models for report generation. We aimed at finding the bestcombination among the models. The SWIN-BART model performs as thebest-performing model among the four models achieving remarkable results inalmost all the evaluation metrics like ROUGE, BLEU and BERTScore.</description><author>Md.

Censored regression models are ableto account for the effect of censoring due to the limited supply, but theydon't consider the effect of substitutions, which may cause the demand forsimilar alternative products or services to increase. This paper proposesDiffusion-aware Censored Demand Models, which combine a Tobit likelihood with agraph diffusion process in order to model the latent process of transfer ofunsatisfied demand between similar products or services. We instantiate thisnew class of models under the framework of GPs and, based on both simulated andreal-world data for modeling sales, bike-sharing demand, and EV chargingdemand, demonstrate its ability to better recover the true demand and producemore accurate out-of-sample predictions.</description><author>Filipe Rodrigues</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:33:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12354v1</guid></item><item><title>Test-time regression: a unifying framework for designing sequence models with associative memory</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12352v1</link><description>Sequences provide a remarkably general way to represent and processinformation. This powerful abstraction has placed sequence modeling at thecenter of modern deep learning applications, inspiring numerous architecturesfrom transformers to recurrent networks. While this fragmented development hasyielded powerful models, it has left us without a unified framework tounderstand their fundamental similarities and explain their effectiveness. Wepresent a unifying framework motivated by an empirical observation: effectivesequence models must be able to perform associative recall. Our key insight isthat memorizing input tokens through an associative memory is equivalent toperforming regression at test-time. This regression-memory correspondenceprovides a framework for deriving sequence models that can perform associativerecall, offering a systematic lens to understand seemingly ad-hoc architecturalchoices. We show numerous recent architectures -- including linear attentionmodels, their gated variants, state-space models, online learners, and softmaxattention -- emerge naturally as specific approaches to test-time regression.Each architecture corresponds to three design choices: the relative importanceof each association, the regressor function class, and the optimizationalgorithm. This connection leads to new understanding: we provide theoreticaljustification for QKNorm in softmax attention, and we motivate higher-ordergeneralizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work unlocksdecades of rich statistical tools that can guide future development of morepowerful yet principled sequence models.</description><author>Ke Alexander Wang, Jiaxin Shi, Emily B.

While the primary goal of CL is to maximize the expected accuracy gainfor each participant, it is also important to ensure that the gains are fairlydistributed. Specifically, no client should be negatively impacted by thecollaboration, and the individual gains must ideally be commensurate with thecontributions. Most existing CL algorithms require central coordination andfocus on the gain maximization objective while ignoring collaborative fairness.In this work, we first show that the existing measure of collaborative fairnessbased on the correlation between accuracy values without and with collaborationhas drawbacks because it does not account for negative collaboration gain. Weargue that maximizing mean collaboration gain (MCG) while simultaneouslyminimizing the collaboration gain spread (CGS) is a fairer alternative. Next,we propose the CYCle protocol that enables individual participants in a privatedecentralized learning (PDL) framework to achieve this objective through anovel reputation scoring method based on gradient alignment between the localcross-entropy and distillation losses. Experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,and Fed-ISIC2019 datasets empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of theCYCle protocol to ensure positive and fair collaboration gain for allparticipants, even in cases where the data distributions of participants arehighly skewed. For the simple mean estimation problem with two participants, wealso theoretically show that CYCle performs better than standard FedAvg,especially when there is large statistical heterogeneity.</description><author>Nurbek Tastan, Samuel Horvath, Karthik Nandakumar</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:22:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12344v1</guid></item><item><title>Bridging the Training-Inference Gap in LLMs by Leveraging Self-Generated Tokens</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14655v2</link><description>Language models are often trained to maximize the likelihood of the nexttoken given past tokens in the training dataset. However, during inferencetime, they are utilized differently, generating text sequentially andauto-regressively by using previously generated tokens as input to predict thenext one. Marginal differences in predictions at each step can cascade oversuccessive steps, resulting in different distributions from what the modelswere trained for and potentially leading to unpredictable behavior. This paperproposes two simple approaches based on model own generation to address thisdiscrepancy between the training and inference time. Our first approach isBatch-Scheduled Sampling, where, during training, we stochastically choosebetween the ground-truth token from the dataset and the model's own generatedtoken as input to predict the next token. This is done in an offline manner,modifying the context window by interleaving ground-truth tokens with thosegenerated by the model. Our second approach is Reference-Answer-basedCorrection, where we explicitly incorporate a self-correction capability intothe model during training. This enables the model to effectively self-correctthe gaps between the generated sequences and the ground truth data withoutrelying on an external oracle model. By incorporating our proposed strategiesduring training, we have observed an overall improvement in performancecompared to baseline methods, as demonstrated by our extensive experimentsusing summarization, general question-answering, and math question-answeringtasks.</description><author>Zhepeng Cen, Yao Liu, Siliang Zeng, Pratik Chaudhari, Huzefa Rangwala, George Karypis, Rasool Fakoor</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:14:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14655v2</guid></item><item><title>Treefix: Enabling Execution with a Tree of Prefixes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12339v1</link><description>The ability to execute code is a prerequisite for various dynamic programanalyses. Learning-guided execution has been proposed as an approach to enablethe execution of arbitrary code snippets by letting a neural model predictlikely values for any missing variables. Although state-of-the-artlearning-guided execution approaches, such as LExecutor, can enable theexecution of a relative high amount of code, they are limited to predicting arestricted set of possible values and do not use any feedback from previousexecutions to execute even more code. This paper presents Treefix, a novellearning-guided execution approach that leverages LLMs to iteratively createcode prefixes that enable the execution of a given code snippet. The approachaddresses the problem in a multi-step fashion, where each step uses feedbackabout the code snippet and its execution to instruct an LLM to improve apreviously generated prefix. This process iteratively creates a tree ofprefixes, a subset of which is returned to the user as prefixes that maximizethe number of executed lines in the code snippet. In our experiments with twodatasets of Python code snippets, Treefix achieves 25% and 7% more coveragerelative to the current state of the art in learning-guided execution, coveringa total of 84% and 82% of all lines in the code snippets.</description><author>Beatriz Souza, Michael Pradel</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:13:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12339v1</guid></item><item><title>FuocChuVIP123 at CoMeDi Shared Task: Disagreement Ranking with XLM-Roberta Sentence Embeddings and Deep Neural Regression</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12336v1</link><description>This paper presents results of our system for CoMeDi Shared Task, focusing onSubtask 2: Disagreement Ranking.

Recently LargeLanguage Models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, have shown great promises in labellingdata with high accuracy. However, privacy and cost concerns prevent theubiquitous use of GPT-4. In this work, we explore effectively leveragingopen-source models for automatic labelling. We identify integrating labelschema as a promising technology but found that naively using the labeldescription for classification leads to poor performance on high cardinalitytasks. To address this, we propose Retrieval Augmented Classification (RAC) forwhich LLM performs inferences for one label at a time using corresponding labelschema; we start with the most related label and iterates until a label ischosen by the LLM. We show that our method, which dynamically integrates labeldescription, leads to performance improvements in labelling tasks. We furthershow that by focusing only on the most promising labels, RAC can trade offbetween label quality and coverage - a property we leverage to automaticallylabel our internal datasets.</description><author>Thomas Walshe, Sae Young Moon, Chunyang Xiao, Yawwani Gunawardana, Fran Silavong</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:06:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12332v1</guid></item><item><title>$\spadesuit$ SPADE $\spadesuit$ Split Peak Attention DEcomposition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05852v2</link><description>Demand forecasting faces challenges induced by Peak Events (PEs)corresponding to special periods such as promotions and holidays.

Foundationmodels can overcome this limitation by analyzing entire images to captureglobal spatial relationships; however, they still encounter challenges stemmingfrom the weak labels associated with coarse pathology annotations in ultrasounddata. We introduce Cinepro, a novel framework that strengthens foundationmodels' ability to localize PCa in ultrasound cineloops. Cinepro adapts robusttraining by integrating the proportion of cancer tissue reported by pathologyin a biopsy core into its loss function to address label noise, providing amore nuanced supervision. Additionally, it leverages temporal data acrossmultiple frames to apply robust augmentations, enhancing the model's ability tolearn stable cancer-related features.

This bound, though never accuratelycharacterized, has been approached practically via deep learning technologiesin recent years. Indeed, learned image coding schemes allow direct optimizationof the joint rate-distortion cost, thereby outperforming the handcrafted imagecoding schemes by a large margin. Still, it is observed that there is room forfurther improvement in the rate-distortion performance of learned image coding.In this article, we identify the gap between the ideal rate-distortion functionforecasted by Shannon's information theory and the empirical rate-distortionfunction achieved by the state-of-the-art learned image coding schemes,revealing that the gap is incurred by five different effects: modeling effect,approximation effect, amortization effect, digitization effect, and asymptoticeffect. We design simulations and experiments to quantitively evaluate the lastthree effects, which demonstrates the high potential of future lossy imagecoding technologies.</description><author>Haotian Zhang, Dong Liu</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 17:59:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12330v1</guid></item><item><title>Beyond Position: the emergence of wavelet-like properties in Transformers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18067v3</link><description>This paper studies how transformer models develop robust wavelet-likeproperties that effectively compensate for the theoretical limitations ofRotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), providing insights into how these networksprocess sequential information across different scales.

To generate it weused BlanketGen2, our new and improved version of our BlanketGen pipeline thatsimulates synthetic blankets using ground-truth Skinned Multi-Person Linearmodel (SMPL) meshes and then renders them as transparent images that can belayered on top of the original frames. This dataset was used in combinationwith the original Fit3D to finetune the ViTPose-B HPE model, to evaluatesynthetic blanket augmentation effectiveness. The trained models were furtherevaluated on a real-world blanket occluded in-bed HPE dataset (SLP dataset).Comparing architectures trained on only Fit3D with the ones trained with oursynthetic blanket augmentation the later improved pose estimation performanceon BG2-Fit3D, the synthetic blanket occluded dataset significantly to (0.977Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK), 0.149 Normalized Mean Error (NME)) withan absolute 4.4% PCK increase. Furthermore, the test results on SLPdemonstrated the utility of synthetic data augmentation by improvingperformance by an absolute 2.3% PCK, on real-world images with the posesoccluded by real blankets. These results show synthetic blanket augmentationhas the potential to improve in-bed blanket occluded HPE from RGB images.

Methods: A set of 100 multiple-choice radiation oncology physics questions,previously created by a well-experienced physicist, was used for this study.The answer options of the questions were randomly shuffled to create "new" examsets. Five LLMs -- OpenAI o1-preview, GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro,and Claude 3.5 Sonnet -- with the versions released before September 30, 2024,were queried using these new exam sets. To evaluate their deductive reasoningability, the correct answer options in the questions were replaced with "Noneof the above." Then, the explain-first and step-by-step instruction promptswere used to test if this strategy improved their reasoning ability. Theperformance of the LLMs was compared with the answers from medical physicists. Results: All models demonstrated expert-level performance on these questions,with o1-preview even surpassing medical physicists with a majority vote. Whenreplacing the correct answer options with 'None of the above', all modelsexhibited a considerable decline in performance, suggesting room forimprovement. The explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompts helpedenhance the reasoning ability of the LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, andClaude 3.5 Sonnet models.

Our research focuses on modelling university subjects andlinking their topics to corresponding domain models, enabling the integrationof learning modules from different faculties and institutions in the student'slearning path.

We implement this model to create the KGfrom two study modules: Embedded Systems and Development of Embedded SystemsUsing FPGA. The resulting KG structures the curriculum and links it to thedomain models. We evaluate our approach through qualitative expert feedback andquantitative graph quality metrics. Domain experts validated the relevance andaccuracy of the model, while the graph quality metrics measured the structuralproperties of our KG.

However, training large, general GMMs becomes computationallyprohibitive for datasets with many data points $N$ of high-dimensionality $D$.For GMMs with arbitrary covariances, we here derive a highly efficientvariational approximation, which is integrated with mixtures of factoranalyzers (MFAs). For GMMs with $C$ components, our proposed algorithmsignificantly reduces runtime complexity per iteration from$\mathcal{O}(NCD^2)$ to a complexity scaling linearly with $D$ and remainingconstant w.r.t. $C$. Numerical validation of this theoretical complexityreduction then shows the following: the distance evaluations required for theentire GMM optimization process scale sublinearly with $NC$. On large-scalebenchmarks, this sublinearity results in speed-ups of an order-of-magnitudecompared to the state-of-the-art. As a proof of concept, we train GMMs withover 10 billion parameters on about 100 million images, and observe trainingtimes of approximately nine hours on a single state-of-the-art CPU.</description><author>Sebastian Salwig, Till Kahlke, Florian Hirschberger, Dennis Forster, Jörg Lücke</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 17:11:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12299v1</guid></item><item><title>RALAD: Bridging the Real-to-Sim Domain Gap in Autonomous Driving with Retrieval-Augmented Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12296v1</link><description>In the pursuit of robust autonomous driving systems, models trained onreal-world datasets often struggle to adapt to new environments, particularlywhen confronted with corner cases such as extreme weather conditions.Collecting these corner cases in the real world is non-trivial, whichnecessitates the use of simulators for validation. However,the highcomputational cost and the domain gap in data distribution have hindered theseamless transition between real and simulated driving scenarios. To tacklethis challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Learning for Autonomous Driving(RALAD), a novel framework designed to bridge the real-to-sim gap at a lowcost. RALAD features three primary designs, including (1) domain adaptation viaan enhanced Optimal Transport (OT) method that accounts for both individual andgrouped image distances, (2) a simple and unified framework that can be appliedto various models, and (3) efficient fine-tuning techniques that freeze thecomputationally expensive layers while maintaining robustness. Experimentalresults demonstrate that RALAD compensates for the performance degradation insimulated environments while maintaining accuracy in real-world scenariosacross three different models. Taking Cross View as an example, the mIOU andmAP metrics in real-world scenarios remain stable before and after RALADfine-tuning, while in simulated environments,the mIOU and mAP metrics areimproved by 10.30% and 12.29%, respectively. Moreover, the re-training cost ofour approach is reduced by approximately 88.1%.

The data associated with such scenarios arecharacteristically imbalanced, complicating binary classification owing to theoften-underestimated cost of misclassification during the classifier's learningprocess. Considering the high imbalance ratio (IR) of these datasets, weintroduce an innovative yet straightforward optimized activation function byincorporating an IR-dependent asymmetric adjusted factor embedded Sigmoidactivation function (ASIG). The embedding of ASIG makes the sensitive margin ofthe Sigmoid function auto-adjustable, depending on the imbalance nature of thedatasets distributed, thereby giving the activation function an asymmetriccharacteristic that prevents the underrepresentation of the minority class(positive samples) during the classifier's learning process. The experimentalresults show that the ASIG-embedded-classifier outperforms traditionalclassifiers on datasets across wide-ranging IRs in the downstreamcredit-scoring task. The algorithm also shows robustness and stability, evenwhen the IR is ultra-high. Therefore, the algorithm provides a competitivealternative in the financial industry, especially in credit scoring, possessingthe ability to effectively process highly imbalanced distribution data.</description><author>Xia Li, Hanghang Zheng, Kunpeng Tao, Mao Mao</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 16:54:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12285v1</guid></item><item><title>MoGERNN: An Inductive Traffic Predictor for Unobserved Locations in Dynamic Sensing Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12281v1</link><description>Given a partially observed road network, how can we predict the traffic stateof unobserved locations? While deep learning approaches show exceptionalperformance in traffic prediction, most assume sensors at all locations ofinterest, which is impractical due to financial constraints. Furthermore, thesemethods typically require costly retraining when sensor configurations change.We propose MoGERNN, an inductive spatio-temporal graph representation model, toaddress these challenges. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts approach in LargeLanguage Models, we introduce a Mixture of Graph Expert (MoGE) block to modelcomplex spatial dependencies through multiple graph message aggregators and asparse gating network. This block estimates initial states for unobservedlocations, which are then processed by a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder thatintegrates a graph message aggregator to capture spatio-temporal dependenciesand predict future states. Experiments on two real-world datasets show MoGERNNconsistently outperforms baseline methods for both observed and unobservedlocations. MoGERNN can accurately predict congestion evolution even in areaswithout sensors, offering valuable information for traffic management.Moreover, MoGERNN is adaptable to dynamic sensing networks, maintainingcompetitive performance even compared to its retrained counterpart. Tests withdifferent numbers of available sensors confirm its consistent superiority, andablation studies validate the effectiveness of its key modules.</description><author>Qishen Zhou, Yifan Zhang, Michail A.

This paperaims to address the problems of societal bias in CLIP. Although previousstudies have proposed to debias societal bias through adversarial learning ortest-time projecting, our comprehensive study of these works identifies twocritical limitations: 1) loss of attribute information when it is explicitlydisclosed in the input and 2) use of the attribute annotations during debiasingprocess. To mitigate societal bias in CLIP and overcome these limitationssimultaneously, we introduce a simple-yet-effective debiasing method calledSANER (societal attribute neutralizer) that eliminates attribute informationfrom CLIP text features only of attribute-neutral descriptions. Experimentalresults show that SANER, which does not require attribute annotations andpreserves original information for attribute-specific descriptions,demonstrates superior debiasing ability than the existing methods.Additionally, we observe that SANER does not require retraining CLIP fromscratch with the original dataset.

However, they would produce severeartifacts in the mask center when the masked area is too large and no pixelcorrespondences can be found for the center. Recently, diffusion models havedemonstrated impressive performance in generating diverse and high-qualityimages, and have been exploited in a number of works for image inpainting.These methods, however, cannot be applied directly to videos to producetemporal-coherent inpainting results. In this paper, we propose a training-freeframework, named VipDiff, for conditioning diffusion model on the reversediffusion process to produce temporal-coherent inpainting results withoutrequiring any training data or fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models.VipDiff takes optical flow as guidance to extract valid pixels from referenceframes to serve as constraints in optimizing the randomly sampled Gaussiannoise, and uses the generated results for further pixel propagation andconditional generation. VipDiff also allows for generating diverse videoinpainting results over different sampled noise. Experiments demonstrate thatVipDiff can largely outperform state-of-the-art video inpainting methods interms of both spatial-temporal coherence and fidelity.</description><author>Chaohao Xie, Kai Han, Kwan-Yee K.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle thelatter by constraining the final disease prediction on a set of predefined andhuman-interpretable concepts. However, the increased interpretability achievedthrough these concept-based explanations implies a higher annotation burden.Moreover, if a new concept needs to be added, the whole system needs to beretrained. Inspired by the remarkable performance shown by LargeVision-Language Models (LVLMs) in few-shot settings, we propose a simple, yeteffective, methodology, CBVLM, which tackles both of the aforementionedchallenges. First, for each concept, we prompt the LVLM to answer if theconcept is present in the input image. Then, we ask the LVLM to classify theimage based on the previous concept predictions. Moreover, in both stages, weincorporate a retrieval module responsible for selecting the best examples forin-context learning. By grounding the final diagnosis on the predictedconcepts, we ensure explainability, and by leveraging the few-shot capabilitiesof LVLMs, we drastically lower the annotation cost. We validate our approachwith extensive experiments across four medical datasets and twelve LVLMs (bothgeneric and medical) and show that CBVLM consistently outperforms CBMs andtask-specific supervised methods without requiring any training and using justa few annotated examples.

However, thesubstantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effectivecompression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of thepoint cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges forcompression. To achieve a compact size, we propose HAC++, which leverages therelationships between unorganized anchors and a structured hash grid, utilizingtheir mutual information for context modeling. Additionally, HAC++ capturesintra-anchor contextual relationships to further enhance compressionperformance. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions toprecisely estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where anadaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantizationof these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Moreover, we incorporatean adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors.Overall, HAC++ achieves a remarkable size reduction of over 100X compared tovanilla 3DGS when averaged on all datasets, while simultaneously improvingfidelity. It also delivers more than 20X size reduction compared toScaffold-GS.

Towards exploring a more realistic learning substrate, we investigatestreaming self-supervised learning from long-form real-world egocentric videostreams. Inspired by the event segmentation mechanism in human perception andmemory, we propose "Memory Storyboard" that groups recent past frames intotemporal segments for more effective summarization of the past visual streamsfor memory replay. To accommodate efficient temporal segmentation, we propose atwo-tier memory hierarchy: the recent past is stored in a short-term memory,and the storyboard temporal segments are then transferred to a long-termmemory. Experiments on real-world egocentric video datasets including SAYCamand KrishnaCam show that contrastive learning objectives on top of storyboardframes result in semantically meaningful representations which outperform thoseproduced by state-of-the-art unsupervised continual learning methods.</description><author>Yanlai Yang, Mengye Ren</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 16:19:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12254v1</guid></item><item><title>Hire Me or Not?

A known issue of models trained onnatural language data is the presence of human biases, which can impact thefairness of the system. This paper investigates LLMs' behavior with respect togender stereotypes, in the context of occupation decision making. Our frameworkis designed to investigate and quantify the presence of gender stereotypes inLLMs' behavior via multi-round question answering. Inspired by prior works, weconstruct a dataset by leveraging a standard occupation classificationknowledge base released by authoritative agencies. We tested three LLMs(RoBERTa-large, GPT-3.5-turbo, and Llama2-70b-chat) and found that all modelsexhibit gender stereotypes analogous to human biases, but with differentpreferences. The distinct preferences of GPT-3.5-turbo and Llama2-70b-chat mayimply the current alignment methods are insufficient for debiasing and couldintroduce new biases contradicting the traditional gender stereotypes.</description><author>Damin Zhang, Yi Zhang, Geetanjali Bihani, Julia Rayz</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 16:15:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06687v3</guid></item><item><title>Untrained Perceptual Loss for image denoising of line-like structures in MR images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05884v2</link><description>In the acquisition of Magnetic Resonance (MR) images shorter scan times leadto higher image noise. Therefore, automatic image denoising using deep learningmethods is of high interest. MR images containing line-like structures such asroots or vessels yield special characteristics as they display connectedstructures and yield sparse information. For this kind of data, it is importantto consider voxel neighborhoods when training a denoising network. In thispaper, we translate the Perceptual Loss to 3D data by comparing feature maps ofuntrained networks in the loss function as done previously for 2D data. Wetested the performance of untrained Perceptual Loss (uPL) on 3D image denoisingof MR images displaying brain vessels (MR angiograms - MRA) and images of plantroots in soil. We investigate the impact of various uPL characteristics such asweight initialization, network depth, kernel size, and pooling operations onthe results. We tested the performance of the uPL loss on four Rician noiselevels using evaluation metrics such as the Structural Similarity Index Metric(SSIM). We observe, that our uPL outperforms conventional loss functions suchas the L1 loss or a loss based on the Structural Similarity Index Metric(SSIM). The uPL network's initialization is not important, while network depthand pooling operations impact denoising performance. E.g. for both datasets anetwork with five convolutional layers led to the best performance while anetwork with more layers led to a performance drop. We also find that small uPLnetworks led to better or comparable results than using large networks such asVGG. We observe superior performance of our loss for both datasets, all noiselevels, and three network architectures. In conclusion, for images containingline-like structures, uPL is an alternative to other loss functions for 3Dimage denoising.</description><author>Elisabeth Pfaehler, Daniel Pflugfelder, Hanno Scharr</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 16:11:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05884v2</guid></item><item><title>Video Deblurring by Sharpness Prior Detection and Edge Information</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12246v1</link><description>Video deblurring is essential task for autonomous driving, facialrecognition, and security surveillance. Traditional methods directly estimatemotion blur kernels, often introducing artifacts and leading to poor results.Recent approaches utilize the detection of sharp frames within video sequencesto enhance deblurring. However, existing datasets rely on fixed number of sharpframes, which may be too restrictive for some applications and may introduce abias during model training. To address these limitations and enhance domainadaptability, this work first introduces GoPro Random Sharp (GoProRS), a newdataset where the the frequency of sharp frames within the sequence iscustomizable, allowing more diverse training and testing scenarios.Furthermore, it presents a novel video deblurring model, called SPEINet, thatintegrates sharp frame features into blurry frame reconstruction through anattention-based encoder-decoder architecture, a lightweight yet robust sharpframe detection and an edge extraction phase. Extensive experimental resultsdemonstrate that SPEINet outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multipledatasets, achieving an average of +3.2% PSNR improvement over recenttechniques.

However, even with accurate and relevant retrievedcontent, RAG models can still produce hallucinations by generating outputs thatconflict with the retrieved information. Detecting such hallucinations requiresdisentangling how Large Language Models (LLMs) utilize external and parametricknowledge. Current detection methods often focus on one of these mechanisms orwithout decoupling their intertwined effects, making accurate detectiondifficult. In this paper, we investigate the internal mechanisms behindhallucinations in RAG scenarios. We discover hallucinations occur when theKnowledge FFNs in LLMs overemphasize parametric knowledge in the residualstream, while Copying Heads fail to effectively retain or integrate externalknowledge from retrieved content. Based on these findings, we propose ReDeEP, anovel method that detects hallucinations by decoupling LLM's utilization ofexternal context and parametric knowledge. Our experiments show that ReDeEPsignificantly improves RAG hallucination detection accuracy.

However, inthe common practice, inconsistency in the initial presentation of X-ray imagesis a common complaint by radiologists. Different patient positions, patienthabitus and scanning protocols can lead to differences in image presentations,e.g., differences in brightness and contrast globally or regionally. Tocompensate for this, additional work will be executed by clinical experts toadjust the images to the desired presentation, which can be time-consuming.Existing deep-learning-based end-to-end solutions can automatically correctimages with promising performances. Nevertheless, these methods are hard to beinterpreted and difficult to be understood by clinical experts. In thismanuscript, a novel interpretable mapping method by deep learning is proposed,which automatically enhances the image brightness and contrast globally andlocally. Meanwhile, because the model is inspired by the workflow of thebrightness and contrast manipulation, it can provide interpretable pixel mapsfor explaining the motivation of image enhancement.

Based on the documented success of Adam, learning ratedecay, and weight decay, we hypothesize that the pre-training loss landscapefeatures a narrowing valley structure. Through experiments with synthetic lossfunctions, we discover that when gradient query noise is high relative to thevalley's sharpness, Adam's performance falls behind that of Signum because Adamreduces the effective step size too drastically. This observation led us todevelop FOCUS, an optimizer that enhances Signum by incorporating attractiontoward moving averaged parameters, allowing it to handle noise better whilemaintaining larger step sizes. In training GPT-2, FOCUS proves to be morestable than Signum and faster than Adam.

While many vision tasks benefit from pre-trainedfeature backbones to improve generalizability, point tracking has primarilyrelied on simpler backbones trained from scratch on synthetic data, which maylimit robustness in real-world scenarios. Additionally, point tracking requirestemporal awareness to ensure coherence across frames, but usingtemporally-aware features is still underexplored. Most current methods oftenemploy a two-stage process: an initial coarse prediction followed by arefinement stage to inject temporal information and correct errors from thecoarse stage. These approach, however, is computationally expensive andpotentially redundant if the feature backbone itself captures sufficienttemporal information. In this work, we introduce Chrono, a feature backbone specifically designedfor point tracking with built-in temporal awareness. Leveraging pre-trainedrepresentations from self-supervised learner DINOv2 and enhanced with atemporal adapter, Chrono effectively captures long-term temporal context,enabling precise prediction even without the refinement stage. Experimentalresults demonstrate that Chrono achieves state-of-the-art performance in arefiner-free setting on the TAP-Vid-DAVIS and TAP-Vid-Kinetics datasets, amongcommon feature backbones used in point tracking as well as DINOv2, withexceptional efficiency.

Our approach not only preserves strong vision-languagecapacity, but also enables efficient speech-to-speech dialogue capabilitieswithout separate ASR and TTS modules, significantly accelerating multimodalend-to-end response speed. By comparing our method against state-of-the-artcounterparts across benchmarks for image, video, and speech tasks, wedemonstrate that our model is equipped with both strong visual and speechcapabilities, making near real-time vision and speech interaction.</description><author>Chaoyou Fu, Haojia Lin, Xiong Wang, Yi-Fan Zhang, Yunhang Shen, Xiaoyu Liu, Haoyu Cao, Zuwei Long, Heting Gao, Ke Li, Long Ma, Xiawu Zheng, Rongrong Ji, Xing Sun, Caifeng Shan, Ran He</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 15:36:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01957v3</guid></item><item><title>RL-RC-DoT: A Block-level RL agent for Task-Aware Video Compression</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12216v1</link><description>Video encoders optimize compression for human perception by minimizingreconstruction error under bit-rate constraints. In many modern applicationssuch as autonomous driving, an overwhelming majority of videos serve as inputfor AI systems performing tasks like object recognition or segmentation, ratherthan being watched by humans. It is therefore useful to optimize the encoderfor a downstream task instead of for perceptual image quality. However, a majorchallenge is how to combine such downstream optimization with existing standardvideo encoders, which are highly efficient and popular. Here, we address thischallenge by controlling the Quantization Parameters (QPs) at the macro-blocklevel to optimize the downstream task. This granular control allows us toprioritize encoding for task-relevant regions within each frame. We formulatethis optimization problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) task, where theagent learns to balance long-term implications of choosing QPs on both taskperformance and bit-rate constraints. Notably, our policy does not require thedownstream task as an input during inference, making it suitable for streamingapplications and edge devices such as vehicles. We demonstrate significantimprovements in two tasks, car detection, and ROI (saliency) encoding. Ourapproach improves task performance for a given bit rate compared to traditionaltask agnostic encoding methods, paving the way for more efficient task-awarevideo compression.</description><author>Uri Gadot, Assaf Shocher, Shie Mannor, Gal Chechik, Assaf Hallak</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 15:36:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12216v1</guid></item><item><title>Automatic selection of the best neural architecture for time series forecasting via multi-objective optimization and Pareto optimality conditions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12215v1</link><description>Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in a wide range of applications,including weather prediction, healthcare, structural health monitoring,predictive maintenance, energy systems, and financial markets. While modelssuch as LSTM, GRU, Transformers, and State-Space Models (SSMs) have becomestandard tools in this domain, selecting the optimal architecture remains achallenge. Performance comparisons often depend on evaluation metrics and thedatasets under analysis, making the choice of a universally optimal modelcontroversial. In this work, we introduce a flexible automated framework fortime series forecasting that systematically designs and evaluates diversenetwork architectures by integrating LSTM, GRU, multi-head Attention, and SSMblocks. Using a multi-objective optimization approach, our framework determinesthe number, sequence, and combination of blocks to align with specificrequirements and evaluation objectives. From the resulting Pareto-optimalarchitectures, the best model for a given context is selected via auser-defined preference function. We validate our framework across fourdistinct real-world applications. Results show that a single-layer GRU or LSTMis usually optimal when minimizing training time alone. However, whenmaximizing accuracy or balancing multiple objectives, the best architecturesare often composite designs incorporating multiple block types in specificconfigurations. By employing a weighted preference function, users can resolvetrade-offs between objectives, revealing novel, context-specific optimalarchitectures. Our findings underscore that no single neural architecture isuniversally optimal for time series forecasting. Instead, the best-performingmodel emerges as a data-driven composite architecture tailored to user-definedcriteria and evaluation objectives.</description><author>Qianying Cao, Shanqing Liu, Alan John Varghese, Jerome Darbon, Michael Triantafyllou, George Em Karniadakis</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 15:33:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12215v1</guid></item><item><title>Quantitative Error Bounds for Scaling Limits of Stochastic Iterative Algorithms</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12212v1</link><description>Stochastic iterative algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD)and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), are widely utilized foroptimization and sampling in large-scale and high-dimensional problems inmachine learning, statistics, and engineering. Numerous works have bounded theparameter error in, and characterized the uncertainty of, these approximations.One common approach has been to use scaling limit analyses to relate thedistribution of algorithm sample paths to a continuous-time stochastic processapproximation, particularly in asymptotic setups. Focusing on the univariatesetting, in this paper, we build on previous work to derive non-asymptoticfunctional approximation error bounds between the algorithm sample paths andthe Ornstein-Uhlenbeck approximation using an infinite-dimensional version ofStein's method of exchangeable pairs. We show that this bound implies weakconvergence under modest additional assumptions and leads to a bound on theerror of the variance of the iterate averages of the algorithm. Furthermore, weuse our main result to construct error bounds in terms of two common metrics:the L\'{e}vy-Prokhorov and bounded Wasserstein distances. Our results provide afoundation for developing similar error bounds for the multivariate setting andfor more sophisticated stochastic approximation algorithms.</description><author>Xiaoyu Wang, Mikolaj J.

Our workinvestigates this phenomenon by analyzing attention patterns across transformerlayers and heads, revealing that hallucinations often stem from progressivedegradation of visual grounding in deeper layers. We propose a novel attentionmodification approach that combines selective token emphasis and head-specificmodulation to maintain visual grounding throughout the generation process. Ourmethod introduces two key components: (1) a dual-stream token selectionmechanism that identifies and prioritizes both locally informative andspatially significant visual tokens, and (2) an attention head-specificmodulation strategy that differentially amplifies visual information processingbased on measured visual sensitivity of individual attention heads. Throughextensive experimentation on the MSCOCO dataset, we demonstrate that ourapproach reduces hallucination rates by up to 62.3\% compared to baselinemodels while maintaining comparable task performance.

The advent of foundation models, characterized bytheir extensive generalization capabilities and emergent uses, has furthercomplicated this landscape. Foundation models occupy an ambiguous position inthe explainability domain: their complexity makes them inherently challengingto interpret, yet they are increasingly leveraged as tools to constructexplainable models. In this survey, we explore the intersection of foundationmodels and eXplainable AI (XAI) in the vision domain. We begin by compiling acomprehensive corpus of papers that bridge these fields.

Multiple heads intuitivelyenable different parallel processes over the same input. Yet, they also obscurethe attribution of each input patch to the output of a model. We propose anovel 1-head Transformer Attention Bottleneck (TAB) layer, inserted after thetraditional MHSA architecture, to serve as an attention bottleneck forinterpretability and intervention. Unlike standard self-attention, TABconstrains the total attention over all patches to $\in [0, 1]$. That is, whenthe total attention is 0, no visual information is propagated further into thenetwork and the vision-language model (VLM) would default to a generic,image-independent response. To demonstrate the advantages of TAB, we train VLMswith TAB to perform image difference captioning. Over three datasets, ourmodels perform similarly to baseline VLMs in captioning but the bottleneck issuperior in localizing changes and in identifying when no changes occur. TAB isthe first architecture to enable users to intervene by editing attention, whichoften produces expected outputs by VLMs.</description><author>Pooyan Rahmanzadehgervi, Hung Huy Nguyen, Rosanne Liu, Long Mai, Anh Totti Nguyen</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 15:16:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18675v3</guid></item><item><title>Hunyuan3D 2.0: Scaling Diffusion Models for High Resolution Textured 3D Assets Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12202v1</link><description>We present Hunyuan3D 2.0, an advanced large-scale 3D synthesis system forgenerating high-resolution textured 3D assets.

However, they exhibit the oppositebehavior in other settings, which poses the problem of finding alternatives toensure convergence.

However, CE-trained deep neural networksstruggle with robustness and generalisation issues. To alleviate these issues,we propose high error margin (HEM) loss, a variant of multi-class margin lossthat overcomes the training issues of other margin-based losses. We evaluateHEM extensively on a range of architectures and datasets. We find that HEM lossis more effective than cross-entropy loss across a wide range of tasks: unknownclass rejection, adversarial robustness, learning with imbalanced data,continual learning, and semantic segmentation (a pixel-level classificationtask). Despite all training hyper-parameters being chosen for CE loss, HEM isinferior to CE only in terms of clean accuracy and this difference isinsignificant. We also compare HEM to specialised losses that have previouslybeen proposed to improve performance on specific tasks. LogitNorm, a lossachieving state-of-the-art performance on unknown class rejection, producessimilar performance to HEM for this task, but is much poorer for continuallearning and semantic segmentation. Logit-adjusted loss, designed forimbalanced data, has superior results to HEM for that task, but performs morepoorly on unknown class rejection and semantic segmentation. DICE, a popularloss for semantic segmentation, is inferior to HEM loss on all tasks, includingsemantic segmentation. Thus, HEM often out-performs specialised losses, and incontrast to them, is a general-purpose replacement for CE loss.</description><author>Michael W. Spratling, Heiko H.

We developed a model-free RLHF best policy identification algorithm,called $\mathsf{BSAD}$, without explicit reward model inference, which is acritical intermediate step in the contemporary RLHF paradigms for traininglarge language models (LLM). The algorithm identifies the optimal policydirectly from human preference information in a backward manner, employing adueling bandit sub-routine that constantly duels actions to identify thesuperior one. $\mathsf{BSAD}$ adopts a reward-free exploration andbest-arm-identification-like adaptive stopping criteria to equalize thevisitation among all states in the same decision step while moving to theprevious step as soon as the optimal action is identifiable, leading to aprovable, instance-dependent sample complexity$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(c_{\mathcal{M}}SA^3H^3M\log\frac{1}{\delta})$ whichresembles the result in classic RL, where $c_{\mathcal{M}}$ is theinstance-dependent constant and $M$ is the batch size. Moreover,$\mathsf{BSAD}$ can be transformed into an explore-then-commit algorithm withlogarithmic regret and generalized to discounted MDPs using a frame-basedapproach.

Toalleviate this problem, we introduce COmoving Computer Acceleration (COCA), ahybrid framework interfacing ML with an $N$-body simulator. The correctphysical equations of motion are solved in an emulated frame of reference, sothat any emulation error is corrected by design. This approach corresponds tosolving for the perturbation of particle trajectories around the machine-learntsolution, which is computationally cheaper than obtaining the full solution,yet is guaranteed to converge to the truth as one increases the number of forceevaluations. Although applicable to any ML algorithm and $N$-body simulator,this approach is assessed in the particular case of particle-mesh cosmologicalsimulations in a frame of reference predicted by a convolutional neuralnetwork, where the time dependence is encoded as an additional input parameterto the network. COCA efficiently reduces emulation errors in particletrajectories, requiring far fewer force evaluations than running thecorresponding simulation without ML. We obtain accurate final density andvelocity fields for a reduced computational budget. We demonstrate that thismethod shows robustness when applied to examples outside the range of thetraining data.

This comparison has yielded some interesting results and insightsabout the strengths and weaknesses of the participating models. Furthermore, weattempted various ways to fine-tune the ShareGPT4V model for this specifictask, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results in this particular challenge.Although such a model would not be practical in production, as it is incrediblyexpensive compared to a specialized model like MiVOLO, it could be very usefulin some tasks, like data annotation.</description><author>Maksim Kuprashevich, Grigorii Alekseenko, Irina Tolstykh</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 14:50:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02302v4</guid></item></channel></rss>

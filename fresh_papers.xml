To address this, we present Vista3D,a framework that realizes swift and consistent 3D generation within a mere 5minutes. At the heart of Vista3D lies a two-phase approach: the coarse phaseand the fine phase. In the coarse phase, we rapidly generate initial geometrywith Gaussian Splatting from a single image. In the fine phase, we extract aSigned Distance Function (SDF) directly from learned Gaussian Splatting,optimizing it with a differentiable isosurface representation. Furthermore, itelevates the quality of generation by using a disentangled representation withtwo independent implicit functions to capture both visible and obscured aspectsof objects. Additionally, it harmonizes gradients from 2D diffusion prior with3D-aware diffusion priors by angular diffusion prior composition. Throughextensive evaluation, we demonstrate that Vista3D effectively sustains abalance between the consistency and diversity of the generated 3D objects.Demos and code will be available at https://github.com/florinshen/Vista3D.</description><author>Qiuhong Shen, Xingyi Yang, Michael Bi Mi, Xinchao Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 17:59:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12193v1</guid></item><item><title>DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12192v1</link><description>Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complexvisuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds tothousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visualobservations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visualrepresentations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data ortrained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we presentDynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visualrepresentations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn alatent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence ofimage embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, withoutaugmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internetdatasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and realenvironments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantlyimprove downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervisedlearning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMohold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo andmeasure its impact on downstream policy performance.

Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutionsinto different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model togenerate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligningwith human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal RotaryPosition Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positionalinformation across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm forprocessing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perceptioncapabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VLinvestigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Byscaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and theamount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitiveperformance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable toleading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodalbenchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

BA optimizes parameters such as camera posesand 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importanceof deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need tointegrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability andperformance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning librarieslike PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease ofdebugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, weintroduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,providing PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approachincludes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linearsolvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,achieving an average speedup of 18.5$\times$, 22$\times$, and 23$\times$compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.</description><author>Zitong Zhan, Huan Xu, Zihang Fang, Xinpeng Wei, Yaoyu Hu, Chen Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 17:59:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12190v1</guid></item><item><title>Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12189v1</link><description>Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity ofhuman behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the inputsequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearbypeople can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware socialtransformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widelyvarying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporalconvolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneckthat allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We modelthe conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. Webenchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our modeloutperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on differentmetrics and in a user study.

This series includes two models:Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. As a code-specific model,Qwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrainedon a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coderdemonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining generalversatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code-relatedtasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believethat the release of the Qwen2.5-Coder series will not only push the boundariesof research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,encourage broader adoption by developers in real-world applications.</description><author>Binyuan Hui, Jian Yang, Zeyu Cui, Jiaxi Yang, Dayiheng Liu, Lei Zhang, Tianyu Liu, Jiajun Zhang, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Rui Men, Fei Huang, Xingzhang Ren, Xuancheng Ren, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 17:57:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12186v1</guid></item><item><title>LaMamba-Diff: Linear-Time High-Fidelity Diffusion Models Based on Local Attention and Mamba</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02615v2</link><description>Recent Transformer-based diffusion models have shown remarkable performance,largely attributed to the ability of the self-attention mechanism to accuratelycapture both global and local contexts by computing all-pair interactions amonginput tokens. However, their quadratic complexity poses significantcomputational challenges for long-sequence inputs. Conversely, a recent statespace model called Mamba offers linear complexity by compressing a filteredglobal context into a hidden state. Despite its efficiency, compressioninevitably leads to information loss of fine-grained local dependencies amongtokens, which are crucial for effective visual generative modeling. Motivatedby these observations, we introduce Local Attentional Mamba (LaMamba) blocksthat combine the strengths of self-attention and Mamba, capturing both globalcontexts and local details with linear complexity. Leveraging the efficientU-Net architecture, our model exhibits exceptional scalability and surpassesthe performance of DiT across various model scales on ImageNet at 256x256resolution, all while utilizing substantially fewer GFLOPs and a comparablenumber of parameters. Compared to state-of-the-art diffusion models on ImageNet256x256 and 512x512, our largest model presents notable advantages, such as areduction of up to 62% GFLOPs compared to DiT-XL/2, while achieving superiorperformance with comparable or fewer parameters.</description><author>Yunxiang Fu, Chaoqi Chen, Yizhou Yu</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 17:55:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02615v2</guid></item><item><title>To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1</link><description>Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for elicitingreasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds oftasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducteda quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our ownevaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT givesstrong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, withmuch smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating theanswer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless thequestion or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolicoperations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior ofCoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparingagainst tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolicexecution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Ourresults indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performancewhile saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyondprompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computationacross the whole range of LLM applications.</description><author>Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 17:55:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1</guid></item><item><title>A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12181v1</link><description>Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language modelsthat utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challengesassociated with directly training long-context models, many methods have beenproposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing todifferences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare theseapproaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-contextperformance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement acontrolled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields severalinsights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role ofperplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-contexttasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methodssystematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm thatexact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range oftheir extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases,models, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promotingtransparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AIdevelopment.</description><author>Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T.

Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generateinformation that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive stylecan make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,end-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs withthe accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in alloutputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we exploresupervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method todevelop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and thenfine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions ofuncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, wedemonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, andsupervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads towell-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claimanswers.</description><author>Arslan Chaudhry, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Dilan Gorur</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 17:52:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180v1</guid></item><item><title>AnySkin: Plug-and-play Skin Sensing for Robotic Touch</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08276v2</link><description>While tactile sensing is widely accepted as an important and useful sensingmodality, its use pales in comparison to other sensory modalities like visionand proprioception. AnySkin addresses the critical challenges that impede theuse of tactile sensing -- versatility, replaceability, and data reusability.Building on the simplistic design of ReSkin, and decoupling the sensingelectronics from the sensing interface, AnySkin simplifies integration makingit as straightforward as putting on a phone case and connecting a charger.Furthermore, AnySkin is the first uncalibrated tactile-sensor withcross-instance generalizability of learned manipulation policies. To summarize,this work makes three key contributions: first, we introduce a streamlinedfabrication process and a design tool for creating an adhesive-free, durableand easily replaceable magnetic tactile sensor; second, we characterize slipdetection and policy learning with the AnySkin sensor; and third, wedemonstrate zero-shot generalization of models trained on one instance ofAnySkin to new instances, and compare it with popular existing tactilesolutions like DIGIT and ReSkin.https://any-skin.github.io/</description><author>Raunaq Bhirangi, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Enes Erciyes, Yifeng Cao, Tess Hellebrekers, Lerrel Pinto</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 17:52:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08276v2</guid></item><item><title>Computational Dynamical Systems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179v1</link><description>We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensionaldynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for whatit means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We thenshow that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems)cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines canbe robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, weshow that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stableone-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, andmoreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulateanother, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the systembeing simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamicalsystem leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexitytheory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.</description><author>Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 17:51:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179v1</guid></item><item><title>UKAN: Unbound Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Accompanied with Accelerated Library</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11200v2</link><description>In this work, we present a GPU-accelerated library for the underlyingcomponents of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), along with an algorithm toeliminate bounded grids in KANs. The GPU-accelerated library reduces thecomputational complexity of Basis Spline (B-spline) evaluation by a factor of$\mathcal{O}$(grid size) compared to existing codes, enabling batch computationfor large-scale learning. To overcome the limitations of traditional KANs, weintroduce Unbounded KANs (UKANs), which eliminate the need for a bounded gridand a fixed number of B-spline coefficients. To do so, we replace the KANparameters (B-spline coefficients) with a coefficient generator (CG) model. Theinputs to the CG model are designed based on the idea of an infinite symmetricgrid extending from negative infinity to positive infinity. The positionalencoding of grid group, a sequential collection of B-spline grid indexes, isfed into the CG model, and coefficients are consumed by the efficientimplementation (matrix representations) of B-spline functions to generateoutputs. We perform several experiments on regression, classification, andgenerative tasks, which are promising. In particular, UKAN does not requiredata normalization or a bounded domain for evaluation. Additionally, ourbenchmarking results indicate the superior memory and computational efficiencyof our library compared to existing codes.</description><author>Alireza Moradzadeh, Lukasz Wawrzyniak, Miles Macklin, Saee G.

However,due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity acrossdifferent MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. Inthis study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,which integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modalimaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumorcharacteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, anAdaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale featuredecoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separatelyextract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF modulefuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wiseattention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines bothcommon and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations onthe BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority ofmultiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistentlyachieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our resultsalso indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precisionand recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents asignificant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improvingclinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.</description><author>Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 17:35:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1</guid></item><item><title>ReflectDiffu:Reflect between Emotion-intent Contagion and Mimicry for Empathetic Response Generation via a RL-Diffusion Framework</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10289v2</link><description>Empathetic response generation necessitates the integration of emotional andintentional dynamics to foster meaningful interactions.

Hence, real-time forecasting of solar irradiance forgrid-connected photovoltaic systems is necessary to schedule and allocateresources across the grid. Ground-based imagers that capture wide field-of-viewimages of the sky are commonly used to monitor cloud movement around aparticular site in an effort to forecast solar irradiance. However, these wideFOV imagers capture a distorted image of sky image, where regions near thehorizon are heavily compressed. This hinders the ability to precisely predictcloud motion near the horizon which especially affects prediction over longertime horizons. In this work, we combat the aforementioned constraint byintroducing a deep learning method to predict a future sky image frame withhigher resolution than previous methods. Our main contribution is to derive anoptimal warping method to counter the adverse affects of clouds at the horizon,and learn a framework for future sky image prediction which better determinescloud evolution for longer time horizons.</description><author>Leron Julian, Aswin C.

Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speakeridentity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address thesechallenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network onmonocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learndisentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audiofeatures in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learnedaudio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the musclemotion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecturethat learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions anddisentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Throughquantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method cansynthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facialexpression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.</description><author>Sai Tanmay Reddy Chakkera, Aggelina Chatziagapi, Dimitris Samaras</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 17:18:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12156v1</guid></item><item><title>Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet for lesion segmentation in PET/CT</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12155v1</link><description>Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumorcharacterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhancesdiagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation oflesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given therising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,particularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly morerelevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentationof tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizablesolutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPETchallenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed aclassifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the MaximumIntensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individualnnUNet-ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as amulti-label task to enhance the model's performance. Our final submissionachieves cross-validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publiclyavailable FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively.

This paperpresents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of largelanguage models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their "black box" and staticnature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the itemvisual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with aMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract styleand color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basisfor personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on theopen-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its abilityto recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negativeexamples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This createsa self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations inline with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvoredataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework'sability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuouslyimproving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that ourproposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating morecohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores theproposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accuratesuggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfitgeneration.</description><author>Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 17:15:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1</guid></item><item><title>MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for Reasoning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1</link><description>Large Language Models' (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test-timeaggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting amonggenerated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach asaturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generatedfeedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 keychallenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances canover-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize andaddress errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle toidentify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Decidinghow many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping toosoon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we proposeMAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficultyas easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hardones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve errorlocalization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop withthree agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based onstep-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensuresufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiatingfurther rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration ofMAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement withbaselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, ourablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agentcommunication.</description><author>Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 17:12:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1</guid></item><item><title>Integrating Generative AI in Hackathons: Opportunities, Challenges, and Educational Implications</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17434v3</link><description>Hackathons have emerged as pivotal platforms in the software industry,driving both innovation and skill development for organizations and studentsalike.

While it is well understood that linear TD convergesalmost surely to a unique point, this convergence traditionally requires theassumption that the features used by the approximator are linearly independent.However, this linear independence assumption does not hold in many practicalscenarios. This work is the first to establish the almost sure convergence oflinear TD without requiring linearly independent features. In fact, we do notmake any assumptions on the features. We prove that the approximated valuefunction converges to a unique point and the weight iterates converge to a set.We also establish a notion of local stability of the weight iterates.Importantly, we do not need to introduce any other additional assumptions anddo not need to make any modification to the linear TD algorithm.

However, each approach has its own limitations,making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging andpromising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractivesummarization methods.

This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDSframework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integratesextractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs anextractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This isachieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derivessemantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet networkstructures.

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as apowerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss inperformance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD andits innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transferknowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compactand efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and applicationacross various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts andhistorical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD arehighlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computationalefficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practicaldeployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy ofKD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate thebreadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific casestudies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the reviewdiscusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practicalconstraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensiveoverview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through thisorganization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KDbut also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributingsignificantly to both academic research and real-world applications.</description><author>Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 16:30:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12111v1</guid></item><item><title>Model-free quantification of completeness, uncertainties, and outliers in atomistic machine learning using information theory</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12367v2</link><description>An accurate description of information is relevant for a range of problems inatomistic machine learning (ML), such as crafting training sets, performinguncertainty quantification (UQ), or extracting physical insights from largedatasets.

Computer-assisted Surgery systemshave played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESDprocedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognitionof surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesioncharacteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-timesurgical phase recognition algorithms.

To address these issues, wepropose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phaserecognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporalmodeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance thecapture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditionaltemporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate theprocessing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinicalsettings.

Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, withlarge language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of valuemeasurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), anLLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded intext-revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine-tuning an LLM foraccurate perception-level value measurement and verifying the capability ofLLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.Applying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLMvalue measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometricmethodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-formoutputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis ofmeasurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) anattempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive powerof different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generationpsychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.</description><author>Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 16:26:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12106v1</guid></item><item><title>FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated Long-Tailed Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1</link><description>Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacyin distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across eachclient in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets canbe globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatlyaffects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federatedlearning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet itfails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglectingthe equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop amethodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in thelocal training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centredoptimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-artmethods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-taileddistribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT andCIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem ofmodel performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-taileddistribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.</description><author>Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 16:25:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1</guid></item><item><title>Contextual Breach: Assessing the Robustness of Transformer-based QA Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10997v2</link><description>Contextual question-answering models are susceptible to adversarialperturbations to input context, commonly observed in real-world scenarios.These adversarial noises are designed to degrade the performance of the modelby distorting the textual input.

Recently, thiscuriosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRIdata from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visualstimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the LatentDiffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complexvisual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they oftenlack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond merevisuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMseffectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible imagegenerations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggestingthat perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brainregions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brainregions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance fromsemantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual informationregions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. Wevalidate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively andqualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRIdata.</description><author>Jaehoon Joo, Taejin Jeong, Seongjae Hwang</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 16:19:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1</guid></item><item><title>VideoClusterNet: Self-Supervised and Adaptive Face Clustering For Videos</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12214v2</link><description>With the rise of digital media content production, the need for analyzingmovies and TV series episodes to locate the main cast of characters preciselyis gaining importance.Specifically, Video Face Clustering aims to grouptogether detected video face tracks with common facial identities. This problemis very challenging due to the large range of pose, expression, appearance, andlighting variations of a given face across video frames. Generic pre-trainedFace Identification (ID) models fail to adapt well to the video productiondomain, given its high dynamic range content and also unique cinematic style.Furthermore, traditional clustering algorithms depend on hyperparametersrequiring individual tuning across datasets. In this paper, we present a novelvideo face clustering approach that learns to adapt a generic face ID model tonew video face tracks in a fully self-supervised fashion.

Here, wepropose tools for the Analysis for Left Atrial Displacements and DeformatIonsusing online learning neural Networks (Aladdin) and present a technicalfeasibility study on how Aladdin can characterize 3D LA function globally andregionally. Aladdin includes an online segmentation and image registrationnetwork, and a strain calculation pipeline tailored to the LA. We create mapsof LA Displacement Vector Field (DVF) magnitude and LA principal strain valuesfrom images of 10 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with cardiovascular disease(CVD), of which 2 had large left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)impairment. We additionally create an atlas of these biomarkers using the datafrom the healthy volunteers. Results showed that Aladdin can accurately trackthe LA wall across the cardiac cycle and characterize its motion anddeformation. Global LA function markers assessed with Aladdin agree well withestimates from 2D Cine MRI. A more marked active contraction phase was observedin the healthy cohort, while the CVD LVEF group showed overall reduced LAfunction. Aladdin is uniquely able to identify LA regions with abnormaldeformation metrics that may indicate focal pathology. We expect Aladdin tohave important clinical applications as it can non-invasively characterizeatrial pathophysiology.

However, acquiring diversefood items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presentsunique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometricinformation (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especiallywhen foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policybased on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, suchrepresentations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverseacquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novelapproach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), whichintegrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhancethe robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approachcaptures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular,liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, andintroduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points andassess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategiesbased on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse foodacquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach'srobustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings.

To navigate such environments,agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have thegreatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that onlyprovide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that theordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisinglyimpactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performancecomparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation.While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no suchordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks becomemore challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest thatthe impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial.We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web anddesktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viableordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model toderive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agentbenchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels.

Reducedlaser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution andincreased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses.

Existing defense mechanismstypically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference andinvolve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not alwaysfeasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel andlightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require anadditional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model todisinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces asimple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely cleandata from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset isthen used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classificationlayer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activationclipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstratessuperior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, asconfirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.</description><author>Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 15:47:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1</guid></item><item><title>Adaptive Step Sizes for Preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Descent</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16956v2</link><description>This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive step sizes in stochasticgradient descent (SGD) by utilizing quantities that we have identified asnumerically traceable -- the Lipschitz constant for gradients and a concept ofthe local variance in search directions.

It involves integrating common-sense knowledge to reason aboutcomplex and often contextualized situations, e.g. ``scheduling a doctor'sappointment without a phone''. While current approaches show encouragingresults using large language models (LLMs), they are hindered by drawbacks suchas costly API calls and reproducibility issues. In this paper, we advocateplanning using smaller language models. We present PlaSma, a novel two-prongedapproach to endow small language models with procedural knowledge and(constrained) language planning capabilities. More concretely, we developsymbolic procedural knowledge distillation to enhance the commonsense knowledgein small language models and an inference-time algorithm to facilitate morestructured and accurate reasoning. In addition, we introduce a new relatedtask, Replanning, that requires a revision of a plan to cope with a constrainedsituation. In both the planning and replanning settings, we show thatorders-of-magnitude smaller models (770M-11B parameters) can compete and oftensurpass their larger teacher models' capabilities.

Often, one of the bottlenecks of detecting hemophilia is the lack ofdata available to train the algorithm to increase the accuracy. As a possiblesolution, this research investigated whether introducing augmented data by datasynthesis or traditional augmentation techniques can improve model accuracy,helping to diagnose the diseases. To tackle this research, features ofultrasound images were extracted by the pre-trained VGG-16, and similaritieswere compared by cosine similarity measure based on extracted features indifferent distributions among real images, synthetic images, and augmentationimages (Real vs. Real, Syn vs. Syn, Real vs. Different Batches of Syn, Real vs.Augmentation Techniques). Model testing performance was investigated usingEffientNet-B4 to recognize "blood" images with two augmentation methods. Inaddition, a gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualizationwas used to interpret the unexpected results like loss of accuracy. Syntheticand real images do not show high similarity, with a mean similarity score of0.4737. Synthetic batch 1 dataset and images by horizontal flip are moresimilar to the original images. Classic augmentation techniques and datasynthesis can improve model accuracy, and data by traditional augmentationtechniques have a better performance than synthetic data. In addition, theGrad-CAM heatmap figured out the loss of accuracy is due to a shift in thedomain. Overall, this research found that two augmentation methods, datasynthesis and traditional augmentation techniques, both can improve accuracy toa certain extent to help to diagnose rare diseases.</description><author>Qianyu Fan</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 15:17:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05225v2</guid></item><item><title>Operational Wind Speed Forecasts for Chile's Electric Power Sector Using a Hybrid ML Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09263v3</link><description>As Chile's electric power sector advances toward a future powered byrenewable energy, accurate forecasting of renewable generation is essential formanaging grid operations.

While most approaches in the SafeReinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints androbot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy themin complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches thatincorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learningframework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly onthe real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robotdynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hardto obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive tocompute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safetyrequirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safeexploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focuson ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty.

Traditional rPPG models often struggle with poor generalizationcapacity in unseen domains. Current solutions to this problem is to improve itsgeneralization in the target domain through Domain Generalization (DG) orDomain Adaptation (DA). However, both traditional methods require access toboth source domain data and target domain data, which cannot be implemented inscenarios with limited access to source data, and another issue is the privacyof accessing source domain data.

Existing works focus on the simplified setting in which the streamhas a known finite length or is segmented into smaller sequences, leveragingwell-established learning strategies from statistical machine learning. In thispaper, the problem of learning over time is rethought from scratch, leveragingtools from optimal control theory, which yield a unifying view of the temporaldynamics of neural computations and learning. Hamiltonian Learning is based ondifferential equations that: (i) can be integrated without the need of externalsoftware solvers; (ii) generalize the well-established notion of gradient-basedlearning in feed-forward and recurrent networks; (iii) open to novelperspectives. The proposed framework is showcased by experimentally proving howit can recover gradient-based learning, comparing it to out-of-the boxoptimizers, and describing how it is flexible enough to switch from fully-localto partially/non-local computational schemes, possibly distributed overmultiple devices, and BackPropagation without storing activations.

However, only a fraction of these glaciersbenefit from consistent and detailed in-situ observations that allow forassessing their status and changes over time. This limitation can, in part, beovercome by relying on satellite-based Earth Observation techniques.Satellite-based glacier mapping applications have historically mainly relied onmanual and semi-automatic detection methods, while recently, a fast and notabletransition to deep learning techniques has started. This chapter reviews how combining multi-sensor remote sensing data and deeplearning allows us to better delineate (i.e. map) glaciers and detect theirtemporal changes. We explain how relying on deep learning multi-sensorframeworks to map glaciers benefits from the extensive availability of regionaland global glacier inventories. We also analyse the rationale behind glaciermapping, the benefits of deep learning methodologies, and the inherentchallenges in integrating multi-sensor earth observation data with deeplearning algorithms. While our review aims to provide a broad overview of glacier mapping efforts,we highlight a few setups where deep learning multi-sensor remote sensingapplications have a considerable potential added value. This includesapplications for debris-covered and rock glaciers that are visually difficultto distinguish from surroundings and for calving glaciers that are in contactwith the ocean. These specific cases are illustrated through a series of visualimageries, highlighting some significant advantages and challenges whendetecting glacier changes, including dealing with seasonal snow cover, changingdebris coverage, and distinguishing glacier fronts from the surrounding seaice.</description><author>Codruţ-Andrei Diaconu, Konrad Heidler, Jonathan L.

As a powerfulknowledge-driven tool, copula theory performs well in modeling relationshipsamong random variables. To enhance the interpretability of existing neuralnetworks for CD, we propose a knowledge-data-driven heterogeneous CD methodbased on a copula-guided neural network, named NN-Copula-CD. In ourNN-Copula-CD, the mathematical characteristics of copula are employed as theloss functions to supervise a neural network to learn the dependence betweenbi-temporal heterogeneous superpixel pairs, and then the changed regions areidentified via binary classification based on the degrees of dependence of allthe superpixel pairs in the bi-temporal images. We conduct in-depth experimentson three datasets with heterogeneous images, including optical, syntheticaperture radar, multispectral, and near-infrared images, where bothquantitative and visual results demonstrate both the effectiveness andinterpretability of our proposed NN-Copula-CD method.</description><author>Weiming Li, Xueqian Wang, Gang Li, Baocheng Geng, Pramod K.

However, they areinherently limited to modeling only pairwise interactions, making it difficultto explicitly capture the complexity of systems with $n$-body relations. Toaddress this, topological deep learning has emerged as a promising field forstudying and modeling higher-order interactions using various topologicaldomains, such as simplicial and cellular complexes. While these new domainsprovide powerful representations, they introduce new challenges, such aseffectively modeling the interactions among higher-order structures throughhigher-order MP. Meanwhile, structured state-space sequence models have provento be effective for sequence modeling and have recently been adapted for graphdata by encoding the neighborhood of a node as a sequence, thereby avoiding theMP mechanism. In this work, we propose a novel architecture designed to operatewith simplicial complexes, utilizing the Mamba state-space model as itsbackbone. Our approach generates sequences for the nodes based on theneighboring cells, enabling direct communication between all higher-orderstructures, regardless of their rank. We extensively validate our model,demonstrating that it achieves competitive performance compared tostate-of-the-art models developed for simplicial complexes.</description><author>Marco Montagna, Simone Scardapane, Lev Telyatnikov</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 14:49:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12033v1</guid></item><item><title>PhysMamba: Efficient Remote Physiological Measurement with SlowFast Temporal Difference Mamba</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12031v1</link><description>Facial-video based Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) aims at measuringphysiological signals and monitoring heart activity without any contact,showing significant potential in various applications. Previous deep learningbased rPPG measurement are primarily based on CNNs and Transformers. However,the limited receptive fields of CNNs restrict their ability to capturelong-range spatio-temporal dependencies, while Transformers also struggle withmodeling long video sequences with high complexity. Recently, the state spacemodels (SSMs) represented by Mamba are known for their impressive performanceon capturing long-range dependencies from long sequences. In this paper, wepropose the PhysMamba, a Mamba-based framework, to efficiently representlong-range physiological dependencies from facial videos. Specifically, weintroduce the Temporal Difference Mamba block to first enhance local dynamicdifferences and further model the long-range spatio-temporal context. Moreover,a dual-stream SlowFast architecture is utilized to fuse the multi-scaletemporal features. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmarkdatasets to demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of PhysMamba.

Methods based on functional causal models canidentify a unique graph, but either suffer from the curse of dimensionality orimpose strong parametric assumptions. To address these challenges, we propose anovel hybrid approach for global causal discovery in observational data thatleverages local causal substructures. We first present a topological sortingalgorithm that leverages ancestral relationships in linear structural equationmodels to establish a compact top-down hierarchical ordering, encoding morecausal information than linear orderings produced by existing methods. Wedemonstrate that this approach generalizes to nonlinear settings with arbitrarynoise. We then introduce a nonparametric constraint-based algorithm that prunesspurious edges by searching for local conditioning sets, achieving greateraccuracy than current methods. We provide theoretical guarantees forcorrectness and worst-case polynomial time complexities, with empiricalvalidation on synthetic data.</description><author>Sujai Hiremath, Jacqueline R. M. A.

Historically, experts have manually interpretedSSS images, relying on conventional machine learning techniques withhand-crafted features. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) significantlyadvanced automated classification in this domain, they often fall short whendealing with diverse seafloor textures, such as rocky or ripple sand bottoms,where false positive rates may increase. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs)have shown potential in addressing these limitations by utilizing aself-attention mechanism to capture global information in image patches,offering more flexibility in processing spatial hierarchies. This paperrigorously compares the performance of ViT models alongside commonly used CNNarchitectures, such as ResNet and ConvNext, for binary classification tasks inSSS imagery. The dataset encompasses diverse geographical seafloor types and isbalanced between the presence and absence of man-made objects. ViT-based modelsexhibit superior classification performance across f1-score, precision, recall,and accuracy metrics, although at the cost of greater computational resources.CNNs, with their inductive biases, demonstrate better computational efficiency,making them suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments likeunderwater vehicles. Future research directions include exploringself-supervised learning for ViTs and multi-modal fusion to further enhanceperformance in challenging underwater environments.</description><author>BW Sheffield, Jeffrey Ellen, Ben Whitmore</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 14:36:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12026v1</guid></item><item><title>Mitigating Urban-Rural Disparities in Contrastive Representation Learning with Satellite Imagery</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08672v3</link><description>Satellite imagery is being leveraged for many societally critical tasksacross climate, economics, and public health. Yet, because of heterogeneity inlandscapes (e.g. how a road looks in different places), models can showdisparate performance across geographic areas. Given the important potential ofdisparities in algorithmic systems used in societal contexts, here we considerthe risk of urban-rural disparities in identification of land-cover features.This is via semantic segmentation (a common computer vision task in which imageregions are labelled according to what is being shown) which uses pre-trainedimage representations generated via contrastive self-supervised learning. Wepropose fair dense representation with contrastive learning (FairDCL) as amethod for de-biasing the multi-level latent space of convolution neuralnetwork models. The method improves feature identification by removing spuriousmodel representations which are disparately distributed across urban and ruralareas, and is achieved in an unsupervised way by contrastive pre-training. Theobtained image representation mitigates downstream urban-rural predictiondisparities and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on real-world satelliteimages. Embedding space evaluation and ablation studies further demonstrateFairDCL's robustness. As generalizability and robustness in geographic imageryis a nascent topic, our work motivates researchers to consider metrics beyondaverage accuracy in such applications.</description><author>Miao Zhang, Rumi Chunara</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 14:35:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08672v3</guid></item><item><title>LEMON: Localized Editing with Mesh Optimization and Neural Shaders</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12024v1</link><description>In practical use cases, polygonal mesh editing can be faster than generatingnew ones, but it can still be challenging and time-consuming for users.Existing solutions for this problem tend to focus on a single task, eithergeometry or novel view synthesis, which often leads to disjointed resultsbetween the mesh and view. In this work, we propose LEMON, a mesh editingpipeline that combines neural deferred shading with localized meshoptimization. Our approach begins by identifying the most important vertices inthe mesh for editing, utilizing a segmentation model to focus on these keyregions. Given multi-view images of an object, we optimize a neural shader anda polygonal mesh while extracting the normal map and the rendered image fromeach view. By using these outputs as conditioning data, we edit the inputimages with a text-to-image diffusion model and iteratively update our datasetwhile deforming the mesh. This process results in a polygonal mesh that isedited according to the given text instruction, preserving the geometriccharacteristics of the initial mesh while focusing on the most significantareas. We evaluate our pipeline using the DTU dataset, demonstrating that itgenerates finely-edited meshes more rapidly than the current state-of-the-artmethods.

The exploration of effectivecollaborative training settings capable of leveraging valuable knowledge fromdistributed and isolated datasets is increasingly crucial. This studyinvestigates key factors that impact the effectiveness of collaborativetraining methods in code next-token prediction, as well as the correctness andutility of the generated code, demonstrating the promise of such methods.Additionally, we evaluate the memorization of different participant trainingdata across various collaborative training settings, including centralized,federated, and incremental training, highlighting their potential risks inleaking data. Our findings indicate that the size and diversity of codedatasets are pivotal factors influencing the success of collaboratively trainedcode models. We show that federated learning achieves competitive performancecompared to centralized training while offering better data protection, asevidenced by lower memorization ratios in the generated code. However,federated learning can still produce verbatim code snippets from hiddentraining data, potentially violating privacy or copyright. Our study furtherexplores effectiveness and memorization patterns in incremental learning,emphasizing the sequence in which individual participant datasets areintroduced. We also identify cross-organizational clones as a prevalentchallenge in both centralized and federated learning scenarios. Our findingshighlight the persistent risk of data leakage during inference, even whentraining data remains unseen.

Real-timeforecasting of cloud movement and, as a result, solar irradiance is necessaryto schedule and allocate energy across grid-connected photovoltaic systems.Previous works monitored cloud movement using wide-angle field of view imageryof the sky. However, such images have poor resolution for clouds that appearnear the horizon, which reduces their effectiveness for long term prediction ofsolar occlusion. Specifically, to be able to predict occlusion of the sun overlong time periods, clouds that are near the horizon need to be detected, andtheir velocities estimated precisely. To enable such a system, we design anddeploy a catadioptric system that delivers wide-angle imagery with uniformspatial resolution of the sky over its field of view. To enable prediction overa longer time horizon, we design an algorithm that uses carefully selectedspatio-temporal slices of the imagery using estimated wind direction andvelocity as inputs. Using ray-tracing simulations as well as a real testbeddeployed outdoors, we show that the system is capable of predicting solarocclusion as well as irradiance for tens of minutes in the future, which is anorder of magnitude improvement over prior work.</description><author>Leron Julian, Haejoon Lee, Soummya Kar, Aswin C.

Neural radiance fields(NeRF) have become popular as a machine learning technique capable of deducingthe bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of a scene frommultiple images. However, prior research has largely concentrated on applyingNeRF to close-range imagery, estimating basic Microfacet BRDF models, whichfall short for many Earth surfaces. Moreover, high-quality NeRFs generallyrequire several images captured simultaneously, a rare occurrence in satelliteimaging. To address these limitations, we propose BRDF-NeRF, developed toexplicitly estimate the Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (RPV) model, a semi-empiricalBRDF model commonly employed in remote sensing. We assess our approach usingtwo datasets: (1) Djibouti, captured in a single epoch at varying viewingangles with a fixed Sun position, and (2) Lanzhou, captured over multipleepochs with different viewing angles and Sun positions. Our results, based ononly three to four satellite images for training, demonstrate that BRDF-NeRFcan effectively synthesize novel views from directions far removed from thetraining data and produce high-quality digital surface models (DSMs).</description><author>Lulin Zhang, Ewelina Rupnik, Tri Dung Nguyen, Stéphane Jacquemoud, Yann Klinger</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 14:28:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12014v1</guid></item><item><title>Checklist to Define the Identification of TP, FP, and FN Object Detections in Automated Driving</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07106v2</link><description>The object perception of automated driving systems must pass quality androbustness tests before a safe deployment.

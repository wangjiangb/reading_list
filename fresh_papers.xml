Specifically, weintegrate an instance-level grounding head into a pre-trained, generativediffusion model, to augment it with the ability of localising arbitraryinstances in the generated images. The grounding head is trained to align thetext embedding of category names with the regional visual feature of thediffusion model, using supervision from an off-the-shelf object detector, and anovel self-training scheme on (novel) categories not covered by the detector.This enhanced version of diffusion model, termed as InstaGen, can serve as adata synthesizer for object detection. We conduct thorough experiments to showthat, object detector can be enhanced while training on the synthetic datasetfrom InstaGen, demonstrating superior performance over existingstate-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary (+4.5 AP) and data-sparse (+1.2 to5.2 AP) scenarios.</description><author>Chengjian Feng, Yujie Zhong, Zequn Jie, Weidi Xie, Lin Ma</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:59:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05937v1</guid></item><item><title>SPHINX-X: Scaling Data and Parameters for a Family of Multi-modal Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05935v1</link><description>We propose SPHINX-X, an extensive Multimodality Large Language Model (MLLM)series developed upon SPHINX. To improve the architecture and trainingefficiency, we modify the SPHINX framework by removing redundant visualencoders, bypassing fully-padded sub-images with skip tokens, and simplifyingmulti-stage training into a one-stage all-in-one paradigm. To fully unleash thepotential of MLLMs, we assemble a comprehensive multi-domain and multimodaldataset covering publicly available resources in language, vision, andvision-language tasks. We further enrich this collection with our curated OCRintensive and Set-of-Mark datasets, extending the diversity and generality. Bytraining over different base LLMs including TinyLlama1.1B, InternLM2-7B,LLaMA2-13B, and Mixtral8x7B, we obtain a spectrum of MLLMs that vary inparameter size and multilingual capabilities.

Recently, distillation methods succeeded ineliminating the use of GNNs at test time but they still require them duringtraining. We perform a careful analysis of the role that GNNs play indistillation methods. This analysis leads us to propose a fully GNN-freeapproach for node classification, not requiring them at train or test time. Ourmethod consists of three key components: smoothness constraints,pseudo-labeling iterations and neighborhood-label histograms. Our finalapproach can match the state-of-the-art accuracy on standard popular benchmarkssuch as citation and co-purchase networks, without training a GNN.</description><author>Daniel Winter, Niv Cohen, Yedid Hoshen</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:59:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05934v1</guid></item><item><title>Time Series Diffusion in the Frequency Domain</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05933v1</link><description>Fourier analysis has been an instrumental tool in the development of signalprocessing. This leads us to wonder whether this framework could similarlybenefit generative modelling. In this paper, we explore this question throughthe scope of time series diffusion models. More specifically, we analyzewhether representing time series in the frequency domain is a useful inductivebias for score-based diffusion models. By starting from the canonical SDEformulation of diffusion in the time domain, we show that a dual diffusionprocess occurs in the frequency domain with an important nuance: Brownianmotions are replaced by what we call mirrored Brownian motions, characterizedby mirror symmetries among their components. Building on this insight, we showhow to adapt the denoising score matching approach to implement diffusionmodels in the frequency domain. This results in frequency diffusion models,which we compare to canonical time diffusion models. Our empirical evaluationon real-world datasets, covering various domains like healthcare and finance,shows that frequency diffusion models better capture the training distributionthan time diffusion models. We explain this observation by showing that timeseries from these datasets tend to be more localized in the frequency domainthan in the time domain, which makes them easier to model in the former case.All our observations point towards impactful synergies between Fourier analysisand diffusion models.</description><author>Jonathan Crabb√©, Nicolas Huynh, Jan Stanczuk, Mihaela van der Schaar</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:59:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05933v1</guid></item><item><title>Driving Everywhere with Large Language Model Policy Adaptation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05932v1</link><description>Adapting driving behavior to new environments, customs, and laws is along-standing problem in autonomous driving, precluding the widespreaddeployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we present LLaDA, asimple yet powerful tool that enables human drivers and autonomous vehiclesalike to drive everywhere by adapting their tasks and motion plans to trafficrules in new locations. LLaDA achieves this by leveraging the impressivezero-shot generalizability of large language models (LLMs) in interpreting thetraffic rules in the local driver handbook. Through an extensive user study, weshow that LLaDA's instructions are useful in disambiguating in-the-wildunexpected situations. We also demonstrate LLaDA's ability to adapt AV motionplanning policies in real-world datasets; LLaDA outperforms baseline planningapproaches on all our metrics.

While uncertaintyimparts errors across all demographic groups, this paper shows that the typesof errors vary systematically: Groups with higher average outcomes aretypically assigned higher false positive rates, while those with lower averageoutcomes are assigned higher false negative rates. We characterize theconditions that give rise to this disparate impact and explain why theintuitive remedy to omit demographic variables from datasets does not correctit. Instead of data omission, this paper examines how data enrichment canbroaden access to opportunity. The strategy, which we call "AffirmativeInformation," could stand as an alternative to Affirmative Action.</description><author>Claire Lazar Reich</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:58:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10019v5</guid></item><item><title>An Interactive Agent Foundation Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05929v1</link><description>The development of artificial intelligence systems is transitioning fromcreating static, task-specific models to dynamic, agent-based systems capableof performing well in a wide range of applications. We propose an InteractiveAgent Foundation Model that uses a novel multi-task agent training paradigm fortraining AI agents across a wide range of domains, datasets, and tasks. Ourtraining paradigm unifies diverse pre-training strategies, including visualmasked auto-encoders, language modeling, and next-action prediction, enabling aversatile and adaptable AI framework. We demonstrate the performance of ourframework across three separate domains -- Robotics, Gaming AI, and Healthcare.Our model demonstrates its ability to generate meaningful and contextuallyrelevant outputs in each area. The strength of our approach lies in itsgenerality, leveraging a variety of data sources such as robotics sequences,gameplay data, large-scale video datasets, and textual information foreffective multimodal and multi-task learning.

To support this problem, we introduceWEBLINX - a large-scale benchmark of 100K interactions across 2300 expertdemonstrations of conversational web navigation. Our benchmark covers a broadrange of patterns on over 150 real-world websites and can be used to train andevaluate agents in diverse scenarios. Due to the magnitude of informationpresent, Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot process entire web pages inreal-time. To solve this bottleneck, we design a retrieval-inspired model thatefficiently prunes HTML pages by ranking relevant elements. We use the selectedelements, along with screenshots and action history, to assess a variety ofmodels for their ability to replicate human behavior when navigating the web.Our experiments span from small text-only to proprietary multimodal LLMs. Wefind that smaller finetuned decoders surpass the best zero-shot LLMs (includingGPT-4V), but also larger finetuned multimodal models which were explicitlypretrained on screenshots. However, all finetuned models struggle to generalizeto unseen websites. Our findings highlight the need for large multimodal modelsthat can generalize to novel settings.

Our inquiry is motivated by thesearch for a sharp noise interaction term, or variance proxy, in learning withdependent data. Absent any realizability assumption, typical non-asymptoticresults exhibit variance proxies that are deflated \emph{multiplicatively} bythe mixing time of the underlying covariates process. We show that whenever thetopologies of $L^2$ and $\Psi_p$ are comparable on our hypothesis class$\mathscr{F}$ -- that is, $\mathscr{F}$ is a weakly sub-Gaussian class:$\|f\|_{\Psi_p} \lesssim \|f\|_{L^2}^\eta$ for some $\eta\in (0,1]$ -- theempirical risk minimizer achieves a rate that only depends on the complexity ofthe class and second order statistics in its leading term. Our result holdswhether the problem is realizable or not and we refer to this as a \emph{nearmixing-free rate}, since direct dependence on mixing is relegated to anadditive higher order term. We arrive at our result by combining the abovenotion of a weakly sub-Gaussian class with mixed tail generic chaining. Thiscombination allows us to compute sharp, instance-optimal rates for a wide rangeof problems. %Our approach, reliant on mixed tail generic chaining, allows usto obtain sharp, instance-optimal rates. Examples that satisfy our frameworkinclude sub-Gaussian linear regression, more general smoothly parameterizedfunction classes, finite hypothesis classes, and bounded smoothness classes.</description><author>Ingvar Ziemann, Stephen Tu, George J.

To circumvent this, we explore the novel integrationof Memory-efficient Zeroth-Order Optimization within a federated setting, asynergy we denote as FedMeZO. Our study is the first to examine the theoreticalunderpinnings of FedMeZO in the context of LLMs, tackling key questionsregarding the influence of large parameter spaces on optimization behavior, theestablishment of convergence properties, and the identification of criticalparameters for convergence to inform personalized federated strategies. Ourextensive empirical evidence supports the theory, showing that FedMeZO not onlyconverges faster than traditional first-order methods such as SGD but alsosignificantly reduces GPU memory usage during training to levels comparable tothose during inference. Moreover, the proposed personalized FL strategy that isbuilt upon the theoretical insights to customize the client-wise learning ratecan effectively accelerate loss reduction. We hope our work can help to bridgetheoretical and practical aspects of federated fine-tuning for LLMs andfacilitate further development and research.</description><author>Zhenqing Ling, Daoyuan Chen, Liuyi Yao, Yaliang Li, Ying Shen</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:56:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05926v1</guid></item><item><title>Collaborative Control for Geometry-Conditioned PBR Image Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05919v1</link><description>Current 3D content generation builds on generative models that output RGBimages. Modern graphics pipelines, however, require physically-based rendering(PBR) material properties. We propose to model the PBR image distributiondirectly to avoid photometric inaccuracies in RGB generation and the inherentambiguity in extracting PBR from RGB. Existing paradigms for cross-modalfinetuning are not suited for PBR generation due to a lack of data and the highdimensionality of the output modalities: we overcome both challenges byretaining a frozen RGB model and tightly linking a newly trained PBR modelusing a novel cross-network communication paradigm. As the base RGB model isfully frozen, the proposed method does not risk catastrophic forgetting duringfinetuning and remains compatible with techniques such as IPAdapter pretrainedfor the base RGB model. We validate our design choices, robustness to datasparsity, and compare against existing paradigms with an extensive experimentalsection.</description><author>Shimon Vainer, Mark Boss, Mathias Parger, Konstantin Kutsy, Dante De Nigris, Ciara Rowles, Nicolas Perony, Simon Donn√©</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:53:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05919v1</guid></item><item><title>Point-VOS: Pointing Up Video Object Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05917v1</link><description>Current state-of-the-art Video Object Segmentation (VOS) methods rely ondense per-object mask annotations both during training and testing. Thisrequires time-consuming and costly video annotation mechanisms. We propose anovel Point-VOS task with a spatio-temporally sparse point-wise annotationscheme that substantially reduces the annotation effort. We apply ourannotation scheme to two large-scale video datasets with text descriptions andannotate over 19M points across 133K objects in 32K videos. Based on ourannotations, we propose a new Point-VOS benchmark, and a correspondingpoint-based training mechanism, which we use to establish strong baselineresults. We show that existing VOS methods can easily be adapted to leverageour point annotations during training, and can achieve results close to thefully-supervised performance when trained on pseudo-masks generated from thesepoints. In addition, we show that our data can be used to improve models thatconnect vision and language, by evaluating it on the Video Narrative Grounding(VNG) task.

A recent effective paradigm is to performstage-wise training, where the size of the model is gradually increased overthe course of training (e.g. gradual stacking (Reddi et al., 2023)). While theresource and wall-time savings are appealing, it has limitations, particularlythe inability to evaluate the full model during earlier stages, and degradationin model quality due to smaller model capacity in the initial stages. In thiswork, we propose an alternative framework, progressive subnetwork training,that maintains the full model throughout training, but only trains subnetworkswithin the model in each step. We focus on a simple instantiation of thisframework, Random Path Training (RaPTr) that only trains a sub-path of layersin each step, progressively increasing the path lengths in stages. RaPTrachieves better pre-training loss for BERT and UL2 language models whilerequiring 20-33% fewer FLOPs compared to standard training, and is competitiveor better than other efficient training methods. Furthermore, RaPTr showsbetter downstream performance on UL2, improving QA tasks and SuperGLUE by 1-5%compared to standard training and stacking. Finally, we provide a theoreticalbasis for RaPTr to justify (a) the increasing complexity of subnetworks instages, and (b) the stability in loss across stage transitions due to residualconnections and layer norm.</description><author>Abhishek Panigrahi, Nikunj Saunshi, Kaifeng Lyu, Sobhan Miryoosefi, Sashank Reddi, Satyen Kale, Sanjiv Kumar</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:49:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05913v1</guid></item><item><title>Risk-Sensitive Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Network Aggregative Markov Games</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05906v1</link><description>Classical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) assumes risk neutralityand complete objectivity for agents. However, in settings where agents need toconsider or model human economic or social preferences, a notion of risk mustbe incorporated into the RL optimization problem. This will be of greaterimportance in MARL where other human or non-human agents are involved, possiblywith their own risk-sensitive policies. In this work, we considerrisk-sensitive and non-cooperative MARL with cumulative prospect theory (CPT),a non-convex risk measure and a generalization of coherent measures of risk.CPT is capable of explaining loss aversion in humans and their tendency tooverestimate/underestimate small/large probabilities. We propose a distributedsampling-based actor-critic (AC) algorithm with CPT risk for networkaggregative Markov games (NAMGs), which we call Distributed Nested CPT-AC.Under a set of assumptions, we prove the convergence of the algorithm to asubjective notion of Markov perfect Nash equilibrium in NAMGs. The experimentalresults show that subjective CPT policies obtained by our algorithm can bedifferent from the risk-neutral ones, and agents with a higher loss aversionare more inclined to socially isolate themselves in an NAMG.</description><author>Hafez Ghaemi, Hamed Kebriaei, Alireza Ramezani Moghaddam, Majid Nili Ahamdabadi</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:43:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05906v1</guid></item><item><title>FACT-GPT: Fact-Checking Augmentation via Claim Matching with LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05904v1</link><description>Our society is facing rampant misinformation harming public health and trust.To address the societal challenge, we introduce FACT-GPT, a system leveragingLarge Language Models (LLMs) to automate the claim matching stage offact-checking.

However, itscurrent model is trained on a diverse dataset not tailored to medical images,particularly ultrasound images. Ultrasound images tend to have a lot of noise,making it difficult to segment out important structures. In this project, wedeveloped ClickSAM, which fine-tunes the Segment Anything Model using clickprompts for ultrasound images. ClickSAM has two stages of training: the firststage is trained on single-click prompts centered in the ground-truth contours,and the second stage focuses on improving the model performance throughadditional positive and negative click prompts. By comparing the first stagepredictions to the ground-truth masks, true positive, false positive, and falsenegative segments are calculated. Positive clicks are generated using the truepositive and false negative segments, and negative clicks are generated usingthe false positive segments. The Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation algorithm isthen employed to collect positive and negative click prompts in each segmentthat are used to enhance the model performance during the second stage oftraining. With click-train methods, ClickSAM exhibits superior performancecompared to other existing models for ultrasound image segmentation.</description><author>Aimee Guo, Gace Fei, Hemanth Pasupuletic, Jing Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:41:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05902v1</guid></item><item><title>EfficientAD: Accurate Visual Anomaly Detection at Millisecond-Level Latencies</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14535v3</link><description>Detecting anomalies in images is an important task, especially in real-timecomputer vision applications. In this work, we focus on computationalefficiency and propose a lightweight feature extractor that processes an imagein less than a millisecond on a modern GPU. We then use a student-teacherapproach to detect anomalous features. We train a student network to predictthe extracted features of normal, i.e., anomaly-free training images. Thedetection of anomalies at test time is enabled by the student failing topredict their features. We propose a training loss that hinders the studentfrom imitating the teacher feature extractor beyond the normal images. Itallows us to drastically reduce the computational cost of the student-teachermodel, while improving the detection of anomalous features. We furthermoreaddress the detection of challenging logical anomalies that involve invalidcombinations of normal local features, for example, a wrong ordering ofobjects. We detect these anomalies by efficiently incorporating an autoencoderthat analyzes images globally. We evaluate our method, called EfficientAD, on32 datasets from three industrial anomaly detection dataset collections.EfficientAD sets new standards for both the detection and the localization ofanomalies. At a latency of two milliseconds and a throughput of six hundredimages per second, it enables a fast handling of anomalies. Together with itslow error rate, this makes it an economical solution for real-worldapplications and a fruitful basis for future research.</description><author>Kilian Batzner, Lars Heckler, Rebecca K√∂nig</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:38:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14535v3</guid></item><item><title>SudokuSens: Enhancing Deep Learning Robustness for IoT Sensing Applications using a Generative Approach</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02275v2</link><description>This paper introduces SudokuSens, a generative framework for automatedgeneration of training data in machine-learning-based Internet-of-Things (IoT)applications, such that the generated synthetic data mimic experimentalconfigurations not encountered during actual sensor data collection. Theframework improves the robustness of resulting deep learning models, and isintended for IoT applications where data collection is expensive. The work ismotivated by the fact that IoT time-series data entangle the signatures ofobserved objects with the confounding intrinsic properties of the surroundingenvironment and the dynamic environmental disturbances experienced. Toincorporate sufficient diversity into the IoT training data, one thereforeneeds to consider a combinatorial explosion of training cases that aremultiplicative in the number of objects considered and the possibleenvironmental conditions in which such objects may be encountered. Ourframework substantially reduces these multiplicative training needs. Todecouple object signatures from environmental conditions, we employ aConditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that allows us to reduce datacollection needs from multiplicative to (nearly) linear, while syntheticallygenerating (data for) the missing conditions. To obtain robustness with respectto dynamic disturbances, a session-aware temporal contrastive learning approachis taken. Integrating the aforementioned two approaches, SudokuSenssignificantly improves the robustness of deep learning for IoT applications. Weexplore the degree to which SudokuSens benefits downstream inference tasks indifferent data sets and discuss conditions under which the approach isparticularly effective.</description><author>Tianshi Wang, Jinyang Li, Ruijie Wang, Denizhan Kara, Shengzhong Liu, Davis Wertheimer, Antoni Viros-i-Martin, Raghu Ganti, Mudhakar Srivatsa, Tarek Abdelzaher</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:35:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02275v2</guid></item><item><title>Large Language Model Meets Graph Neural Network in Knowledge Distillation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05894v1</link><description>Despite recent community revelations about the advancements and potential ofLarge Language Models (LLMs) in understanding Text-Attributed Graphs (TAG), thedeployment of LLMs for production is hindered by their high computational andstorage requirements, as well as long latencies during inference.Simultaneously, although traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are lightweight and adept at learning structural features of graphs, their ability tograsp the complex semantics in TAGs is somewhat constrained for realapplications. To address these limitations, we concentrate on the downstreamtask of node classification in TAG and propose a novel graph knowledgedistillation framework, termed Linguistic Graph Knowledge Distillation(LinguGKD), using LLMs as teacher models and GNNs as student models forknowledge distillation. It involves TAG-oriented instruction tuning of LLM ondesigned node classification prompts, followed by aligning the hierarchicallylearned node features of the teacher LLM and the student GNN in latent space,employing a layer-adaptive contrastive learning strategy. Through extensiveexperiments on a variety of LLM and GNN models and multiple benchmark datasets,the proposed LinguGKD significantly boosts the student GNN's predictiveaccuracy and convergence rate, without the need of extra data or modelparameters.

In contrast toother studies that have either presented a general overview of the recentadvancements in MAPF or extensively reviewed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)within multi-agent system settings independently, our work presented in thisreview paper focuses on highlighting the integration of DRL-based approaches inMAPF.

However, the use of self-attention layers in a Transformerincurs prohibitive compute and memory complexity that scales quadraticallyw.r.t. the sequence length. A recent architecture, Mamba, based on state spacemodels has been shown to achieve comparable performance for modeling textsequences, while scaling linearly with the sequence length. In this work, wepresent Mamba-ND, a generalized design extending the Mamba architecture toarbitrary multi-dimensional data. Our design alternatively unravels the inputdata across different dimensions following row-major orderings. We provide asystematic comparison of Mamba-ND with several other alternatives, based onprior multi-dimensional extensions such as Bi-directional LSTMs and S4ND.Empirically, we show that Mamba-ND demonstrates performance competitive withthe state-of-the-art on a variety of multi-dimensional benchmarks, includingImageNet-1K classification, HMDB-51 action recognition, and ERA5 weatherforecasting.</description><author>Shufan Li, Harkanwar Singh, Aditya Grover</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:30:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05892v1</guid></item><item><title>CREMA: Multimodal Compositional Video Reasoning via Efficient Modular Adaptation and Fusion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05889v1</link><description>Despite impressive advancements in multimodal compositional reasoningapproaches, they are still limited in their flexibility and efficiency byprocessing fixed modality inputs while updating a lot of model parameters. Thispaper tackles these critical challenges and proposes CREMA, an efficient andmodular modality-fusion framework for injecting any new modality into videoreasoning. We first augment multiple informative modalities (such as opticalflow, 3D point cloud, audio) from given videos without extra human annotationby leveraging existing pre-trained models. Next, we introduce a querytransformer with multiple parameter-efficient modules associated with eachaccessible modality. It projects diverse modality features to the LLM tokenembedding space, allowing the model to integrate different data types forresponse generation. Furthermore, we propose a fusion module designed tocompress multimodal queries, maintaining computational efficiency in the LLMwhile combining additional modalities. We validate our method on video-3D,video-audio, and video-language reasoning tasks and achieve better/equivalentperformance against strong multimodal LLMs, including BLIP-2, 3D-LLM, andSeViLA while using 96% fewer trainable parameters. We provide extensiveanalyses of CREMA, including the impact of each modality on reasoning domains,the design of the fusion module, and example visualizations.</description><author>Shoubin Yu, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:27:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05889v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning to Rewrite Prompts for Personalized Text Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00152v2</link><description>Facilitated by large language models (LLMs), personalized text generation hasbecome a rapidly growing research direction. Most existing studies focus ondesigning specialized models for a particular domain, or they requirefine-tuning the LLMs to generate personalized text. We consider a typicalscenario in which the large language model, which generates personalizedoutput, is frozen and can only be accessed through APIs. Under this constraint,all one can do is to improve the input text (i.e., text prompts) sent to theLLM, a procedure that is usually done manually. In this paper, we propose anovel method to automatically revise prompts for personalized text generation.The proposed method takes the initial prompts generated by a state-of-the-art,multistage framework for personalized generation and rewrites a few criticalcomponents that summarize and synthesize the personal context. The promptrewriter employs a training paradigm that chains together supervised learning(SL) and reinforcement learning (RL), where SL reduces the search space of RLand RL facilitates end-to-end training of the rewriter. Using datasets fromthree representative domains, we demonstrate that the rewritten promptsoutperform both the original prompts and the prompts optimized via supervisedlearning or reinforcement learning alone. In-depth analysis of the rewrittenprompts shows that they are not only human readable, but also able to guidemanual revision of prompts when there is limited resource to employreinforcement learning to train the prompt rewriter, or when it is costly todeploy an automatic prompt rewriter for inference.</description><author>Cheng Li, Mingyang Zhang, Qiaozhu Mei, Weize Kong, Michael Bendersky</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:23:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00152v2</guid></item><item><title>EUGENE: Explainable Unsupervised Approximation of Graph Edit Distance</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05885v1</link><description>The need to identify graphs having small structural distance from a queryarises in biology, chemistry, recommender systems, and social network analysis.Among several methods to measure inter graph distance, Graph Edit Distance(GED) is preferred for its comprehensibility, yet hindered by the NP-hardnessof its computation. State-of-the-art GED approximations predominantly employneural methods, which, however, (i) lack an explanatory edit path correspondingto the approximated GED; (ii) require the NP-hard generation of ground-truthGEDs for training; and (iii) necessitate separate training on each dataset. Inthis paper, we propose an efficient algebraic unsuper vised method, EUGENE,that approximates GED and yields edit paths corresponding to the approx imatedcost, while eliminating the need for ground truth generation and data-specifictraining.

However, while decades of research andpublic discourse interrogated the risk of search systems in increasingselective exposure and creating echo chambers -- limiting exposure to diverseopinions and leading to opinion polarization, little is known about such a riskof LLM-powered conversational search. We conduct two experiments toinvestigate: 1) whether and how LLM-powered conversational search increasesselective exposure compared to conventional search; 2) whether and how LLMswith opinion biases that either reinforce or challenge the user's view changethe effect. Overall, we found that participants engaged in more biasedinformation querying with LLM-powered conversational search, and an opinionatedLLM reinforcing their views exacerbated this bias.

Consequently, formalizingthe sequential decision-making problems as inference has a considerable value,as probabilistic inference in principle offers diverse and powerfulmathematical tools to infer the stochastic dynamics whilst suggesting aprobabilistic interpretation of the reward design and policy convergence. Inthis study, we propose a novel Adaptive Wasserstein Variational Optimization(AWaVO) to tackle these challenges in sequential decision-making. Our approachutilizes formal methods to provide interpretations of reward design,transparency of training convergence, and probabilistic interpretation ofsequential decisions. To demonstrate practicality, we show convergent trainingwith guaranteed global convergence rates not only in simulation but also inreal robot tasks, and empirically verify a reasonable tradeoff between highperformance and conservative interpretability.</description><author>Yanran Wang, David Boyle</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 18:09:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07084v2</guid></item><item><title>Federated Offline Reinforcement Learning: Collaborative Single-Policy Coverage Suffices</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05876v1</link><description>Offline reinforcement learning (RL), which seeks to learn an optimal policyusing offline data, has garnered significant interest due to its potential incritical applications where online data collection is infeasible or expensive.This work explores the benefit of federated learning for offline RL, aiming atcollaboratively leveraging offline datasets at multiple agents.

The difficulty ofreliably capturing geometric context in existing methods impedes their abilityto accurately enforce the consistency between the different geometricproperties, thereby leading to a bottleneck of geometric estimation quality. Wetherefore propose the Adaptive Surface Normal (ASN) constraint, a simple yetefficient method. Our approach extracts geometric context that encodes thegeometric variations present in the input image and correlates depth estimationwith geometric constraints. By dynamically determining reliable local geometryfrom randomly sampled candidates, we establish a surface normal constraint,where the validity of these candidates is evaluated using the geometriccontext. Furthermore, our normal estimation leverages the geometric context toprioritize regions that exhibit significant geometric variations, which makesthe predicted normals accurately capture intricate and detailed geometricinformation. Through the integration of geometric context, our method unifiesdepth and surface normal estimations within a cohesive framework, which enablesthe generation of high-quality 3D geometry from images.

While these models offer substantial benefits in terms ofaccessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacyconcerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructurespose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitiveinformation; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLMservice provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventingindividuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services. To addressthese concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanismPromptCrypt to protect user privacy. It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputsbefore sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to humanor LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thusensuring the model's performance remains unaffected. We conduct experiments onthree tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular dataanalysis. Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personalinformation within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents thediscernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains oreven improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable oreven better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without promptencryption.

With rapidly growinginterest in using large language models (LLMs) to act as agents on behalf ofhuman users, such LLM agents would also need to be able to negotiate. In thispaper, we study how well LLMs can negotiate with each other. We developNegotiationArena: a flexible framework for evaluating and probing thenegotiation abilities of LLM agents. We implemented three types of scenarios inNegotiationArena to assess LLM's behaviors in allocating shared resources(ultimatum games), aggregate resources (trading games) and buy/sell goods(price negotiations). Each scenario allows for multiple turns of flexibledialogues between LLM agents to allow for more complex negotiations.Interestingly, LLM agents can significantly boost their negotiation outcomes byemploying certain behavioral tactics. For example, by pretending to be desolateand desperate, LLMs can improve their payoffs by 20\% when negotiating againstthe standard GPT-4. We also quantify irrational negotiation behaviors exhibitedby the LLM agents, many of which also appear in humans. Together,\NegotiationArena offers a new environment to investigate LLM interactions,enabling new insights into LLM's theory of mind, irrationality, and reasoningabilities.</description><author>Federico Bianchi, Patrick John Chia, Mert Yuksekgonul, Jacopo Tagliabue, Dan Jurafsky, James Zou</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 17:51:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05863v1</guid></item><item><title>Let Your Graph Do the Talking: Encoding Structured Data for LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05862v1</link><description>How can we best encode structured data into sequential form for use in largelanguage models (LLMs)?

To this end, we study hypothesistesting when there is an agent (e.g., a researcher or a pharmaceutical company)with a private prior about an unknown parameter and a principal (e.g., apolicymaker or regulator) who wishes to make decisions based on the parametervalue. The agent chooses whether to run a statistical trial based on theirprivate prior and then the result of the trial is used by the principal toreach a decision. We show how the principal can conduct statistical inferencethat leverages the information that is revealed by an agent's strategicbehavior -- their choice to run a trial or not.

However, in biological learning, DNNs cannot learnincremental tasks over time and exhibit catastrophic forgetting, which refersto the sharp decline in performance on previously learned tasks after learninga new one. Specifically, when data scarcity is the issue, the model shows arapid drop in performance on previously learned instruments after learning newdata with new instruments. The problem becomes worse when it limits releasingthe dataset of the old instruments for the old model due to privacy concernsand the unavailability of the data for the new or updated version of theinstruments for the continual learning model. For this purpose, we develop aprivacy-preserving synthetic continual semantic segmentation framework byblending and harmonizing (i) open-source old instruments foreground to thesynthesized background without revealing real patient data in public and (ii)new instruments foreground to extensively augmented real background. To boostthe balanced logit distillation from the old model to the continual learningmodel, we design overlapping class-aware temperature normalization (CAT) bycontrolling model learning utility. We also introduce multi-scaleshifted-feature distillation (SD) to maintain long and short-range spatialrelationships among the semantic objects where conventional short-range spatialfeatures with limited information reduce the power of feature distillation.

How can we recycle large collections of expertlanguage models to improve zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks? In thiswork, we propose Post-Hoc Adaptive Tokenwise Gating Over an Ocean ofSpecialized Experts (PHATGOOSE), which learns to route among specializedmodules that were produced through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Unlike pastmethods that learn to route among specialized models, PHATGOOSE explores thepossibility that zero-shot generalization will be improved if different expertscan be adaptively chosen for each token and at each layer in the model.Crucially, our method is post-hoc - it does not require simultaneous access tothe datasets used to create the specialized models and only requires a modestamount of additional compute after each expert model is trained. In experimentscovering a range of specialized model collections and zero-shot generalizationbenchmarks, we find that PHATGOOSE outperforms past methods for post-hocrouting and, in some cases, outperforms explicit multitask training (whichrequires simultaneous data access). To better understand the routing strategylearned by PHATGOOSE, we perform qualitative experiments to validate thatPHATGOOSE's performance stems from its ability to make adaptive per-token andper-module expert choices. We release all of our code to support future work onimproving zero-shot generalization by recycling specialized experts.</description><author>Mohammed Muqeeth, Haokun Liu, Yufan Liu, Colin Raffel</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 17:43:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05859v1</guid></item><item><title>Adaptive Experimental Design for Policy Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03756v3</link><description>Evidence-based targeting has been a topic of growing interest among thepractitioners of policy and business.

Whendata are collected from different sources with heterogeneous trends while stillsharing some congruency, it is critical to extract shared knowledge whileretaining the unique features of each source. To this end, we proposepersonalized PCA (PerPCA), which uses mutually orthogonal global and localprincipal components to encode both unique and shared features. We show that,under mild conditions, both unique and shared features can be identified andrecovered by a constrained optimization problem, even if the covariancematrices are immensely different. Also, we design a fully federated algorithminspired by distributed Stiefel gradient descent to solve the problem. Thealgorithm introduces a new group of operations called generalized retractionsto handle orthogonality constraints, and only requires global PCs to be sharedacross sources. We prove the linear convergence of the algorithm under suitableassumptions. Comprehensive numerical experiments highlight PerPCA's superiorperformance in feature extraction and prediction from heterogeneous datasets.As a systematic approach to decouple shared and unique features fromheterogeneous datasets, PerPCA finds applications in several tasks, includingvideo segmentation, topic extraction, and feature clustering.</description><author>Naichen Shi, Raed Al Kontar</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 17:35:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08041v2</guid></item><item><title>BGE M3-Embedding: Multi-Lingual, Multi-Functionality, Multi-Granularity Text Embeddings Through Self-Knowledge Distillation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03216v2</link><description>In this paper, we present a new embedding model, called M3-Embedding, whichis distinguished for its versatility in Multi-Linguality, Multi-Functionality,and Multi-Granularity.

A fundamental challengethat SAMS face is appropriate positioning of idle fleet vehicles to meet futuredemand - a problem that strongly impacts service quality and efficiency. Thispaper formulates SAMS fleet repositioning as a Markov Decision Process andpresents a reinforcement learning-based repositioning (RLR) approach calledintegrated system-agent repositioning (ISR). The ISR learns a scalable fleetrepositioning strategy in an integrated manner: learning to respond to evolvingdemand patterns without explicit demand forecasting and to cooperate withoptimization-based passenger-to-vehicle assignment. Numerical experiments areconducted using New York City taxi data and an agent-based simulation tool. TheISR is compared to an alternative RLR approach named externally guidedrepositioning (EGR) and a benchmark joint optimization (JO) forpassenger-to-vehicle assignment and repositioning. The results demonstrate theRLR approaches' substantial reductions in passenger wait times, over 50%,relative to the JO approach. The ISR's ability to bypass demand forecasting isalso demonstrated as it maintains comparable performance to EGR in terms ofaverage metrics. The results also demonstrate the model's transferability toevolving conditions, including unseen demand patterns, extended operationalperiods, and changes in the assignment strategy.</description><author>Monika Filipovska, Michael Hyland, Haimanti Bala</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 17:19:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08659v3</guid></item><item><title>Dirichlet Flow Matching with Applications to DNA Sequence Design</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05841v1</link><description>Discrete diffusion or flow models could enable faster and more controllablesequence generation than autoregressive models.

Bearing faults are primary contributors to machinevibrations, and analyzing their signal morphology offers insights into theirhealth status. Unfortunately, existing approaches are optimized for controlledenvironments, neglecting realistic conditions such as time-varying rotationalspeeds and the vibration's non-stationary nature. This paper presents a fusionof time-frequency analysis and deep learning techniques to diagnose bearingfaults under time-varying speeds and varying noise levels. First, we formulatethe bearing fault-induced vibrations and discuss the link between theirnon-stationarity and the bearing's inherent and operational parameters. We alsoelucidate quadratic time-frequency distributions and validate theireffectiveness in resolving distinctive dynamic patterns associated withdifferent bearing faults. Based on this, we design a time-frequencyconvolutional neural network (TF-CNN) to diagnose various faults inrolling-element bearings. Our experimental findings undeniably demonstrate thesuperior performance of TF-CNN in comparison to recently developed techniques.They also assert its versatility in capturing fault-relevant non-stationaryfeatures that couple with speed changes and show its exceptional resilience tonoise, consistently surpassing competing methods across various signal-to-noiseratios and performance metrics. Altogether, the TF-CNN achieves substantialaccuracy improvements up to 15%, in severe noise conditions.</description><author>Mohammad Al-Sa'd, Tuomas Jalonen, Serkan Kiranyaz, Moncef Gabbouj</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 17:14:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01172v2</guid></item><item><title>How Much is Unseen Depends Chiefly on Information About the Seen</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05835v1</link><description>It might seem counter-intuitive at first: We find that, in expectation, theproportion of data points in an unknown population-that belong to classes thatdo not appear in the training data-is almost entirely determined by the number$f_k$ of classes that do appear in the training data the same number of times.While in theory we show that the difference of the induced estimator decaysexponentially in the size of the sample, in practice the high variance preventsus from using it directly for an estimator of the sample coverage.

Hence, we turn to optimizationand develop a genetic algorithm that, given only the sample, searches for anestimator with minimal mean-squared error (MSE). In our experiments, ourgenetic algorithm discovers estimators that have a substantially smaller MSEthan the state-of-the-art Good-Turing estimator.

We outline twostructural reasons for why these models can fail when turned into agents.First, we discuss auto-suggestive delusions. Prior work has shown theoreticallythat models fail to imitate agents that generated the training data if theagents relied on hidden observations: the hidden observations act asconfounding variables, and the models treat actions they generate as evidencefor nonexistent observations. Second, we introduce and formally study arelated, novel limitation: predictor-policy incoherence. When a model generatesa sequence of actions, the model's implicit prediction of the policy thatgenerated those actions can serve as a confounding variable. The result is thatmodels choose actions as if they expect future actions to be suboptimal,causing them to be overly conservative. We show that both of those failures arefixed by including a feedback loop from the environment, that is, re-trainingthe models on their own actions. We give simple demonstrations of bothlimitations using Decision Transformers and confirm that empirical resultsagree with our conceptual and formal analysis. Our treatment provides aunifying view of those failure modes, and informs the question of whyfine-tuning offline learned policies with online learning makes them moreeffective.</description><author>Raymond Douglas, Jacek Karwowski, Chan Bae, Andis Draguns, Victoria Krakovna</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 17:08:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05829v1</guid></item><item><title>Discovering Temporally-Aware Reinforcement Learning Algorithms</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05828v1</link><description>Recent advancements in meta-learning have enabled the automatic discovery ofnovel reinforcement learning algorithms parameterized by surrogate objectivefunctions. To improve upon manually designed algorithms, the parameterizationof this learned objective function must be expressive enough to represent novelprinciples of learning (instead of merely recovering already established ones)while still generalizing to a wide range of settings outside of itsmeta-training distribution. However, existing methods focus on discoveringobjective functions that, like many widely used objective functions inreinforcement learning, do not take into account the total number of stepsallowed for training, or "training horizon". In contrast, humans use a plethoraof different learning objectives across the course of acquiring a new ability.For instance, students may alter their studying techniques based on theproximity to exam deadlines and their self-assessed capabilities. This papercontends that ignoring the optimization time horizon significantly restrictsthe expressive potential of discovered learning algorithms. We propose a simpleaugmentation to two existing objective discovery approaches that allows thediscovered algorithm to dynamically update its objective function throughoutthe agent's training procedure, resulting in expressive schedules and increasedgeneralization across different training horizons. In the process, we find thatcommonly used meta-gradient approaches fail to discover such adaptive objectivefunctions while evolution strategies discover highly dynamic learning rules. Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of tasks andanalyze the resulting learned algorithms, which we find effectively balanceexploration and exploitation by modifying the structure of their learning rulesthroughout the agent's lifetime.</description><author>Matthew Thomas Jackson, Chris Lu, Louis Kirsch, Robert Tjarko Lange, Shimon Whiteson, Jakob Nicolaus Foerster</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 17:07:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05828v1</guid></item><item><title>Is it Possible to Edit Large Language Models Robustly?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05827v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in buildingcommunicative AI to imitate human behaviors but face the challenge of efficientcustomization.

As originallyconceived by the psychometric community, MDS was concerned with embedding afixed set of proximities associated with a fixed set of objects. Modernconcerns, e.g., that arise in developing asymptotic theories for statisticalinference on random graphs, more typically involve studying the limitingbehavior of a sequence of proximities associated with an increasing set ofobjects. Standard results from the theory of point-to-set maps imply that, if$n$ is fixed and a sequence of proximities converges, then the limit of theembedded structures is the embedded structure of the limiting proximities.

Amongvarious ANNS algorithms, graph-based algorithms are known to achieve the bestthroughput-recall tradeoffs. Despite the large scale of modern ANNS datasets,existing parallel graph based implementations suffer from significantchallenges to scale to large datasets due to heavy use of locks and othersequential bottlenecks, which 1) prevents them from efficiently scaling to alarge number of processors, and 2) results in nondeterminism that isundesirable in certain applications. In this paper, we introduce ParlayANN, a library of deterministic andparallel graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms, along witha set of useful tools for developing such algorithms. In this library, wedevelop novel parallel implementations for four state-of-the-art graph-basedANNS algorithms that scale to billion-scale datasets.

We strengthen their result,and extend it to the case when their stylized distribution has labels withMassart noise instead of i.i.d. noise. We prove a similar recovery result forarbitrary data distributions using fair reject option classifiers. We furthergeneralize it to arbitrary data distributions and arbitrary hypothesis classes,i.e., we prove that for any data distribution, if the optimally accurateclassifier in a given hypothesis class is fair and robust, then it can berecovered through fair classification with equal opportunity constraints on thebiased distribution whenever the bias parameters satisfy certain simpleconditions. Finally, we show applications of our technique to time-varying databias in classification and fair machine learning pipelines.</description><author>Mohit Sharma, Amit Deshpande</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 16:58:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10396v3</guid></item><item><title>Integrating Self-supervised Speech Model with Pseudo Word-level Targets from Visually-grounded Speech Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05819v1</link><description>Recent advances in self-supervised speech models have shown significantimprovement in many downstream tasks. However, these models predominantlycentered on frame-level training objectives, which can fall short in spokenlanguage understanding tasks that require semantic comprehension. Existingworks often rely on additional speech-text data as intermediate targets, whichis costly in the real-world setting.

A total of 5657 MRI scansfor 1084 patients were retrieved. 326 patients with 1034 tumors recruited froma retrospective maintained database, and bounding boxes were drawn around theirtumors. A primary model was trained on 80% of annotated cases, with 20% savedfor testing (primary test set). The best primary model was then used toidentify tumors in the remaining 861 patients and bounding box coordinates weregenerated on their scans using the model. Ten benchmark training sets werecreated with generated coordinates on not-segmented patients. The final modelused to predict the kidney in the primary test set. We reported the positivepredictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and mean average precision (mAP). ResultsThe primary training set showed an average PPV of 0.94 +/- 0.01, sensitivity of0.87 +/- 0.04, and mAP of 0.91 +/- 0.02. The best primary model yielded a PPVof 0.97, sensitivity of 0.92, and mAP of 0.95. The final model demonstrated anaverage PPV of 0.95 +/- 0.03, sensitivity of 0.98 +/- 0.004, and mAP of 0.95+/- 0.01.

However, it traditionallyrequires repeatedly solving a computationally expensive reinforcement learning(RL) problem in its inner loop. It is desirable to reduce the explorationburden by leveraging expert demonstrations in the inner-loop RL. As an example,recent work resets the learner to expert states in order to inform the learnerof high-reward expert states. However, such an approach is infeasible in thereal world. In this work, we consider an alternative approach to speeding upthe RL subroutine in IRL: \emph{pessimism}, i.e., staying close to the expert'sdata distribution, instantiated via the use of offline RL algorithms. Weformalize a connection between offline RL and IRL, enabling us to use anarbitrary offline RL algorithm to improve the sample efficiency of IRL. Wevalidate our theory experimentally by demonstrating a strong correlationbetween the efficacy of an offline RL algorithm and how well it works as partof an IRL procedure. By using a strong offline RL algorithm as part of an IRLprocedure, we are able to find policies that match expert performancesignificantly more efficiently than the prior art.</description><author>David Wu, Gokul Swamy, J.

Most existing methods learnthe mapping function between low/normal-light images by Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) on sRGB and HSV color space. Nevertheless, enhancement involvesamplifying image signals, and applying these color spaces to low-light imageswith a low signal-to-noise ratio can introduce sensitivity and instability intothe enhancement process. Consequently, this results in the presence of colorartifacts and brightness artifacts in the enhanced images. To alleviate thisproblem, we propose a novel trainable color space, namedHorizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI). It not only decouples brightness and colorfrom RGB channels to mitigate the instability during enhancement but alsoadapts to low-light images in different illumination ranges due to thetrainable parameters. Further, we design a novel Color and Intensity DecouplingNetwork (CIDNet) with two branches dedicated to processing the decoupled imagebrightness and color in the HVI space. Within CIDNet, we introduce theLightweight Cross-Attention (LCA) module to facilitate interaction betweenimage structure and content information in both branches, while alsosuppressing noise in low-light images. Finally, we conducted 22 quantitativeand qualitative experiments to show that the proposed CIDNet outperforms thestate-of-the-art methods on 11 datasets.

The core challenge in applying RL to complex reasoning is toidentify a sequence of actions that result in positive rewards and provideappropriate supervision for optimization. Outcome supervision provides sparserewards for final results without identifying error locations, whereas processsupervision offers step-wise rewards but requires extensive manual annotation.R$^3$ overcomes these limitations by learning from correct demonstrations.Specifically, R$^3$ progressively slides the start state of reasoning from ademonstration's end to its beginning, facilitating easier model exploration atall stages. Thus, R$^3$ establishes a step-wise curriculum, allowing outcomesupervision to offer step-level signals and precisely pinpoint errors.

While in practice both types of indications canbe desired, so far the interplay between them has not been investigated. Towardfilling this gap, in this paper we study the effect of temperature scaling,arguably the most common calibration technique, on prominent CP methods. Westart with an extensive empirical study that among other insights shows that,surprisingly, calibration has a detrimental effect on popular adaptive CPmethods: it frequently leads to larger prediction sets. Then, we turn totheoretically analyze this behavior. We reveal several mathematical propertiesof the procedure, according to which we provide a reasoning for the phenomenon.Our study suggests that it may be worthwhile to utilize adaptive CP methods,chosen for their enhanced conditional coverage, based on softmax values priorto (or after canceling) temperature scaling calibration.</description><author>Lahav Dabah, Tom Tirer</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 16:45:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05806v1</guid></item><item><title>InkSight: Offline-to-Online Handwriting Conversion by Learning to Read and Write</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05804v1</link><description>Digital note-taking is gaining popularity, offering a durable, editable, andeasily indexable way of storing notes in the vectorized form, known as digitalink.

Most CIL methods focus on balanced datadistribution for each task, overlooking real-world long-tailed distributions.Therefore, Long-Tailed Class-Incremental Learning (LT-CIL) has been introduced,which trains on data where head classes have more samples than tail classes.Existing methods mainly focus on preserving representative samples fromprevious classes to combat catastrophic forgetting. Recently, dynamic networkalgorithms frozen old network structures and expanded new ones, achievingsignificant performance. However, with the introduction of the long-tailproblem, merely extending task-specific parameters can lead to miscalibratedpredictions, while expanding the entire model results in an explosion of memorysize. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Task-aware Expandable (TaE)framework, dynamically allocating and updating task-specific trainableparameters to learn diverse representations from each incremental task, whileresisting forgetting through the majority of frozen model parameters. Tofurther encourage the class-specific feature representation, we develop aCentroid-Enhanced (CEd) method to guide the update of these task-awareparameters. This approach is designed to adaptively minimize the distancesbetween intra-class features while simultaneously maximizing the distancesbetween inter-class features across all seen classes. The utility of thiscentroid-enhanced method extends to all "training from scratch" CIL algorithms.Extensive experiments were conducted on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet100 underdifferent settings, which demonstrates that TaE achieves state-of-the-artperformance.</description><author>Linjie Li, S.

Police officers, the most visible and contacted agents ofthe state, interact with the public more than 20 million times a year duringtraffic stops. Today, these interactions are regularly recorded by body-worncameras (BWCs), which are lauded as a means to enhance police accountabilityand improve police-public interactions. However, the timely analysis of theserecordings is hampered by a lack of reliable automated tools that can enablethe analysis of these complex and contested police-public interactions. Thisarticle proposes an approach to developing new multi-perspective, multimodalmachine learning (ML) tools to analyze the audio, video, and transcriptinformation from this BWC footage. Our approach begins by identifying theaspects of communication most salient to different stakeholders, including bothcommunity members and police officers. We move away from modeling approachesbuilt around the existence of a single ground truth and instead utilize newadvances in soft labeling to incorporate variation in how different observersperceive the same interactions. We argue that this inclusive approach to theconceptualization and design of new ML tools is broadly applicable to the studyof communication and development of analytic tools across domains of humaninteraction, including education, medicine, and the workplace.</description><author>Benjamin A.

Wealso present a theorem in complexity theory, showing that gradient descent onmemorizing feedforward models can be exponentially data inefficient.</description><author>Jonathan Thomm, Aleksandar Terzic, Geethan Karunaratne, Giacomo Camposampiero, Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf, Abbas Rahimi</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 16:23:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05785v1</guid></item><item><title>pFedMoE: Data-Level Personalization with Mixture of Experts for Model-Heterogeneous Personalized Federated Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01350v2</link><description>Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted for collaborative training ondecentralized data. However, it faces the challenges of data, system, and modelheterogeneity. This has inspired the emergence of model-heterogeneouspersonalized federated learning (MHPFL). Nevertheless, the problem of ensuringdata and model privacy, while achieving good model performance and keepingcommunication and computation costs low remains open in MHPFL. To address thisproblem, we propose a model-heterogeneous personalized Federated learning withMixture of Experts (pFedMoE) method. It assigns a shared homogeneous smallfeature extractor and a local gating network for each client's localheterogeneous large model. Firstly, during local training, the localheterogeneous model's feature extractor acts as a local expert for personalizedfeature (representation) extraction, while the shared homogeneous small featureextractor serves as a global expert for generalized feature extraction. Thelocal gating network produces personalized weights for extractedrepresentations from both experts on each data sample. The three models form alocal heterogeneous MoE. The weighted mixed representation fuses generalizedand personalized features and is processed by the local heterogeneous largemodel's header with personalized prediction information. The MoE and predictionheader are updated simultaneously. Secondly, the trained local homogeneoussmall feature extractors are sent to the server for cross-client informationfusion via aggregation. Overall, pFedMoE enhances local model personalizationat a fine-grained data level, while supporting model heterogeneity.</description><author>Liping Yi, Han Yu, Chao Ren, Heng Zhang, Gang Wang, Xiaoguang Liu, Xiaoxiao Li</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 16:22:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01350v2</guid></item><item><title>Trainable Transformer in Transformer</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01189v2</link><description>Recent works attribute the capability of in-context learning (ICL) in largepre-trained language models to implicitly simulating and fine-tuning aninternal model (e.g., linear or 2-layer MLP) during inference. However, suchconstructions require large memory overhead, which makes simulation of moresophisticated internal models intractable. In this work, we propose anefficient construction, Transformer in Transformer (in short, TinT), thatallows a transformer to simulate and fine-tune complex models internally duringinference (e.g., pre-trained language models). In particular, we introduceinnovative approximation techniques that allow a TinT model with less than 2billion parameters to simulate and fine-tune a 125 million parametertransformer model within a single forward pass. TinT accommodates many commontransformer variants and its design ideas also improve the efficiency of pastinstantiations of simple models inside transformers. We conduct end-to-endexperiments to validate the internal fine-tuning procedure of TinT on variouslanguage modeling and downstream tasks. For example, even with a limitedone-step budget, we observe TinT for a OPT-125M model improves performance by4-16% absolute on average compared to OPT-125M. These findings suggest thatlarge pre-trained language models are capable of performing intricatesubroutines. To facilitate further work, a modular and extensible codebase forTinT is included.</description><author>Abhishek Panigrahi, Sadhika Malladi, Mengzhou Xia, Sanjeev Arora</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 16:19:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01189v2</guid></item><item><title>Text-to-Code Generation with Modality-relative Pre-training</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05783v1</link><description>Large pre-trained language models have recently been expanded and applied toprogramming language tasks with great success, often through furtherpre-training of a strictly-natural language model--where training sequencestypically contain both natural and (linearised) programming language. Suchapproaches effectively map both modalities of the sequence into the sameembedding space. However, programming language keywords (e.g. ``while'') oftenhave very strictly defined semantics. As such, transfer learning from theirnatural language usage may not necessarily be beneficial to their codeapplication and vise versa. Assuming an already pre-trained language model, inthis work we investigate how sequence tokens can be adapted and representeddifferently, depending on which modality they belong to, and to the ultimatebenefit of the downstream task. We experiment with separating embedding spacesbetween modalities during further model pre-training with modality-relativetraining objectives. We focus on text-to-code generation and observe consistentimprovements across two backbone models and two test sets, measuring pass@$k$and a novel incremental variation.</description><author>Fenia Christopoulou, Guchun Zhang, Gerasimos Lampouras</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 16:17:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05783v1</guid></item><item><title>Analysing the Sample Complexity of Opponent Shaping</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05782v1</link><description>Learning in general-sum games often yields collectively sub-optimal results.Addressing this, opponent shaping (OS) methods actively guide the learningprocesses of other agents, empirically leading to improved individual and groupperformances in many settings. Early OS methods use higher-order derivatives toshape the learning of co-players, making them unsuitable for shaping multiplelearning steps. Follow-up work, Model-free Opponent Shaping (M-FOS), addressesthese by reframing the OS problem as a meta-game. In contrast to early OSmethods, there is little theoretical understanding of the M-FOS framework.Providing theoretical guarantees for M-FOS is hard because A) there is littleliterature on theoretical sample complexity bounds for meta-reinforcementlearning B) M-FOS operates in continuous state and action spaces, sotheoretical analysis is challenging. In this work, we present R-FOS, a tabularversion of M-FOS that is more suitable for theoretical analysis. R-FOSdiscretises the continuous meta-game MDP into a tabular MDP. Within thisdiscretised MDP, we adapt the $R_{max}$ algorithm, most prominently used toderive PAC-bounds for MDPs, as the meta-learner in the R-FOS algorithm. Wederive a sample complexity bound that is exponential in the cardinality of theinner state and action space and the number of agents. Our bound guaranteesthat, with high probability, the final policy learned by an R-FOS agent isclose to the optimal policy, apart from a constant factor. Finally, weinvestigate how R-FOS's sample complexity scales in the size of state-actionspace. Our theoretical results on scaling are supported empirically in theMatching Pennies environment.</description><author>Kitty Fung, Qizhen Zhang, Chris Lu, Jia Wan, Timon Willi, Jakob Foerster</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 16:17:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05782v1</guid></item><item><title>Examining Gender and Racial Bias in Large Vision-Language Models Using a Novel Dataset of Parallel Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05779v1</link><description>Following on recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and subsequentchat models, a new wave of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has emerged.Such models can incorporate images as input in addition to text, and performtasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, story generation,etc. Here, we examine potential gender and racial biases in such systems, basedon the perceived characteristics of the people in the input images. Toaccomplish this, we present a new dataset PAIRS (PArallel Images for eveRydayScenarios). The PAIRS dataset contains sets of AI-generated images of people,such that the images are highly similar in terms of background and visualcontent, but differ along the dimensions of gender (man, woman) and race(Black, white). By querying the LVLMs with such images, we observe significantdifferences in the responses according to the perceived gender or race of theperson depicted.</description><author>Kathleen C.

Accordingly, we propose an LLM-empoweredRumor Detection (LeRuD) approach, in which we design prompts to teach LLMs toreason over important clues in news and comments, and divide the entirepropagation information into a Chain-of-Propagation for reducing LLMs' burden.We conduct extensive experiments on the Twitter and Weibo datasets, and LeRuDoutperforms several state-of-the-art rumor detection models by 3.2% to 7.7%.Meanwhile, by applying LLMs, LeRuD requires no data for training, and thusshows more promising rumor detection ability in few-shot or zero-shotscenarios.</description><author>Qiang Liu, Xiang Tao, Junfei Wu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 16:09:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03916v2</guid></item><item><title>Survey of Federated Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Mobility Applications</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05257v4</link><description>Federated learning involves training statistical models over edge devicessuch as mobile phones such that the training data is kept local.

The problem is challenging in decentralized settings with robots thathave limited communication and sensing capabilities. We propose a learnablePerception-Action-Communication (LPAC) architecture for the problem, wherein aconvolution neural network (CNN) processes localized perception; a graph neuralnetwork (GNN) facilitates robot communications; finally, a shallow multi-layerperceptron (MLP) computes robot actions. The GNN enables collaboration in therobot swarm by computing what information to communicate with nearby robots andhow to incorporate received information. Evaluations show that the LPAC models-- trained using imitation learning -- outperform standard decentralized andcentralized coverage control algorithms. The learned policy generalizes toenvironments different from the training dataset, transfers to largerenvironments with more robots, and is robust to noisy position estimates. Theresults indicate the suitability of LPAC architectures for decentralizednavigation in robot swarms to achieve collaborative behavior.</description><author>Saurav Agarwal, Ramya Muthukrishnan, Walker Gosrich, Vijay Kumar, Alejandro Ribeiro</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 16:05:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04855v3</guid></item><item><title>Spectral Clustering with Variance Information for Group Structure Estimation in Panel Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01793v2</link><description>Consider a panel data setting where repeated observations on individuals areavailable.

In control theory, it is well-known that energy can serve as aneffective Lyapunov function. Despite this, connections between control theoryand generative models in the literature are sparse, even though there areseveral machine learning applications with physically stable data points. Inthis paper, we focus on such data and a recent class of deep generative modelscalled flow matching. We apply tools of stochastic stability fortime-independent systems to flow matching models.

To that end, for given generalized position andmomentum data, we propose a methodology to learn quadratic dynamical systems,enforcing the Hamiltonian structure in combination with a weakly-enforcedsymplectic auto-encoder. The obtained Hamiltonian structure exhibits long-termstability of the system, while the cubic Hamiltonian function providesrelatively low model complexity. For low-dimensional data, we determine ahigher-dimensional transformed coordinate system, whereas for high-dimensionaldata, we find a lower-dimensional coordinate system with the desiredproperties.

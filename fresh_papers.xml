Concurrently, significant progress has beenmade in multimodal representation learning for text and image data. This paperexplores a novel research direction that aims to connect the NeRF modality withother modalities, similar to established methodologies for images and text. Tothis end, we propose a simple framework that exploits pre-trained models forNeRF representations alongside multimodal models for text and image processing.Our framework learns a bidirectional mapping between NeRF embeddings and thoseobtained from corresponding images and text. This mapping unlocks several noveland useful applications, including NeRF zero-shot classification and NeRFretrieval from images or text.</description><author>Francesco Ballerini, Pierluigi Zama Ramirez, Roberto Mirabella, Samuele Salti, Luigi Di Stefano</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 18:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07993v1</guid></item><item><title>GoMVS: Geometrically Consistent Cost Aggregation for Multi-View Stereo</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07992v1</link><description>Matching cost aggregation plays a fundamental role in learning-basedmulti-view stereo networks. However, directly aggregating adjacent costs canlead to suboptimal results due to local geometric inconsistency. Relatedmethods either seek selective aggregation or improve aggregated depth in the 2Dspace, both are unable to handle geometric inconsistency in the cost volumeeffectively. In this paper, we propose GoMVS to aggregate geometricallyconsistent costs, yielding better utilization of adjacent geometries. Morespecifically, we correspond and propagate adjacent costs to the reference pixelby leveraging the local geometric smoothness in conjunction with surfacenormals. We achieve this by the geometric consistent propagation (GCP) module.It computes the correspondence from the adjacent depth hypothesis space to thereference depth space using surface normals, then uses the correspondence topropagate adjacent costs to the reference geometry, followed by a convolutionfor aggregation. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on DTU,Tanks &amp; Temple, and ETH3D datasets. Notably, our method ranks 1st on the Tanks&amp; Temple Advanced benchmark.</description><author>Jiang Wu, Rui Li, Haofei Xu, Wenxun Zhao, Yu Zhu, Jinqiu Sun, Yanning Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 18:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07992v1</guid></item><item><title>GoMAvatar: Efficient Animatable Human Modeling from Monocular Video Using Gaussians-on-Mesh</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07991v1</link><description>We introduce GoMAvatar, a novel approach for real-time, memory-efficient,high-quality animatable human modeling.

As these models see large-scale deployments,it is necessary to deeply investigate their safety and fairness to notdisseminate and perpetuate any kind of biases. However, existing works focus ondetecting closed sets of biases defined a priori, limiting the studies towell-known concepts. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of open-set biasdetection in text-to-image generative models presenting OpenBias, a newpipeline that identifies and quantifies the severity of biases agnostically,without access to any precompiled set. OpenBias has three stages. In the firstphase, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to propose biases given a setof captions. Secondly, the target generative model produces images using thesame set of captions. Lastly, a Vision Question Answering model recognizes thepresence and extent of the previously proposed biases. We study the behavior ofStable Diffusion 1.5, 2, and XL emphasizing new biases, never investigatedbefore. Via quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that OpenBias agrees withcurrent closed-set bias detection methods and human judgement.</description><author>Moreno D'Inc√†, Elia Peruzzo, Massimiliano Mancini, Dejia Xu, Vidit Goel, Xingqian Xu, Zhangyang Wang, Humphrey Shi, Nicu Sebe</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 18:59:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07990v1</guid></item><item><title>Any2Point: Empowering Any-modality Large Models for Efficient 3D Understanding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07989v1</link><description>Large foundation models have recently emerged as a prominent focus ofinterest, attaining superior performance in widespread scenarios. Due to thescarcity of 3D data, many efforts have been made to adapt pre-trainedtransformers from vision to 3D domains. However, such 2D-to-3D approaches arestill limited, due to the potential loss of spatial geometries and highcomputation cost. More importantly, their frameworks are mainly designed for 2Dmodels, lacking a general any-to-3D paradigm. In this paper, we introduceAny2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models(vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding. Given a frozen transformer fromany source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projectionstrategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positionswithin the source modality. This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D tokenwith a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3Dgeometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates thetransformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors. Then, within eachtransformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module forparameter-efficient fine-tuning. The adapter incorporates prior spatialknowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3Dtokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers. Weconduct extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency ofour method.

Subsequent efforts have been made tointroduce region-level visual learning into CLIP's pretraining but facescalability challenges due to the lack of large-scale region-level datasets.Drawing inspiration from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in natural languageprocessing such as instruction tuning, we explore the potential of fine-grainedSFT in enhancing the generation of vision foundation models after theirpretraining. Thus a two-stage method ViSFT (Vision SFT) is proposed to unleashthe fine-grained knowledge of vision foundation models. In ViSFT, the visionfoundation model is enhanced by performing visual joint learning on somein-domain tasks and then tested on out-of-domain benchmarks. With updatingusing ViSFT on 8 V100 GPUs in less than 2 days, a vision transformer with over4.4B parameters shows improvements across various out-of-domain benchmarksincluding vision and vision-linguistic scenarios.</description><author>Xiaohu Jiang, Yixiao Ge, Yuying Ge, Dachuan Shi, Chun Yuan, Ying Shan</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 18:59:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10222v2</guid></item><item><title>QuasiSim: Parameterized Quasi-Physical Simulators for Dexterous Manipulations Transfer</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07988v1</link><description>We explore the dexterous manipulation transfer problem by designingsimulators. The task wishes to transfer human manipulations to dexterous robothand simulations and is inherently difficult due to its intricate,highly-constrained, and discontinuous dynamics and the need to control adexterous hand with a DoF to accurately replicate human manipulations. Previousapproaches that optimize in high-fidelity black-box simulators or a modifiedone with relaxed constraints only demonstrate limited capabilities or arerestricted by insufficient simulation fidelity. We introduce parameterizedquasi-physical simulators and a physics curriculum to overcome theselimitations. The key ideas are 1) balancing between fidelity and optimizabilityof the simulation via a curriculum of parameterized simulators, and 2) solvingthe problem in each of the simulators from the curriculum, with propertiesranging from high task optimizability to high fidelity. We successfully enablea dexterous hand to track complex and diverse manipulations in high-fidelitysimulated environments, boosting the success rate by 11\%+ from thebest-performed baseline.

In thispaper, we reveal that existing methods still face significant challenges ingenerating images that align with the image conditional controls. To this end,we propose ControlNet++, a novel approach that improves controllable generationby explicitly optimizing pixel-level cycle consistency between generated imagesand conditional controls. Specifically, for an input conditional control, weuse a pre-trained discriminative reward model to extract the correspondingcondition of the generated images, and then optimize the consistency lossbetween the input conditional control and extracted condition. Astraightforward implementation would be generating images from random noisesand then calculating the consistency loss, but such an approach requiresstoring gradients for multiple sampling timesteps, leading to considerable timeand memory costs. To address this, we introduce an efficient reward strategythat deliberately disturbs the input images by adding noise, and then uses thesingle-step denoised images for reward fine-tuning. This avoids the extensivecosts associated with image sampling, allowing for more efficient rewardfine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that ControlNet++ significantlyimproves controllability under various conditional controls. For example, itachieves improvements over ControlNet by 7.9% mIoU, 13.4% SSIM, and 7.6% RMSE,respectively, for segmentation mask, line-art edge, and depth conditions.</description><author>Ming Li, Taojiannan Yang, Huafeng Kuang, Jie Wu, Zhaoning Wang, Xuefeng Xiao, Chen Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 18:59:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07987v1</guid></item><item><title>BAMBOO: a predictive and transferable machine learning force field framework for liquid electrolyte development</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07181v2</link><description>Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force field (MLFF) onsolids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to complexliquid electrolytes. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (ByteDance AI MolecularSimulation Booster), a novel framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,with a demonstration of its capabilities in the context of liquid electrolytesfor lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivarianttransformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantummechanical simulations. Additionally, we pioneer an ensemble knowledgedistillation approach and apply it on MLFFs to improve the stability of MDsimulations. Finally, we propose the density alignment algorithm to alignBAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-artaccuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity,and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. Ourcurrent model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the averagedensity error of 0.01 g/cm$^3$ on various compositions compared withexperimental data. Moreover, our model demonstrates transferability tomolecules not included in the quantum mechanical dataset.

A promising strategy toovercome this challenge is wavefront modulation, which induces measurementdiversity during image acquisition. Despite its importance, designing optimalwavefront modulations to image through scattering remains under-explored. Thispaper introduces a novel learning-based framework to address the gap. Ourapproach jointly optimizes wavefront modulations and a computationallylightweight feedforward "proxy" reconstruction network. This network is trainedto recover scenes obscured by scattering, using measurements that are modifiedby these modulations. The learned modulations produced by our frameworkgeneralize effectively to unseen scattering scenarios and exhibit remarkableversatility. During deployment, the learned modulations can be decoupled fromthe proxy network to augment other more computationally expensive restorationalgorithms. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our approachsignificantly advances the state of the art in imaging through scatteringmedia.

However, existingmethods sometimes lead to the generation of hallucinated captions, compromisingcaption quality. This paper explores the issue of hallucination in 3D objectcaptioning, with a focus on Cap3D method, which renders 3D objects into 2Dviews for captioning using pre-trained models. We pinpoint a major challenge:certain rendered views of 3D objects are atypical, deviating from the trainingdata of standard image captioning models and causing hallucinations. To tacklethis, we present DiffuRank, a method that leverages a pre-trained text-to-3Dmodel to assess the alignment between 3D objects and their 2D rendered views,where the view with high alignment closely represent the object'scharacteristics. By ranking all rendered views and feeding the top-ranked onesinto GPT4-Vision, we enhance the accuracy and detail of captions, enabling thecorrection of 200k captions in the Cap3D dataset and extending it to 1 millioncaptions across Objaverse and Objaverse-XL datasets. Additionally, we showcasethe adaptability of DiffuRank by applying it to pre-trained text-to-imagemodels for a Visual Question Answering task, where it outperforms the CLIPmodel.</description><author>Tiange Luo, Justin Johnson, Honglak Lee</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 18:58:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07984v1</guid></item><item><title>Two Effects, One Trigger: On the Modality Gap, Object Bias, and Information Imbalance in Contrastive Vision-Language Representation Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07983v1</link><description>Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP have gained popularity for theirversatile applicable learned representations in various downstream tasks.Despite their successes in some tasks, like zero-shot image recognition, theyalso perform surprisingly poor on other tasks, like attribute detection.Previous work has attributed these challenges to the modality gap, a separationof image and text in the shared representation space, and a bias towardsobjects over other factors, such as attributes. In this work we investigateboth phenomena. We find that only a few embedding dimensions drive the modalitygap. Further, we propose a measure for object bias and find that object biasdoes not lead to worse performance on other concepts, such as attributes. Butwhat leads to the emergence of the modality gap and object bias? To answer thisquestion we carefully designed an experimental setting which allows us tocontrol the amount of shared information between the modalities. This revealedthat the driving factor behind both, the modality gap and the object bias, isthe information imbalance between images and captions.</description><author>Simon Schrodi, David T.

To maintain high performance whilerepresenting multiple languages, multilingual models ideally alignrepresentations, allowing what is learned in one language to generalise toothers. Prior research has emphasised the importance of parallel data andshared vocabulary elements as key factors for such alignment. In this study, weinvestigate an unintuitive novel driver of cross-lingual generalisation:language imbalance. In controlled experiments on perfectly equivalent clonedlanguages, we observe that the existence of a predominant language duringtraining boosts the performance of less frequent languages and leads tostronger alignment of model representations across languages. Furthermore, wefind that this trend is amplified with scale: with large enough models or longenough training, we observe that bilingual training data with a 90/10 languagesplit yields better performance on both languages than a balanced 50/50 split.Building on these insights, we design training schemes that can improveperformance in all cloned languages, even without altering the training data.As we extend our analysis to real languages, we find that infrequent languagesstill benefit from frequent ones, yet whether language imbalance causescross-lingual generalisation there is not conclusive.</description><author>Anton Sch√§fer, Shauli Ravfogel, Thomas Hofmann, Tiago Pimentel, Imanol Schlag</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 18:58:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07982v1</guid></item><item><title>Manipulating Large Language Models to Increase Product Visibility</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07981v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into searchengines to provide natural language responses tailored to user queries.Customers and end-users are also becoming more dependent on these models forquick and easy purchase decisions. In this work, we investigate whetherrecommendations from LLMs can be manipulated to enhance a product's visibility.We demonstrate that adding a strategic text sequence (STS) -- a carefullycrafted message -- to a product's information page can significantly increaseits likelihood of being listed as the LLM's top recommendation. To understandthe impact of STS, we use a catalog of fictitious coffee machines and analyzeits effect on two target products: one that seldom appears in the LLM'srecommendations and another that usually ranks second. We observe that thestrategic text sequence significantly enhances the visibility of both productsby increasing their chances of appearing as the top recommendation. Thisability to manipulate LLM-generated search responses provides vendors with aconsiderable competitive advantage and has the potential to disrupt fair marketcompetition. Just as search engine optimization (SEO) revolutionized howwebpages are customized to rank higher in search engine results, influencingLLM recommendations could profoundly impact content optimization for AI-drivensearch services.

Weintroduce LLoCO, a technique that combines context compression, retrieval, andparameter-efficient finetuning using LoRA. Our approach extends the effectivecontext window of a 4k token LLaMA2-7B model to handle up to 128k tokens. Weevaluate our approach on several long-context question-answering datasets,demonstrating that LLoCO significantly outperforms in-context learning whileusing $30\times$ fewer tokens during inference. LLoCO achieves up to$7.62\times$ speed-up and substantially reduces the cost of long documentquestion answering, making it a promising solution for efficient long contextprocessing.

Previous studies have predominantlyconcentrated on aligning the intermediate statistics between the original anddistilled data, such as weight trajectory, features, gradient, BatchNorm, etc.In this work, we consider addressing this task through the new lens of modelinformativeness in the compression stage on the original dataset pretraining.We observe that with the prior state-of-the-art SRe$^2$L, as model sizesincrease, it becomes increasingly challenging for supervised pretrained modelsto recover learned information during data synthesis, as the channel-wise meanand variance inside the model are flatting and less informative. We furthernotice that larger variances in BN statistics from self-supervised modelsenable larger loss signals to update the recovered data by gradients, enjoyingmore informativeness during synthesis.

Challenging this norm, weposit that "Not all tokens in a corpus are equally important for language modeltraining". Our initial analysis delves into token-level training dynamics oflanguage model, revealing distinct loss patterns for different tokens.Leveraging these insights, we introduce a new language model called Rho-1.Unlike traditional LMs that learn to predict every next token in a corpus,Rho-1 employs Selective Language Modeling (SLM), which selectively trains onuseful tokens that aligned with the desired distribution. This approachinvolves scoring pretraining tokens using a reference model, and then trainingthe language model with a focused loss on tokens with higher excess loss. Whencontinual pretraining on 15B OpenWebMath corpus, Rho-1 yields an absoluteimprovement in few-shot accuracy of up to 30% in 9 math tasks. Afterfine-tuning, Rho-1-1B and 7B achieved state-of-the-art results of 40.6% and51.8% on MATH dataset, respectively - matching DeepSeekMath with only 3% of thepretraining tokens. Furthermore, when pretraining on 80B general tokens, Rho-1achieves 6.8% average enhancement across 15 diverse tasks, increasing bothefficiency and performance of the language model pre-training.</description><author>Zhenghao Lin, Zhibin Gou, Yeyun Gong, Xiao Liu, Yelong Shen, Ruochen Xu, Chen Lin, Yujiu Yang, Jian Jiao, Nan Duan, Weizhu Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 18:52:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07965v1</guid></item><item><title>Lyapunov-stable Neural Control for State and Output Feedback: A Novel Formulation for Efficient Synthesis and Verification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07956v1</link><description>Learning-based neural network (NN) control policies have shown impressiveempirical performance in a wide range of tasks in robotics and control.However, formal (Lyapunov) stability guarantees over the region-of-attraction(ROA) for NN controllers with nonlinear dynamical systems are challenging toobtain, and most existing approaches rely on expensive solvers such assums-of-squares (SOS), mixed-integer programming (MIP), or satisfiabilitymodulo theories (SMT). In this paper, we demonstrate a new framework forlearning NN controllers together with Lyapunov certificates using fastempirical falsification and strategic regularizations. We propose a novelformulation that defines a larger verifiable region-of-attraction (ROA) thanshown in the literature, and refines the conventional restrictive constraintson Lyapunov derivatives to focus only on certifiable ROAs. The Lyapunovcondition is rigorously verified post-hoc using branch-and-bound with scalablelinear bound propagation-based NN verification techniques. The approach isefficient and flexible, and the full training and verification procedure isaccelerated on GPUs without relying on expensive solvers for SOS, MIP, nor SMT.The flexibility and efficiency of our framework allow us to demonstrateLyapunov-stable output feedback control with synthesized NN-based controllersand NN-based observers with formal stability guarantees, for the first time inliterature.

To this end, we propose a unified framework called UniPCR tocomplete developer-based request quality assurance (i.e., predicting requestnecessity and recommending tags subtask) under a Masked Language Model (MLM).Specifically, we reformulate both subtasks via 1) text prompt tuning, whichconverts two subtasks into MLM by constructing prompt templates using hardprompt; 2) code prefix tuning, which optimizes a small segment of generatedcontinuous vectors as the prefix of the code representation using soft prompt.Experimental results on the Public Code Review dataset for the time span2011-2022 demonstrate that our UniPCR framework adapts to the two subtasks andoutperforms comparable accuracy-based results with state-of-the-art methods forrequest quality assurance.

We showthat four geometric measures of the activity determine performance acrosstasks. Using this theory, we find that experimentally observed disentangledrepresentations naturally emerge as an optimal solution to the multi-tasklearning problem. When data is scarce, these optimal neural codes compress lessinformative latent variables, and when data is abundant, they expand thesevariables in the state space.

Research on Goal Recognition asPlanning encompasses reasoning about the model of a planning task, theobservations, and the goals using planning techniques, resulting in veryefficient recognition approaches. In this article, we design novel recognitionapproaches that rely on the Operator-Counting framework, proposing newconstraints, and analyze their constraints' properties both theoretically andempirically. The Operator-Counting framework is a technique that efficientlycomputes heuristic estimates of cost-to-goal using Integer/Linear Programming(IP/LP). In the realm of theory, we prove that the new constraints providelower bounds on the cost of plans that comply with observations. We alsoprovide an extensive empirical evaluation to assess how the new constraintsimprove the quality of the solution, and we found that they are especiallyinformed in deciding which goals are unlikely to be part of the solution. Ournovel recognition approaches have two pivotal advantages: first, they employnew IP/LP constraints for efficiently recognizing goals; second, we show howthe new IP/LP constraints can improve the recognition of goals under bothpartial and noisy observability.</description><author>Felipe Meneguzzi, Lu√≠sa R. de A.

While classicalapproaches and, more recently, depth map predictions only focus on the visibleparts of a scene, the task of scene completion aims to reason about geometryeven in occluded regions. With the popularity of neural radiance fields(NeRFs), implicit representations also became popular for scene completion bypredicting so-called density fields. Unlike explicit approaches. e.g.voxel-based methods, density fields also allow for accurate depth predictionand novel-view synthesis via image-based rendering. In this work, we propose tofuse the scene reconstruction from multiple images and distill this knowledgeinto a more accurate single-view scene reconstruction. To this end, we proposeMulti-View Behind the Scenes (MVBTS) to fuse density fields from multiple posedimages, trained fully self-supervised only from image data.

Current deep learning(DL)-based methods for image fusion primarily rely on CNNs or Transformers toextract features and merge different types of data. While CNNs are efficient,their receptive fields are limited, restricting their capacity to captureglobal context. Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global informationbut are hindered by their quadratic complexity. Fortunately, recentadvancements in the State Space Model (SSM), particularly Mamba, offer apromising solution to this issue by enabling global awareness with linearcomplexity. However, there have been few attempts to explore the potential ofSSM in information fusion, which is a crucial ability in domains like imagefusion. Therefore, we propose FusionMamba, an innovative method for efficientimage fusion. Our contributions mainly focus on two aspects. Firstly,recognizing that images from different sources possess distinct properties, weincorporate Mamba blocks into two U-shaped networks, presenting a novelarchitecture that extracts spatial and spectral features in an efficient,independent, and hierarchical manner. Secondly, to effectively combine spatialand spectral information, we extend the Mamba block to accommodate dual inputs.This expansion leads to the creation of a new module called the FusionMambablock, which outperforms existing fusion techniques such as concatenation andcross-attention. To validate FusionMamba's effectiveness, we conduct a seriesof experiments on five datasets related to three image fusion tasks. Thequantitative and qualitative evaluation results demonstrate that our methodachieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, underscoring the superiority ofFusionMamba.</description><author>Siran Peng, Xiangyu Zhu, Haoyu Deng, Zhen Lei, Liang-Jian Deng</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 18:29:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07932v1</guid></item><item><title>Parameter Hierarchical Optimization for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07930v1</link><description>Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-reID) aims at matchingcross-modality pedestrian images captured by disjoint visible or infraredcameras.

Different from availablemethods, in this paper, we propose a novel parameter optimizing paradigm,parameter hierarchical optimization (PHO) method, for the task of VI-ReID. Itallows part of parameters to be directly optimized without any training, whichnarrows the search space of parameters and makes the whole network more easierto be trained. Specifically, we first divide the parameters into differenttypes, and then introduce a self-adaptive alignment strategy (SAS) toautomatically align the visible and infrared images through transformation.Considering that features in different dimension have varying importance, wedevelop an auto-weighted alignment learning (AAL) module that can automaticallyweight features according to their importance. Importantly, in the alignmentprocess of SAS and AAL, all the parameters are immediately optimized withoptimization principles rather than training the whole network, which yields abetter parameter training manner. Furthermore, we establish the cross-modalityconsistent learning (CCL) loss to extract discriminative person representationswith translation consistency.

To summarize, our work amplifies the impactof GCG by training a generative model of adversarial suffixes that is universalto any harmful queries and transferable from attacking open-source LLMs toclosed-source LLMs. In addition, it can generate 200 adversarial suffixes forone harmful query in only 4 seconds, rendering it more challenging to defend.</description><author>Zeyi Liao, Huan Sun</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 18:05:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07921v1</guid></item><item><title>Low-rank Adaptation for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07919v1</link><description>Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in real-world dynamic systems,predicting future changes using historical data from diverse locations.Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networksto capture the complex dependencies of the data, yet their accuracy fails toshow sustained improvement.

Psychologists havedocumented several ways in which humans' inferences deviate from the rules oflogic. Do language models, which are trained on text generated by humans,replicate such human biases, or are they able to overcome them? Focusing on thecase of syllogisms -- inferences from two simple premises -- we show that,within the PaLM2 family of transformer language models, larger models are morelogical than smaller ones, and also more logical than humans. At the same time,even the largest models make systematic errors, some of which mirror humanreasoning biases: they show sensitivity to the (irrelevant) ordering of thevariables in the syllogism, and draw confident but incorrect inferences fromparticular syllogisms (syllogistic fallacies). Overall, we find that languagemodels often mimic the human biases included in their training data, but areable to overcome them in some cases.</description><author>Tiwalayo Eisape, MH Tessler, Ishita Dasgupta, Fei Sha, Sjoerd van Steenkiste, Tal Linzen</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 17:49:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00445v2</guid></item><item><title>Low-Resource Vision Challenges for Foundation Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04716v3</link><description>Low-resource settings are well-established in natural language processing,where many languages lack sufficient data for deep learning at scale. However,low-resource problems are under-explored in computer vision. In this paper, weaddress this gap and explore the challenges of low-resource image tasks withvision foundation models. We first collect a benchmark of genuinelylow-resource image data, covering historic maps, circuit diagrams, andmechanical drawings. These low-resource settings all share three challenges:data scarcity, fine-grained differences, and the distribution shift fromnatural images to the specialized domain of interest. While existing foundationmodels have shown impressive generalizability, we find they cannot transferwell to our low-resource tasks. To begin to tackle the challenges oflow-resource vision, we introduce one simple baseline per challenge.Specifically, we i) enlarge the data space by generative models, ii) adopt thebest sub-kernels to encode local regions for fine-grained difference discoveryand iii) learn attention for specialized domains. Experiments on our threelow-resource tasks demonstrate our proposals already provide a better baselinethan transfer learning, data augmentation, and fine-grained methods. Thishighlights the unique characteristics and challenges of low-resource vision forfoundation models that warrant further investigation.

Learning itemsare tagged with skill labels called knowledge concepts (KCs). Many KT modelsexpand the sequence of item-student interactions into KC-student interactionsby replacing learning items with their constituting KCs. This often results ina longer sequence length. This approach addresses the issue of sparseitem-student interactions and minimises model parameters. However, two problemshave been identified with such models. The first problem is the model's ability to learn correlations between KCsbelonging to the same item, which can result in the leakage of ground truthlabels and hinder performance. This problem can lead to a significant decreasein performance on datasets with a higher number of KCs per item. The secondproblem is that the available benchmark implementations ignore accounting forchanges in sequence length when expanding KCs, leading to different modelsbeing tested with varying sequence lengths but still compared against the samebenchmark. To address these problems, we introduce a general masking framework thatmitigates the first problem and enhances the performance of such KT modelswhile preserving the original model architecture without significantalterations. Additionally, we introduce KTbench, an open-source benchmarklibrary designed to ensure the reproducibility of this work while mitigatingthe second problem.</description><author>Yahya Badran, Christine Preisach</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 17:39:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15304v2</guid></item><item><title>High-Dimension Human Value Representation in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07900v1</link><description>The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) across varioustasks and fields has necessitated the alignment of these models with humanvalues and preferences.

In this paper, we aim to solve a real-time anomaly detectionproblem. Given time-series measurement values coming from a fixed set ofsensors on the grid, can we identify anomalies in the network topology ormeasurement data? Existing methods, primarily optimization-based, mostly useonly a single snapshot of the measurement values and do not scale well with thenetwork size. Recent data-driven ML techniques have shown promise by using acombination of current and historical data for anomaly detection but generallydo not consider physical attributes like the impact of topology orload/generation changes on sensor measurements and thus cannot accommodateregular context-variability in the historical data. To address this gap, wepropose a novel context-aware anomaly detection algorithm, GridCAL, thatconsiders the effect of regular topology and load/generation changes. Thisalgorithm converts the real-time power flow measurements to context-agnosticvalues, which allows us to analyze measurement coming from different gridcontexts in an aggregate fashion, enabling us to derive a unified statisticalmodel that becomes the basis of anomaly detection.

This immersive perspective brings dramatic visual changes andunique challenges compared to third-person views. Synthetic data has empoweredthird-person-view vision models, but its application to embodied egocentricperception tasks remains largely unexplored. A critical challenge lies insimulating natural human movements and behaviors that effectively steer theembodied cameras to capture a faithful egocentric representation of the 3Dworld. To address this challenge, we introduce EgoGen, a new synthetic datagenerator that can produce accurate and rich ground-truth training data foregocentric perception tasks. At the heart of EgoGen is a novel human motionsynthesis model that directly leverages egocentric visual inputs of a virtualhuman to sense the 3D environment. Combined with collision-avoiding motionprimitives and a two-stage reinforcement learning approach, our motionsynthesis model offers a closed-loop solution where the embodied perception andmovement of the virtual human are seamlessly coupled. Compared to previousworks, our model eliminates the need for a pre-defined global path, and isdirectly applicable to dynamic environments. Combined with our easy-to-use andscalable data generation pipeline, we demonstrate EgoGen's efficacy in threetasks: mapping and localization for head-mounted cameras, egocentric cameratracking, and human mesh recovery from egocentric views. EgoGen will be fullyopen-sourced, offering a practical solution for creating realistic egocentrictraining data and aiming to serve as a useful tool for egocentric computervision research.

Here, the idea is toreduce the variance of the low-sample CATE estimation by a (potentiallyconstrained) low-dimensional representation. However, low-dimensionalrepresentations can lose information about the observed confounders and thuslead to bias, because of which the validity of representation learning for CATEestimation is typically violated. In this paper, we propose a new,representation-agnostic refutation framework for estimating bounds on therepresentation-induced confounding bias that comes from dimensionalityreduction (or other constraints on the representations) in CATE estimation.First, we establish theoretically under which conditions CATE isnon-identifiable given low-dimensional (constrained) representations. Second,as our remedy, we propose a neural refutation framework which performs partialidentification of CATE or, equivalently, aims at estimating lower and upperbounds of the representation-induced confounding bias. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of our bounds in a series of experiments. In sum, our refutationframework is of direct relevance in practice where the validity of CATEestimation is of importance.</description><author>Valentyn Melnychuk, Dennis Frauen, Stefan Feuerriegel</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 17:32:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11321v2</guid></item><item><title>SE(3)-Stochastic Flow Matching for Protein Backbone Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02391v4</link><description>The computational design of novel protein structures has the potential toimpact numerous scientific disciplines greatly.

To illustrate this mechanism, we study the simple setting of vanillagradient descent on a polynomial regression problem with a two layer neuralnetwork which exhibits grokking without regularization in a way that cannot beexplained by existing theories. We identify sufficient statistics for the testloss of such a network, and tracking these over training reveals that grokkingarises in this setting when the network first attempts to fit a kernelregression solution with its initial features, followed by late-time featurelearning where a generalizing solution is identified after train loss isalready low. We find that the key determinants of grokking are the rate offeature learning -- which can be controlled precisely by parameters that scalethe network output -- and the alignment of the initial features with the targetfunction $y(x)$. We argue this delayed generalization arises when (1) the topeigenvectors of the initial neural tangent kernel and the task labels $y(x)$are misaligned, but (2) the dataset size is large enough so that it is possiblefor the network to generalize eventually, but not so large that train lossperfectly tracks test loss at all epochs, and (3) the network begins trainingin the lazy regime so does not learn features immediately. We conclude withevidence that this transition from lazy (linear model) to rich training(feature learning) can control grokking in more general settings, like onMNIST, one-layer Transformers, and student-teacher networks.</description><author>Tanishq Kumar, Blake Bordelon, Samuel J.

We introduce CAVIAR, a novel method for embeddingcategorical variables that assume values in a high-dimensional ambient spacebut are sampled from an underlying manifold. Our theoretical and numericalanalyses outline challenges posed by such categorical variables in causalinference. Specifically, dynamically varying and sparse levels can lead toviolations of the Donsker conditions and a failure of the estimationfunctionals to converge to a tight Gaussian process. Traditional approaches,including the exclusion of rare categorical levels and principled variableselection models like LASSO, fall short.

One of social media'smain draws is its anonymity, allowing users to share their thoughts andopinions without fear of judgment or retribution. This anonymity has also madesocial media prone to harmful content, which requires moderation to ensureresponsible and productive use. Several methods using artificial intelligencehave been employed to detect harmful content. However, conversation andcontextual analysis of hate speech are still understudied. Most promising worksonly analyze a single text at a time rather than the conversation supportingit. In this work, we employ a tree-based approach to understand how usersbehave concerning toxicity in public conversation settings. To this end, wecollect both the posts and the comment sections of the top 100 posts from 8Reddit communities that allow profanity, totaling over 1 million responses. Wefind that toxic comments increase the likelihood of subsequent toxic commentsbeing produced in online conversations. Our analysis also shows that immediatecontext plays a vital role in shaping a response rather than the original post.We also study the effect of consensual profanity and observe overlappingsimilarities with non-consensual profanity in terms of user behavior andpatterns.</description><author>Vigneshwaran Shankaran, Rajesh Sharma</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 17:10:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07879v1</guid></item><item><title>FedADMM-InSa: An Inexact and Self-Adaptive ADMM for Federated Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13989v2</link><description>Federated learning (FL) is a promising framework for learning fromdistributed data while maintaining privacy. The development of efficient FLalgorithms encounters various challenges, including heterogeneous data andsystems, limited communication capacities, and constrained local computationalresources. Recently developed FedADMM methods show great resilience to bothdata and system heterogeneity. However, they still suffer from performancedeterioration if the hyperparameters are not carefully tuned. To address thisissue, we propose an inexact and self-adaptive FedADMM algorithm, termedFedADMM-InSa. First, we design an inexactness criterion for the clients' localupdates to eliminate the need for empirically setting the local trainingaccuracy. This inexactness criterion can be assessed by each clientindependently based on its unique condition, thereby reducing the localcomputational cost and mitigating the undesirable straggle effect. Theconvergence of the resulting inexact ADMM is proved under the assumption ofstrongly convex loss functions. Additionally, we present a self-adaptive schemethat dynamically adjusts each client's penalty parameter, enhancing algorithmrobustness by mitigating the need for empirical penalty parameter choices foreach client. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-worlddatasets are conducted. As validated by some numerical tests, our proposedalgorithm can reduce the clients' local computational load significantly andalso accelerate the learning process compared to the vanilla FedADMM.</description><author>Yongcun Song, Ziqi Wang, Enrique Zuazua</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 17:07:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13989v2</guid></item><item><title>MambaAD: Exploring State Space Models for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06564v2</link><description>Recent advancements in anomaly detection have seen the efficacy of CNN- andtransformer-based approaches.

Mamba-based models, with their superior long-range modeling andlinear efficiency, have garnered substantial attention. This study pioneers theapplication of Mamba to multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection, presentingMambaAD, which consists of a pre-trained encoder and a Mamba decoder featuring(Locality-Enhanced State Space) LSS modules at multi-scales. The proposed LSSmodule, integrating parallel cascaded (Hybrid State Space) HSS blocks andmulti-kernel convolutions operations, effectively captures both long-range andlocal information. The HSS block, utilizing (Hybrid Scanning) HS encoders,encodes feature maps into five scanning methods and eight directions, therebystrengthening global connections through the (State Space Model) SSM. The useof Hilbert scanning and eight directions significantly improves featuresequence modeling.

State-of-the-art classification performance is onlyreached by end-to-end trained neural networks. Nevertheless, such black-boxmodels lack transparency in their decision-making processes, prompting effortsto ascertain the rules that underlie classifiers' decisions. Analyzing singleinputs alone fails to expose systematic learned biases. These biases can becharacterized as facial properties summarizing abstract information like age ormedical conditions. Therefore, understanding a model's prediction behaviorrequires an analysis rooted in causality along such selected properties. Wedemonstrate that up to 91.25% of classifier output behavior changes arestatistically significant concerning basic properties. Among those are age,gender, and facial symmetry. Furthermore, the medical usage of surfaceelectromyography significantly influences emotion prediction. We introduce aworkflow to evaluate explicit properties and their impact.

However, disruptions in public transport such asdelays may negatively affect mobility choices. To quantify delays, aggregateddata from vehicle locations systems are frequently used. However, delaysobserved at individual stops are caused inter alia by fluctuations in runningtimes and propagation of delays occurring in other locations. Hence, in thiswork, we propose both the method detecting significant delays and referencearchitecture, relying on stream processing engines, in which the method isimplemented. The method can complement the calculation of delays defined asdeviation from schedules. This provides both online rather than batchidentification of significant and repetitive delays, and resilience to thelimited quality of location data. The method we propose can be used withdifferent change detectors, such as ADWIN, applied to location data streamshuffled to individual edges of a transport graph. It can detect in an onlinemanner at which edges statistically significant delays are observed and atwhich edges delays arise and are reduced. Detections can be used to modelmobility choices and quantify the impact of repetitive rather than randomdisruptions on feasible trips with multimodal trip modelling engines.

Existing rPPG methods utilize multiple datasets for training toenhance the generalizability of models. However, they often overlook theunderlying conflict issues across different datasets, such as (1) labelconflict resulting from different phase delays between physiological signallabels and face videos at the instance level, and (2) attribute conflictstemming from distribution shifts caused by head movements, illuminationchanges, skin types, etc. To address this, we introduce the DOmain-HArmoniousframework (DOHA).

Currently, brain decoding is confined to aper-subject-per-model paradigm, limiting its applicability to the sameindividual for whom the decoding model is trained. This constraint stems fromthree key challenges: 1) the inherent variability in input dimensions acrosssubjects due to differences in brain size; 2) the unique intrinsic neuralpatterns, influencing how different individuals perceive and process sensoryinformation; 3) limited data availability for new subjects in real-worldscenarios hampers the performance of decoding models. In this paper, we presenta novel approach, MindBridge, that achieves cross-subject brain decoding byemploying only one model. Our proposed framework establishes a generic paradigmcapable of addressing these challenges by introducing biological-inspiredaggregation function and novel cyclic fMRI reconstruction mechanism forsubject-invariant representation learning. Notably, by cycle reconstruction offMRI, MindBridge can enable novel fMRI synthesis, which also can serve aspseudo data augmentation. Within the framework, we also devise a novelreset-tuning method for adapting a pretrained model to a new subject.Experimental results demonstrate MindBridge's ability to reconstruct images formultiple subjects, which is competitive with dedicated subject-specific models.Furthermore, with limited data for a new subject, we achieve a high level ofdecoding accuracy, surpassing that of subject-specific models. This advancementin cross-subject brain decoding suggests promising directions for widerapplications in neuroscience and indicates potential for more efficientutilization of limited fMRI data in real-world scenarios.

The aim is to support recognition of the concepts whenpartial information about the concepts is presented, and also when some of theneurons in the network might fail. Our failure model involves initial randomfailures. The three types of networks are: feed-forward networks with highconnectivity, feed-forward networks with low connectivity, and layered networkswith low connectivity and with both forward edges and "lateral" edges withinlayers. In order to achieve fault-tolerance, the representations all usemultiple representative neurons for each concept. We show how recognition canwork in all three of these settings, and quantify how the probability ofcorrect recognition depends on several parameters, including the number ofrepresentatives and the neuron failure probability. We also discuss how theserepresentations might be learned, in all three types of networks. For thefeed-forward networks, the learning algorithms are similar to ones used in [4],whereas for networks with lateral edges, the algorithms are generally inspiredby work on the assembly calculus [3, 6, 7].</description><author>Nancy A.

Existing BSNs are mostly conducted withconvolution layers. Although transformers offer potential solutions to thelimitations of convolutions and have demonstrated success in various imagerestoration tasks, their attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spotrequirement, thus restricting their applicability in SSID. In this paper, wepresent a transformer-based blind-spot network (TBSN) by analyzing andredesigning the transformer operators that meet the blind-spot requirement.Specifically, TBSN follows the architectural principles of dilated BSNs, andincorporates spatial as well as channel self-attention layers to enhance thenetwork capability. For spatial self-attention, an elaborate mask is applied tothe attention matrix to restrict its receptive field, thus mimicking thedilated convolution. For channel self-attention, we observe that it may leakthe blind-spot information when the channel number is greater than spatial sizein the deep layers of multi-scale architectures. To eliminate this effect, wedivide the channel into several groups and perform channel attentionseparately. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy thatdistills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency whilemaintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoisingdatasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibitsfavorable performance against state-of-the-art SSID methods.

This gap can be attributed to thelack of methodologies for constructing VLMs and the absence of benchmarks toaccurately measure their performance. To address this issue, we introduce anovel benchmark, Japanese Heron-Bench, for evaluating Japanese capabilities ofVLMs. The Japanese Heron-Bench consists of a variety of imagequestion answerpairs tailored to the Japanese context. Additionally, we present a baselineJapanese VLM that has been trained with Japanese visual instruction tuningdatasets. Our Heron-Bench reveals the strengths and limitations of the proposedVLM across various ability dimensions. Furthermore, we clarify the capabilitygap between strong closed models like GPT-4V and the baseline model, providingvaluable insights for future research in this domain. We release the benchmarkdataset and training code to facilitate further developments in Japanese VLMresearch.</description><author>Yuichi Inoue, Kento Sasaki, Yuma Ochi, Kazuki Fujii, Kotaro Tanahashi, Yu Yamaguchi</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 16:09:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07824v1</guid></item><item><title>Sparse Laneformer</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07821v1</link><description>Lane detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving, and has achievedgreat progress as deep learning emerges. Previous anchor-based methods oftendesign dense anchors, which highly depend on the training dataset and remainfixed during inference. We analyze that dense anchors are not necessary forlane detection, and propose a transformer-based lane detection framework basedon a sparse anchor mechanism. To this end, we generate sparse anchors withposition-aware lane queries and angle queries instead of traditional explicitanchors. We adopt Horizontal Perceptual Attention (HPA) to aggregate the lanefeatures along the horizontal direction, and adopt Lane-Angle Cross Attention(LACA) to perform interactions between lane queries and angle queries. We alsopropose Lane Perceptual Attention (LPA) based on deformable cross attention tofurther refine the lane predictions. Our method, named Sparse Laneformer, iseasy-to-implement and end-to-end trainable. Extensive experiments demonstratethat Sparse Laneformer performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods,e.g., surpassing Laneformer by 3.0% F1 score and O2SFormer by 0.7% F1 scorewith fewer MACs on CULane with the same ResNet-34 backbone.</description><author>Ji Liu, Zifeng Zhang, Mingjie Lu, Hongyang Wei, Dong Li, Yile Xie, Jinzhang Peng, Lu Tian, Ashish Sirasao, Emad Barsoum</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 16:00:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07821v1</guid></item><item><title>Novelty Heuristics, Multi-Queue Search, and Portfolios for Numeric Planning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05235v2</link><description>Heuristic search is a powerful approach for solving planning problems andnumeric planning is no exception.

Unfortunately, CL models tend toforget previous knowledge, thus often underperforming when compared with anoffline model trained jointly on the entire data stream. Given that any CLmodel will eventually make mistakes, it is of crucial importance to buildcalibrated CL models: models that can reliably tell their confidence whenmaking a prediction. Model calibration is an active research topic in machinelearning, yet to be properly investigated in CL. We provide the first empiricalstudy of the behavior of calibration approaches in CL, showing that CLstrategies do not inherently learn calibrated models. To mitigate this issue,we design a continual calibration approach that improves the performance ofpost-processing calibration methods over a wide range of different benchmarksand CL strategies. CL does not necessarily need perfect predictive models, butrather it can benefit from reliable predictive models. We believe our study oncontinual calibration represents a first step towards this direction.</description><author>Lanpei Li, Elia Piccoli, Andrea Cossu, Davide Bacciu, Vincenzo Lomonaco</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 15:59:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07817v1</guid></item><item><title>Group Decision-Making among Privacy-Aware Agents</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08156v4</link><description>How can individuals exchange information to learn from each other despitetheir privacy needs and security concerns? For example, consider individualsdeliberating a contentious topic and being concerned about divulging theirprivate experiences. Preserving individual privacy and enabling efficientsocial learning are both important desiderata but seem fundamentally at oddswith each other and very hard to reconcile. We do so by controlling informationleakage using rigorous statistical guarantees that are based on differentialprivacy (DP). Our agents use log-linear rules to update their beliefs aftercommunicating with their neighbors. Adding DP randomization noise to beliefsprovides communicating agents with plausible deniability with regard to theirprivate information and their network neighborhoods. We consider two learningenvironments one for distributed maximum-likelihood estimation given a finitenumber of private signals and another for online learning from an infinite,intermittent signal stream. Noisy information aggregation in the finite caseleads to interesting tradeoffs between rejecting low-quality states and makingsure all high-quality states are accepted in the algorithm output. Our resultsflesh out the nature of the trade-offs in both cases between the quality of thegroup decision outcomes, learning accuracy, communication cost, and the levelof privacy protections that the agents are afforded.</description><author>Marios Papachristou, M.

In this paper, we challenge this practice with anextensive empirical study. In particular, we demonstrate a phenomenon that wecall post-hoc reversal, where performance trends are reversed after applyingthese post-hoc transforms. This phenomenon is especially prominent inhigh-noise settings. For example, while base models overfit badly early intraining, both conventional ensembling and SWA favor base models trained formore epochs. Post-hoc reversal can also suppress the appearance of doubledescent and mitigate mismatches between test loss and test error seen in basemodels. Based on our findings, we propose post-hoc selection, a simpletechnique whereby post-hoc metrics inform model development decisions such asearly stopping, checkpointing, and broader hyperparameter choices. Ourexperimental analyses span real-world vision, language, tabular and graphdatasets from domains like satellite imaging, language modeling, censusprediction and social network analysis.

Comprising 178K tokens from 50 modern and contemporary novels,KoCoNovel stands as one of the largest public coreference resolution corpora inKorean, and the first to be based on literary texts. KoCoNovel offers fourdistinct versions to accommodate a wide range of literary coreference analysisneeds.

One of KoCoNovel'sdistinctive features is that 24% of all character mentions are single commonnouns, lacking possessive markers or articles. This feature is particularlyinfluenced by the nuances of Korean address term culture, which favors the useof terms denoting social relationships and kinship over personal names.

Thus,comprehension of traffic signs is essential for road safety and ignorance mayresult in road accidents. Traffic sign detection has been a research spotlightover the past few decades. Real-time and accurate detections are thepreliminaries of robust traffic sign detection system which is yet to beachieved. This study presents a voice-assisted real-time traffic signrecognition system which is capable of assisting drivers. This system functionsunder two subsystems. Initially, the detection and recognition of the trafficsigns are carried out using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Afterrecognizing the specific traffic sign, it is narrated to the driver as a voicemessage using a text-to-speech engine. An efficient CNN model for a benchmarkdataset is developed for real-time detection and recognition using DeepLearning techniques. The advantage of this system is that even if the drivermisses a traffic sign, or does not look at the traffic sign, or is unable tocomprehend the sign, the system detects it and narrates it to the driver. Asystem of this type is also important in the development of autonomousvehicles.</description><author>Mayura Manawadu, Udaya Wijenayake</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 15:51:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07807v1</guid></item><item><title>Wu's Method can Boost Symbolic AI to Rival Silver Medalists and AlphaGeometry to Outperform Gold Medalists at IMO Geometry</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06405v2</link><description>Proving geometric theorems constitutes a hallmark of visual reasoningcombining both intuitive and logical skills. Therefore, automated theoremproving of Olympiad-level geometry problems is considered a notable milestonein human-level automated reasoning. The introduction of AlphaGeometry, aneuro-symbolic model trained with 100 million synthetic samples, marked a majorbreakthrough. It solved 25 of 30 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)problems whereas the reported baseline based on Wu's method solved only ten. Inthis note, we revisit the IMO-AG-30 Challenge introduced with AlphaGeometry,and find that Wu's method is surprisingly strong. Wu's method alone can solve15 problems, and some of them are not solved by any of the other methods. Thisleads to two key findings: (i) Combining Wu's method with the classic syntheticmethods of deductive databases and angle, ratio, and distance chasing solves 21out of 30 methods by just using a CPU-only laptop with a time limit of 5minutes per problem. Essentially, this classic method solves just 4 problemsless than AlphaGeometry and establishes the first fully symbolic baselinestrong enough to rival the performance of an IMO silver medalist. (ii) Wu'smethod even solves 2 of the 5 problems that AlphaGeometry failed to solve.Thus, by combining AlphaGeometry with Wu's method we set a new state-of-the-artfor automated theorem proving on IMO-AG-30, solving 27 out of 30 problems, thefirst AI method which outperforms an IMO gold medalist.</description><author>Shiven Sinha, Ameya Prabhu, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Siddharth Bhat, Matthias Bethge</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 15:37:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06405v2</guid></item><item><title>DGMamba: Domain Generalization via Generalized State Space Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07794v1</link><description>Domain generalization~(DG) aims at solving distribution shift problems invarious scenes. Existing approaches are based on Convolution Neural Networks(CNNs) or Vision Transformers (ViTs), which suffer from limited receptivefields or quadratic complexities issues. Mamba, as an emerging state spacemodel (SSM), possesses superior linear complexity and global receptive fields.Despite this, it can hardly be applied to DG to address distribution shifts,due to the hidden state issues and inappropriate scan mechanisms. In thispaper, we propose a novel framework for DG, named DGMamba, that excels instrong generalizability toward unseen domains and meanwhile has the advantagesof global receptive fields, and efficient linear complexity. Our DGMambacompromises two core components: Hidden State Suppressing~(HSS) andSemantic-aware Patch refining~(SPR). In particular, HSS is introduced tomitigate the influence of hidden states associated with domain-specificfeatures during output prediction. SPR strives to encourage the model toconcentrate more on objects rather than context, consisting of two designs:Prior-Free Scanning~(PFS), and Domain Context Interchange~(DCI). Concretely,PFS aims to shuffle the non-semantic patches within images, creating moreflexible and effective sequences from images, and DCI is designed to regularizeMamba with the combination of mismatched non-semantic and semantic informationby fusing patches among domains. Extensive experiments on four commonly used DGbenchmarks demonstrate that the proposed DGMamba achieves remarkably superiorresults to state-of-the-art models. The code will be made publicly available.</description><author>Shaocong Long, Qianyu Zhou, Xiangtai Li, Xuequan Lu, Chenhao Ying, Yuan Luo, Lizhuang Ma, Shuicheng Yan</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 15:35:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07794v1</guid></item><item><title>Nostra Domina at EvaLatin 2024: Improving Latin Polarity Detection through Data Augmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07792v1</link><description>This paper describes submissions from the team Nostra Domina to the EvaLatin2024 shared task of emotion polarity detection.

The infrared image exhibits robustness to the haze,however, existing methods have primarily treated the infrared modality asauxiliary information, failing to fully explore its rich information indehazing. To address this challenge, the key insight of this study is to designa visible-infrared fusion network for image dehazing. In particular, we proposea multi-scale Deep Structure Feature Extraction (DSFE) module, whichincorporates the Channel-Pixel Attention Block (CPAB) to restore more spatialand marginal information within the deep structural features. Additionally, weintroduce an inconsistency weighted fusion strategy to merge the two modalitiesby leveraging the more reliable information. To validate this, we construct avisible-infrared multimodal dataset called AirSim-VID based on the AirSimsimulation platform.

Until now, lots of SGG datasetswith the eyelevel view are released but the SGG dataset with the overhead viewis scarcely studied. By contrast to the object occlusion problem in theeyelevel view, which impedes the SGG, the overhead view provides a newperspective that helps to promote the SGG by providing a clear perception ofthe spatial relationships of objects in the ground scene. To fill in the gap ofthe overhead view dataset, this paper constructs and releases an aerial imageurban scene graph generation (AUG) dataset. Images from the AUG dataset arecaptured with the low-attitude overhead view. In the AUG dataset, 25,594objects, 16,970 relationships, and 27,175 attributes are manually annotated. Toavoid the local context being overwhelmed in the complex aerial urban scene,this paper proposes one new locality-preserving graph convolutional network(LPG). Different from the traditional graph convolutional network, which hasthe natural advantage of capturing the global context for SGG, theconvolutional layer in the LPG integrates the non-destructive initial featuresof the objects with dynamically updated neighborhood information to preservethe local context under the premise of mining the global context. To addressthe problem that there exists an extra-large number of potential objectrelationship pairs but only a small part of them is meaningful in AUG, wepropose the adaptive bounding box scaling factor for potential relationshipdetection (ABS-PRD) to intelligently prune the meaningless relationship pairs.Extensive experiments on the AUG dataset show that our LPG can significantlyoutperform the state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of the proposedlocality-preserving strategy.</description><author>Yansheng Li, Kun Li, Yongjun Zhang, Linlin Wang, Dingwen Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 15:29:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07788v1</guid></item><item><title>PRAM: Place Recognition Anywhere Model for Efficient Visual Localization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07785v1</link><description>Humans localize themselves efficiently in known environments by firstrecognizing landmarks defined on certain objects and their spatialrelationships, and then verifying the location by aligning detailed structuresof recognized objects with those in the memory. Inspired by this, we proposethe place recognition anywhere model (PRAM) to perform visual localization asefficiently as humans do. PRAM consists of two main components - recognitionand registration. In detail, first of all, a self-supervised map-centriclandmark definition strategy is adopted, making places in either indoor oroutdoor scenes act as unique landmarks. Then, sparse keypoints extracted fromimages, are utilized as the input to a transformer-based deep neural networkfor landmark recognition; these keypoints enable PRAM to recognize hundreds oflandmarks with high time and memory efficiency. Keypoints along with recognizedlandmark labels are further used for registration between query images and the3D landmark map. Different from previous hierarchical methods, PRAM discardsglobal and local descriptors, and reduces over 90% storage. Since PRAM utilizesrecognition and landmark-wise verification to replace global reference searchand exhaustive matching respectively, it runs 2.4 times faster than priorstate-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, PRAM opens new directions for visuallocalization including multi-modality localization, map-centric featurelearning, and hierarchical scene coordinate regression.</description><author>Fei Xue, Ignas Budvytis, Roberto Cipolla</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 15:28:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07785v1</guid></item><item><title>Diffusion Time-step Curriculum for One Image to 3D Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04562v2</link><description>Score distillation sampling~(SDS) has been widely adopted to overcome theabsence of unseen views in reconstructing 3D objects from a \textbf{single}image.

However, the existingstudies on MAEs in RS assume that the considered RS images are acquired by asingle image sensor, and thus are only suitable for uni-modal CBIR problems.The effectiveness of MAEs for cross-sensor CBIR, which aims to searchsemantically similar images across different image modalities, has not beenexplored yet. In this paper, we take the first step to explore theeffectiveness of MAEs for sensor-agnostic CBIR in RS. To this end, we present asystematic overview on the possible adaptations of the vanilla MAE to exploitmasked image modeling on multi-sensor RS image archives (denoted ascross-sensor masked autoencoders [CSMAEs]). Based on different adjustmentsapplied to the vanilla MAE, we introduce different CSMAE models. We alsoprovide an extensive experimental analysis of these CSMAE models. We finallyderive a guideline to exploit masked image modeling for uni-modal andcross-modal CBIR problems in RS.

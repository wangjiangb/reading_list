Whileclassical algorithms can achieve excellent accuracy, they solve atime-consuming optimization for every image pair. Deep-learning (DL) methodslearn a function that maps an image pair to an output transform. Evaluating thefunction is fast, but capturing large transforms can be challenging, andnetworks tend to struggle if a test-image characteristic shifts from thetraining domain, such as resolution. Most affine methods are agnostic toanatomy, meaning the registration will be inaccurate if algorithms consider allstructures in the image. We address these shortcomings with SynthMorph, an easy-to-use DL tool forjoint affine-deformable registration of any brain image without preprocessing,right off the MRI scanner. First, we leverage a strategy to train networks withwildly varying images synthesized from label maps, yielding robust performanceacross acquisition specifics unseen at training. Second, we optimize thespatial overlap of select anatomical labels. This enables networks todistinguish anatomy of interest from irrelevant structures, removing the needfor preprocessing that excludes content which would impinge on anatomy-specificregistration. Third, we combine the affine model with a deformable hypernetworkthat lets users choose the optimal deformation-field regularity for theirspecific data, at registration time, in a fraction of the time required byclassical methods. We rigorously analyze how competing architectures learn affine transforms andcompare state-of-the-art registration tools across an extremely diverse set ofneuroimaging data, aiming to truly capture the behavior of methods in the realworld. SynthMorph demonstrates consistent and improved accuracy.

However, adaptingthese models for downstream tasks while maintaining their generalizationremains a challenge. In literature, one branch of methods adapts CLIP bylearning prompts using visual information. While effective, most of these worksrequire labeled data which is not practical, and often struggle to generalizetowards new datasets due to over-fitting on the source data. An alternativeapproach resorts to training-free methods by generating class descriptions fromlarge language models (LLMs) and perform prompt ensembling. However, thesemethods often generate class specific prompts that cannot be transferred toother classes, which incur higher costs by generating LLM descriptions for eachclass separately. In this work, we propose to combine the strengths of theseboth streams of methods by learning prompts using only text data derived fromLLMs. As supervised training of prompts is not trivial due to absence ofimages, we develop a training approach that allows prompts to extract richcontextual knowledge from LLM data. Moreover, with LLM contextual data mappedwithin the learned prompts, it enables zero-shot transfer of prompts to newclasses and datasets potentially cutting the LLM prompt engineering cost. Tothe best of our knowledge, this is the first work that learns generalizedprompts using text only data. We perform extensive evaluations on 4 benchmarkswhere our method improves over prior ensembling works while being competitiveto those utilizing labeled images.

Existing assistant systems collectlarge numbers of these unsuccessful interactions, but these systems usuallyfail to learn from these interactions, even in an offline fashion. In thiswork, we introduce CLC: Contrastive Learning for Conversations, a family ofmethods for contrastive fine-tuning of models in a self-supervised fashion,making use of easily detectable artifacts in unsuccessful conversations withassistants. We demonstrate that our CLC family of approaches can improve theperformance of ASR models on OD3, a new public large-scale semi-syntheticmeta-dataset of audio task-oriented dialogues, by up to 19.2%. These gainstransfer to real-world systems as well, where we show that CLC can help toimprove performance by up to 6.7% over baselines.

They are typically trainedin-domain, forego large-scale 2D pre-training and outperform alternatives thatfeaturize the posed RGB-D multiview images instead. The gap in performancebetween methods that consume posed images versus post-processed 3D point cloudshas fueled the belief that 2D and 3D perception require distinct modelarchitectures. In this paper, we challenge this view and propose ODIN(Omni-Dimensional INstance segmentation), a model that can segment and labelboth 2D RGB images and 3D point clouds, using a transformer architecture thatalternates between 2D within-view and 3D cross-view information fusion. Ourmodel differentiates 2D and 3D feature operations through the positionalencodings of the tokens involved, which capture pixel coordinates for 2D patchtokens and 3D coordinates for 3D feature tokens. ODIN achieves state-of-the-artperformance on ScanNet200, Matterport3D and AI2THOR 3D instance segmentationbenchmarks, and competitive performance on ScanNet, S3DIS and COCO. Itoutperforms all previous works by a wide margin when the sensed 3D point cloudis used in place of the point cloud sampled from 3D mesh. When used as the 3Dperception engine in an instructable embodied agent architecture, it sets a newstate-of-the-art on the TEACh action-from-dialogue benchmark.

To this end, we propose a new post-pretraining method for LLMs withan expansion of Transformer blocks. We tune the expanded blocks using only newcorpus, efficiently and effectively improving the model's knowledge withoutcatastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we experiment on the corpus of code andmath, yielding LLaMA Pro-8.3B, a versatile foundation model initialized fromLLaMA2-7B, excelling in general tasks, programming, and mathematics. LLaMA Proand its instruction-following counterpart (LLaMA Pro-Instruct) achieve advancedperformance among various benchmarks, demonstrating superiority over existingopen models in the LLaMA family and the immense potential of reasoning andaddressing diverse tasks as an intelligent agent.

Notable applications include the diagnosis ofapproximate MCMC samplers and goodness-of-fit tests for unnormalizedstatistical models. The present work analyzes the convergence controlproperties of KSDs. We first show that standard KSDs used for weak convergencecontrol fail to control moment convergence. To address this limitation, we nextprovide sufficient conditions under which alternative diffusion KSDs controlboth moment and weak convergence. As an immediate consequence we develop, foreach $q &gt; 0$, the first KSDs known to exactly characterize $q$-Wassersteinconvergence.</description><author>Heishiro Kanagawa, Alessandro Barp, Arthur Gretton, Lester Mackey</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 18:55:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05408v2</guid></item><item><title>Bring Metric Functions into Diffusion Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02414v1</link><description>We introduce a Cascaded Diffusion Model (Cas-DM) that improves a DenoisingDiffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) by effectively incorporating additionalmetric functions in training. Metric functions such as the LPIPS loss have beenproven highly effective in consistency models derived from the score matching.However, for the diffusion counterparts, the methodology and efficacy of addingextra metric functions remain unclear. One major challenge is the mismatchbetween the noise predicted by a DDPM at each step and the desired clean imagethat the metric function works well on. To address this problem, we proposeCas-DM, a network architecture that cascades two network modules to effectivelyapply metric functions to the diffusion model training. The first module,similar to a standard DDPM, learns to predict the added noise and is unaffectedby the metric function. The second cascaded module learns to predict the cleanimage, thereby facilitating the metric function computation. Experiment resultsshow that the proposed diffusion model backbone enables the effective use ofthe LPIPS loss, leading to state-of-the-art image quality (FID, sFID, IS) onvarious established benchmarks.</description><author>Jie An, Zhengyuan Yang, Jianfeng Wang, Linjie Li, Zicheng Liu, Lijuan Wang, Jiebo Luo</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 18:55:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02414v1</guid></item><item><title>Simulation-Based Inference with Quantile Regression</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02413v1</link><description>We present Neural Quantile Estimation (NQE), a novel Simulation-BasedInference (SBI) method based on conditional quantile regression. NQEautoregressively learns individual one dimensional quantiles for each posteriordimension, conditioned on the data and previous posterior dimensions. Posteriorsamples are obtained by interpolating the predicted quantiles using monotoniccubic Hermite spline, with specific treatment for the tail behavior andmulti-modal distributions. We introduce an alternative definition for theBayesian credible region using the local Cumulative Density Function (CDF),offering substantially faster evaluation than the traditional Highest PosteriorDensity Region (HPDR). In case of limited simulation budget and/or known modelmisspecification, a post-processing broadening step can be integrated into NQEto ensure the unbiasedness of the posterior estimation with negligibleadditional computational cost. We demonstrate that the proposed NQE methodachieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmark problems.</description><author>He Jia</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 18:53:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02413v1</guid></item><item><title>LLM Augmented LLMs: Expanding Capabilities through Composition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02412v1</link><description>Foundational models with billions of parameters which have been trained onlarge corpora of data have demonstrated non-trivial skills in a variety ofdomains. However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging andexpensive to augment them or impart new skills. On the other hand, due to theiradaptation abilities, several new instances of these models are being trainedtowards new domains and tasks. In this work, we study the problem of efficientand practical composition of existing foundation models with more specificmodels to enable newer capabilities. To this end, we propose CALM --Composition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attentionbetween models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities.Salient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using'existing LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existingmodel weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and(iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings. We illustrate that augmentingPaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in anabsolute improvement of up to 13\% on tasks like translation into English andarithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages. Similarly, when PaLM2-S isaugmented with a code-specific model, we see a relative improvement of 40\%over the base model for code generation and explanation tasks -- on-par withfully fine-tuned counterparts.</description><author>Rachit Bansal, Bidisha Samanta, Siddharth Dalmia, Nitish Gupta, Shikhar Vashishth, Sriram Ganapathy, Abhishek Bapna, Prateek Jain, Partha Talukdar</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 18:53:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02412v1</guid></item><item><title>What You See is What You GAN: Rendering Every Pixel for High-Fidelity Geometry in 3D GANs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02411v1</link><description>3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkableprogress in learning to generate multi-view-consistent images and 3D geometriesof scenes from collections of 2D images via neural volume rendering. Yet, thesignificant memory and computational costs of dense sampling in volumerendering have forced 3D GANs to adopt patch-based training or employlow-resolution rendering with post-processing 2D super resolution, whichsacrifices multiview consistency and the quality of resolved geometry.Consequently, 3D GANs have not yet been able to fully resolve the rich 3Dgeometry present in 2D images. In this work, we propose techniques to scaleneural volume rendering to the much higher resolution of native 2D images,thereby resolving fine-grained 3D geometry with unprecedented detail. Ourapproach employs learning-based samplers for accelerating neural rendering for3D GAN training using up to 5 times fewer depth samples. This enables us toexplicitly "render every pixel" of the full-resolution image during trainingand inference without post-processing superresolution in 2D. Together with ourstrategy to learn high-quality surface geometry, our method synthesizeshigh-resolution 3D geometry and strictly view-consistent images whilemaintaining image quality on par with baselines relying on post-processingsuper resolution. We demonstrate state-of-the-art 3D gemetric quality on FFHQand AFHQ, setting a new standard for unsupervised learning of 3D shapes in 3DGANs.</description><author>Alex Trevithick, Matthew Chan, Towaki Takikawa, Umar Iqbal, Shalini De Mello, Manmohan Chandraker, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Koki Nagano</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 18:50:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02411v1</guid></item><item><title>Evaluating Language-Model Agents on Realistic Autonomous Tasks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11671v2</link><description>In this report, we explore the ability of language model agents to acquireresources, create copies of themselves, and adapt to novel challenges theyencounter in the wild. We refer to this cluster of capabilities as "autonomousreplication and adaptation" or ARA. We believe that systems capable of ARAcould have wide-reaching and hard-to-anticipate consequences, and thatmeasuring and forecasting ARA may be useful for informing measures aroundsecurity, monitoring, and alignment. Additionally, once a system is capable ofARA, placing bounds on a system's capabilities may become significantly moredifficult. We construct four simple example agents that combine language models withtools that allow them to take actions in the world. We then evaluate theseagents on 12 tasks relevant to ARA. We find that these language model agentscan only complete the easiest tasks from this list, although they make someprogress on the more challenging tasks. Unfortunately, these evaluations arenot adequate to rule out the possibility that near-future agents will becapable of ARA. In particular, we do not think that these evaluations providegood assurance that the ``next generation'' of language models (e.g. 100xeffective compute scaleup on existing models) will not yield agents capable ofARA, unless intermediate evaluations are performed during pretraining.Relatedly, we expect that fine-tuning of the existing models could producesubstantially more competent agents, even if the fine-tuning is not directlytargeted at ARA.</description><author>Megan Kinniment, Lucas Jun Koba Sato, Haoxing Du, Brian Goodrich, Max Hasin, Lawrence Chan, Luke Harold Miles, Tao R.

However,it tends to get impractical for high-dimensional problems due to the size ofthe inherent correlation matrix and the associated high-dimensionalhyper-parameter tuning problem. To address these issues, a new method, calledsliced GE-Kriging (SGE-Kriging), is developed in this paper for reducing boththe size of the correlation matrix and the number of hyper-parameters. We firstsplit the training sample set into multiple slices, and invoke Bayes' theoremto approximate the full likelihood function via a sliced likelihood function,in which multiple small correlation matrices are utilized to describe thecorrelation of the sample set rather than one large one. Then, we replace theoriginal high-dimensional hyper-parameter tuning problem with a low-dimensionalcounterpart by learning the relationship between the hyper-parameters and thederivative-based global sensitivity indices. The performance of SGE-Kriging isfinally validated by means of numerical experiments with several benchmarks anda high-dimensional aerodynamic modeling problem. The results show that theSGE-Kriging model features an accuracy and robustness that is comparable to thestandard one but comes at much less training costs. The benefits are mostevident for high-dimensional problems with tens of variables.</description><author>Kai Cheng, Ralf Zimmermann</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 18:42:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03562v3</guid></item><item><title>Real-Time 2D Temperature Field Prediction in Metal Additive Manufacturing Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02403v1</link><description>Accurately predicting the temperature field in metal additive manufacturing(AM) processes is critical to preventing overheating, adjusting processparameters, and ensuring process stability. While physics-based computationalmodels offer precision, they are often time-consuming and unsuitable forreal-time predictions and online control in iterative design scenarios.Conversely, machine learning models rely heavily on high-quality datasets,which can be costly and challenging to obtain within the metal AM domain. Ourwork addresses this by introducing a physics-informed neural network frameworkspecifically designed for temperature field prediction in metal AM. Thisframework incorporates a physics-informed input, physics-informed lossfunction, and a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) architecture.Utilizing real-time temperature data from the process, our model predicts 2Dtemperature fields for future timestamps across diverse geometries, depositionpatterns, and process parameters. We validate the proposed framework in twoscenarios: full-field temperature prediction for a thin wall and 2D temperaturefield prediction for cylinder and cubic parts, demonstrating errors below 3%and 1%, respectively. Our proposed framework exhibits the flexibility to beapplied across diverse scenarios with varying process parameters, geometries,and deposition patterns.</description><author>Pouyan Sajadi, Mostafa Rahmani Dehaghani, Yifan Tang, G.

For unseen object categories, 2D open-vocabulary segmentationhas achieved promising results that solely rely on frozen CLIP backbones andensembling multiple classification outputs. However, we find that simplyextending these 2D models to 3D does not achieve good performance due to poorper-mask classification quality on novel categories. In this paper, we proposethe first method to tackle 3D open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Our modeltakes advantage of the fusion between learnable LiDAR features and dense frozenvision CLIP features, using a single classification head to make predictionsfor both base and novel classes. To further improve the classificationperformance on novel classes and leverage the CLIP model, we propose two novelloss functions: object-level distillation loss and voxel-level distillationloss.

Recentstudies have demonstrated that CNNs are biased toward styles (e.g.,uninformative textures) rather than content (e.g., shape), in stark contrast tothe human vision system. Radiologists tend to learn visual cues from CXRs andthus perform well across multiple domains. Motivated by this, we employ thenovel on-the-fly style randomization modules at both image (SRM-IL) and feature(SRM-FL) levels to create rich style perturbed features while keeping thecontent intact for robust cross-domain performance. Previous methods simulateunseen domains by constructing new styles via interpolation or swapping stylesfrom existing data, limiting them to available source domains during training.However, SRM-IL samples the style statistics from the possible value range of aCXR image instead of the training data to achieve more diversifiedaugmentations. Moreover, we utilize pixel-wise learnable parameters in theSRM-FL compared to pre-defined channel-wise mean and standard deviations asstyle embeddings for capturing more representative style features.Additionally, we leverage consistency regularizations on global semanticfeatures and predictive distributions from with and without style-perturbedversions of the same CXR to tweak the model's sensitivity toward contentmarkers for accurate predictions.

One crucial bottleneck of modeling animals is thelimited availability of training data, which we overcome by simply learningfrom 2D Internet images. We show that prior category-specific attempts fail togeneralize to rare species with limited training images. We address thischallenge by introducing the Semantic Bank of Skinned Models (SBSM), whichautomatically discovers a small set of base animal shapes by combininggeometric inductive priors with semantic knowledge implicitly captured by anoff-the-shelf self-supervised feature extractor.

However,data-driven neural operators all suffer from the same problem: the data neededto train a network depends on classical numerical solvers such as finitedifference or finite element, among others. In this paper, we propose a newapproach to generating synthetic functional training data that does not requiresolving a PDE numerically. The way we do this is simple: we draw a large number$N$ of independent and identically distributed `random functions' $u_j$ fromthe underlying solution space (e.g., $H_0^1(\Omega)$) in which we know thesolution lies according to classical theory. We then plug each such randomcandidate solution into the equation and get a corresponding right-hand sidefunction $f_j$ for the equation, and consider $(f_j, u_j)_{j=1}^N$ assupervised training data for learning the underlying inverse problem $f\rightarrow u$. This `backwards' approach to generating training data onlyrequires derivative computations, in contrast to standard `forward' approaches,which require a numerical PDE solver, enabling us to generate a large number ofsuch data points quickly and efficiently. While the idea is simple, we hopethat this method will expand the potential for developing neural PDE solversthat do not depend on classical numerical solvers.</description><author>Erisa Hasani, Rachel A.

To address thischallenge, we introduce Nuggets, a novel and efficient methodology that employsone shot learning to select high-quality instruction data from expansivedatasets. Nuggets assesses the potential of individual instruction examples toact as effective one shot examples, thereby identifying those that cansignificantly enhance diverse task performance. Nuggets utilizes a scoringsystem based on the impact of candidate examples on the perplexity of a diverseanchor set, facilitating the selection of the most beneficial data forinstruction tuning. Through rigorous testing on two benchmarks, includingMT-Bench and Alpaca-Eval, we demonstrate that instruction tuning with the top1% of Nuggets-curated examples substantially outperforms conventional methodsthat use the full dataset.

Current sparse-view 3D inference methodstypically rely on camera poses to geometrically aggregate information frominput views, but are not robust in-the-wild when such information isunavailable/inaccurate. In contrast, UpFusion sidesteps this requirement bylearning to implicitly leverage the available images as context in aconditional generative model for synthesizing novel views. We incorporate twocomplementary forms of conditioning into diffusion models for leveraging theinput views: a) via inferring query-view aligned features using a scene-leveltransformer, b) via intermediate attentional layers that can directly observethe input image tokens.

However, their unique combination of graphicalelements (e.g., bars, lines) and textual components (e.g., labels, legends)poses challenges for general-purpose multimodal models. While vision-languagemodels trained on chart data excel in comprehension, they struggle withgeneralization and require task-specific fine-tuning. To address thesechallenges, we propose ChartAssistant, a chart-based vision-language model foruniversal chart comprehension and reasoning. ChartAssistant leverages ChartSFT,a comprehensive dataset covering diverse chart-related tasks with basic andspecialized chart types. It undergoes a two-stage training process, startingwith pre-training on chart-to-table parsing to align chart and text, followedby multitask instruction-following fine-tuning. This approach enablesChartAssistant to achieve competitive performance across various chart taskswithout task-specific fine-tuning.

In this work, we present adata-driven methodology for modeling the dynamics of nonlinear systems. Tosimplify this task, we aim to identify a coordinate transformation that allowsus to represent the dynamics of nonlinear systems using a common, simple modelstructure. The advantage of a common simple model is that customized designtools developed for it can be applied to study a large variety of nonlinearsystems. The simplest common model -- one can think of -- is linear, but linearsystems often fall short in accurately capturing the complex dynamics ofnonlinear systems. In this work, we propose using quadratic systems as thecommon structure, inspired by the lifting principle. According to thisprinciple, smooth nonlinear systems can be expressed as quadratic systems insuitable coordinates without approximation errors. However, finding thesecoordinates solely from data is challenging. Here, we leverage deep learning toidentify such lifted coordinates using only data, enabling a quadraticdynamical system to describe the system's dynamics. Additionally, we discussthe asymptotic stability of these quadratic dynamical systems. We illustratethe approach using data collected from various numerical examples,demonstrating its superior performance with the existing well-known techniques.</description><author>Pawan Goyal, Peter Benner</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 17:51:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00357v2</guid></item><item><title>Vietnamese Poem Generation &amp; The Prospect Of Cross-Language Poem-To-Poem Translation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01078v3</link><description>Poetry generation has been a challenging task in the field of NaturalLanguage Processing, as it requires the model to understand the nuances oflanguage, sentiment, and style.

This task is time-consuming due to the sheer number of uniqueclinical concepts covered in the admission. Identifying and covering saliententities is vital for the summary to be clinically useful. We fine-tuneopen-source LLMs (Mistral-7B-Instruct and Zephyr-7B-\b{eta}) on the task andfind that they generate incomplete and unfaithful summaries. To increase entitycoverage, we train a smaller, encoder-only model to predict salient entities,which are treated as content-plans to guide the LLM. To encourage the LLM tofocus on specific mentions in the source notes, we propose SPEER:Sentence-level Planning via Embedded Entity Retrieval. Specifically, we markeach salient entity span with special "{{ }}" boundary tags and instruct theLLM to retrieve marked spans before generating each sentence. Sentence-levelplanning acts as a form of state tracking in that the model is explicitlyrecording the entities it uses.

However, computing such riskprobabilities in real-time and in unseen or changing environments ischallenging. Monte Carlo (MC) methods cannot accurately evaluate theprobabilities and their gradients as an infinitesimal devisor can amplify thesampling noise. In this paper, we develop an efficient method to evaluate theprobabilities of long-term risk and their gradients. The proposed methodexploits the fact that long-term risk probability satisfies certain partialdifferential equations (PDEs), which characterize the neighboring relationsbetween the probabilities, to integrate MC methods and physics-informed neuralnetworks. We provide theoretical guarantees of the estimation error givencertain choices of training configurations. Numerical results show the proposedmethod has better sample efficiency, generalizes well to unseen regions, andcan adapt to systems with changing parameters. The proposed method can alsoaccurately estimate the gradients of risk probabilities, which enables first-and second-order techniques on risk probabilities to be used for learning andcontrol.</description><author>Zhuoyuan Wang, Yorie Nakahira</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 17:19:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06432v2</guid></item><item><title>Integration of physics-informed operator learning and finite element method for parametric learning of partial differential equations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02363v1</link><description>We present a method that employs physics-informed deep learning techniquesfor parametrically solving partial differential equations.

However,the widely observed modality gap in the latent space of CLIP harms theperformance of zero-shot captioning by breaking the alignment between pairedimage-text features. To address this issue, we conduct an analysis on the CLIPlatent space which leads to two findings. Firstly, we observe that the CLIP'svisual feature of image subregions can achieve closer proximity to the pairedcaption due to the inherent information loss in text descriptions. In addition,we show that the modality gap between a paired image-text can be empiricallymodeled as a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. Motivated by the findings, wepropose a novel zero-shot image captioning framework with text-only training toreduce the modality gap. In particular, we introduce a subregion featureaggregation to leverage local region information, which produces a compactvisual representation for matching text representation. Moreover, weincorporate a noise injection and CLIP reranking strategy to boost captioningperformance. We also extend our framework to build a zero-shot VQA pipeline,demonstrating its generality.

Against this threat, a promising approach is to use MachineLearning (ML)-based side-channel analysis, which has the advantage of being anon-intrusive method, along with efficiently detecting HTs under goldenchip-free settings. In this paper, we question the trustworthiness of ML-basedHT detection via side-channel analysis. We introduce a HT obfuscation (HTO)approach to allow HTs to bypass this detection method. Rather thantheoretically misleading the model by simulated adversarial traces, a keyaspect of our approach is the design and implementation of adversarial noise aspart of the circuitry, alongside the HT. We detail HTO methodologies for ASICsand FPGAs, and evaluate our approach using TrustHub benchmark. Interestingly,we found that HTO can be implemented with only a single transistor for ASICdesigns to generate adversarial power traces that can fool the defense with100% efficiency. We also efficiently implemented our approach on a Spartan 6Xilinx FPGA using 2 different variants: (i) DSP slices-based, and (ii)ring-oscillator-based design. Additionally, we assess the efficiency ofcountermeasures like spectral domain analysis, and we show that an adaptiveattacker can still design evasive HTOs by constraining the design with aspectral noise budget. In addition, while adversarial training (AT) offershigher protection against evasive HTs, AT models suffer from a considerableutility loss, potentially rendering them unsuitable for such securityapplication.

As minority classes suffer from worse accuracy due tooverfitting on local imbalanced data, prior methods often incorporateclass-balanced learning techniques during local training. Despite the improvedmean accuracy across all classes, we observe that empty classes-referring tocategories absent from a client's data distribution-are still not wellrecognized. This paper introduces FedED, a novel approach in heterogeneousfederated learning that integrates both empty-class distillation and logitsuppression simultaneously. Specifically, empty-class distillation leveragesknowledge distillation during local training on each client to retain essentialinformation related to empty classes from the global model. Moreover, logitsuppression directly penalizes network logits for non-label classes,effectively addressing misclassifications in minority classes that may bebiased toward majority classes.

Segment Anything Model (SAM), built on the Vision Transformer(ViT) model with millions of parameters and vast training dataset SA-1B, excelsin various segmentation scenarios relying on its significance of semanticinformation and generalization ability. Such achievement of visual foundationmodel stimulates continuous researches on specific downstream tasks in computervision. The ClassWise-SAM-Adapter (CWSAM) is designed to adapt thehigh-performing SAM for landcover classification on space-borne SyntheticAperture Radar (SAR) images. The proposed CWSAM freezes most of SAM'sparameters and incorporates lightweight adapters for parameter efficientfine-tuning, and a classwise mask decoder is designed to achieve semanticsegmentation task. This adapt-tuning method allows for efficient landcoverclassification of SAR images, balancing the accuracy with computational demand.In addition, the task specific input module injects low frequency informationof SAR images by MLP-based layers to improve the model performance. Compared toconventional state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms by extensiveexperiments, CWSAM showcases enhanced performance with fewer computingresources, highlighting the potential of leveraging foundational models likeSAM for specific downstream tasks in the SAR domain.

The use of mmWave for various applications includingvehicular communications has been extensively discussed. However, applyingmmWave to vehicular communications faces challenges of high mobility nodes andnarrow coverage along the mmWave beams. Due to high mobility in dense networks,overlapping beams can cause strong interference which leads to performancedegradation. As a remedy, beam switching capability in mmWave can be utilized.Then, frequent beam switching and cell change become inevitable to manageinterference, which increase computational and signalling complexity. In orderto deal with the complexity in interference control, we develop a new strategycalled Multi-Agent Context Learning (MACOL), which utilizes Contextual Banditto manage interference while allocating mmWave beams to serve vehicles in thenetwork. Our approach demonstrates that by leveraging knowledge of neighbouringbeam status, the machine learning agent can identify and avoid potentialinterfering transmissions to other ongoing transmissions. Furthermore, we showthat even under heavy traffic loads, our proposed MACOL strategy is able tomaintain low interference levels at around 10%.</description><author>Abdulkadir Kose, Haeyoung Lee, Chuan Heng Foh, Mohammad Shojafar</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 15:43:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02323v1</guid></item><item><title>BA-SAM: Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask for Segment Anything Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02317v1</link><description>In this paper, we address the challenge of image resolution variation for theSegment Anything Model (SAM). SAM, known for its zero-shot generalizability,exhibits a performance degradation when faced with datasets with varying imagesizes. Previous approaches tend to resize the image to a fixed size or adoptstructure modifications, hindering the preservation of SAM's rich priorknowledge. Besides, such task-specific tuning necessitates a completeretraining of the model, which is cost-expensive and unacceptable fordeployment in the downstream tasks. In this paper, we reformulate this issue asa length extrapolation problem, where token sequence length varies whilemaintaining a consistent patch size for images of different sizes. To this end,we propose Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask (BA-SAM) to enhance SAM'sadaptability to varying image resolutions while eliminating the need forstructure modifications. Firstly, we introduce a new scaling factor to ensureconsistent magnitude in the attention layer's dot product values when the tokensequence length changes. Secondly, we present a bias-mode attention mask thatallows each token to prioritize neighboring information, mitigating the impactof untrained distant information. Our BA-SAM demonstrates efficacy in twoscenarios: zero-shot and fine-tuning. Extensive evaluation on diverse datasets,including DIS5K, DUTS, ISIC, COD10K, and COCO, reveals its ability tosignificantly mitigate performance degradation in the zero-shot setting andachieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal fine-tuning. Furthermore, wepropose a generalized model and benchmark, showcasing BA-SAM's generalizabilityacross all four datasets simultaneously.</description><author>Yiran Song, Qianyu Zhou, Xiangtai Li, Deng-Ping Fan, Xuequan Lu, Lizhuang Ma</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 15:34:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02317v1</guid></item><item><title>SuperEdge: Towards a Generalization Model for Self-Supervised Edge Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02313v1</link><description>Edge detection is a fundamental technique in various computer vision tasks.Edges are indeed effectively delineated by pixel discontinuity and can offerreliable structural information even in textureless areas.

Mostrecent approaches rely on deep neural networks, which, despite their impressiveperformance, possess opacity, making it challenging to elucidate their outputfor a given input. While the issue of interpretability has been emphasized inother fields like medicine, it has not received attention in music-relatedtasks. In this study, we explored the relevance of interpretability in thecontext of automatic music tagging. We constructed a workflow that incorporatesthree different information extraction techniques: a) leveraging symbolicknowledge, b) utilizing auxiliary deep neural networks, and c) employing signalprocessing to extract perceptual features from audio files. These features weresubsequently used to train an interpretable machine-learning model for tagprediction. We conducted experiments on two datasets, namely the MTG-Jamendodataset and the GTZAN dataset. Our method surpassed the performance of baselinemodels in both tasks and, in certain instances, demonstrated competitivenesswith the current state-of-the-art.

This paper focuses on two model compression techniques: low-rankapproximation and weight pruning in neural networks, which are very popularnowadays. However, training NN with low-rank approximation and weight pruningalways suffers significant accuracy loss and convergence issues. In this paper,a holistic framework is proposed for model compression from a novel perspectiveof nonconvex optimization by designing an appropriate objective function. Then,we introduce NN-BCD, a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to solve thenonconvex optimization. One advantage of our algorithm is that an efficientiteration scheme can be derived with closed-form, which is gradient-free.Therefore, our algorithm will not suffer from vanishing/exploding gradientproblems. Furthermore, with the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (K{\L}) property of ourobjective function, we show that our algorithm globally converges to a criticalpoint at the rate of O(1/k), where k denotes the number of iterations. Lastly,extensive experiments with tensor train decomposition and weight pruningdemonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of the proposed framework.Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ChenyangLi-97/NN-BCD</description><author>Chenyang Li, Jihoon Chung, Biao Cai, Haimin Wang, Xianlian Zhou, Bo Shen</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 15:06:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06815v2</guid></item><item><title>Learning to Generate Training Datasets for Robust Semantic Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02535v3</link><description>Semantic segmentation methods have advanced significantly.

This taskis particularly challenging for real-world acquisitions due to factors likenoise, outliers, non-uniform sampling, and missing data. Traditional approachesoften simplify the problem by imposing handcrafted priors on either the inputpoint clouds or the resulting surface, a process that can necessitate tedioushyperparameter tuning. Conversely, deep learning models have the capability todirectly learn the properties of input point clouds and desired surfaces fromdata. We study the influence of these handcrafted and learned priors on theprecision and robustness of surface reconstruction techniques. We evaluatevarious time-tested and contemporary methods in a standardized manner. Whenboth trained and evaluated on point clouds with identical characteristics, thelearning-based models consistently produce superior surfaces compared to theirtraditional counterparts$\unicode{x2013}$even in scenarios involving novelshape categories. However, traditional methods demonstrate greater resilienceto the diverse array of point cloud anomalies commonly found in real-world 3Dacquisitions.

Recently,several methods have been devoted to building DETR-based networks to solve bothMR and HD jointly. These methods simply add two separate task heads aftermulti-modal feature extraction and feature interaction, achieving goodperformance. Nevertheless, these approaches underutilize the reciprocalrelationship between two tasks. In this paper, we propose a task-reciprocaltransformer based on DETR (TR-DETR) that focuses on exploring the inherentreciprocity between MR and HD. Specifically, a local-global multi-modalalignment module is first built to align features from diverse modalities intoa shared latent space. Subsequently, a visual feature refinement is designed toeliminate query-irrelevant information from visual features for modalinteraction. Finally, a task cooperation module is constructed to refine theretrieval pipeline and the highlight score prediction process by utilizing thereciprocity between MR and HD. Comprehensive experiments on QVHighlights,Charades-STA and TVSum datasets demonstrate that TR-DETR outperforms existingstate-of-the-art methods.

Accordingly, a number of works aredevoted to the efficient approximation of the Shapley value, most of themrevolve around the notion of an agent's marginal contribution.

Thenetwork is trained on a data set that consists of randomly selected points inthe physical domain and its boundary. PINNs have been successfully applied tosolve various problems described by PDEs with boundary conditions. The lossfunction in traditional PINNs is based on the strong residuals of the PDEs.This loss function in PINNs is generally not robust with respect to the trueerror. The loss function in PINNs can be far from the true error, which makesthe training process more difficult. In particular, we do not know if thetraining process has already converged to the solution with the requiredaccuracy. This is especially true if we do not know the exact solution, so wecannot estimate the true error during the training. This paper introduces adifferent way of defining the loss function. It incorporates the residual andthe inverse of the Gram matrix, computed using the energy norm. We test ourRPINN algorithm on two Laplace problems and one advection-diffusion problem intwo spatial dimensions. We conclude that RPINN is a robust method. The proposedloss coincides well with the true error of the solution, as measured in theenergy norm.

To reconstruct continuous surfaces from discrete point clouds,encoding the input points into regular grid features (plane or volume) has beencommonly employed in existing approaches. However, these methods typically usethe grid as an index for uniformly scattering point features. Compared with theirregular point features, the regular grid features may sacrifice somereconstruction details but improve efficiency. To take full advantage of thesetwo types of features, we introduce a novel and high-efficiency attentionmechanism between the grid and point features named Point-Grid Transformer(GridFormer). This mechanism treats the grid as a transfer point connecting thespace and point cloud. Our method maximizes the spatial expressiveness of gridfeatures and maintains computational efficiency. Furthermore, optimizingpredictions over the entire space could potentially result in blurredboundaries. To address this issue, we further propose a boundary optimizationstrategy incorporating margin binary cross-entropy loss and boundary sampling.This approach enables us to achieve a more precise representation of the objectstructure.

We design a novel simplified graph-poweringtechnique, which enables the generation of path-based explanations with a fullyparallelisable and memory-efficient training scheme. We further introduce threenew metrics for quantitative evaluation of the explanations, together with aqualitative human evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Power-Linkoutperforms the SOTA baselines in interpretability, efficiency, andscalability.</description><author>Heng Chang, Jiangnan Ye, Alejo Lopez Avila, Jinhua Du, Jia Li</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 14:19:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02290v1</guid></item><item><title>SGFormer: Simplifying and Empowering Transformers for Large-Graph Representations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10759v4</link><description>Learning representations on large-sized graphs is a long-standing challengedue to the inter-dependence nature involved in massive data points.Transformers, as an emerging class of foundation encoders for graph-structureddata, have shown promising performance on small graphs due to its globalattention capable of capturing all-pair influence beyond neighboring nodes.Even so, existing approaches tend to inherit the spirit of Transformers inlanguage and vision tasks, and embrace complicated models by stacking deepmulti-head attentions. In this paper, we critically demonstrate that even usinga one-layer attention can bring up surprisingly competitive performance acrossnode property prediction benchmarks where node numbers range fromthousand-level to billion-level. This encourages us to rethink the designphilosophy for Transformers on large graphs, where the global attention is acomputation overhead hindering the scalability. We frame the proposed scheme asSimplified Graph Transformers (SGFormer), which is empowered by a simpleattention model that can efficiently propagate information among arbitrarynodes in one layer. SGFormer requires none of positional encodings,feature/graph pre-processing or augmented loss. Empirically, SGFormersuccessfully scales to the web-scale graph ogbn-papers100M and yields up to141x inference acceleration over SOTA Transformers on medium-sized graphs.Beyond current results, we believe the proposed methodology alone enlightens anew technical path of independent interest for building Transformers on largegraphs.</description><author>Qitian Wu, Wentao Zhao, Chenxiao Yang, Hengrui Zhang, Fan Nie, Haitian Jiang, Yatao Bian, Junchi Yan</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 14:19:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10759v4</guid></item><item><title>Learning Discretized Neural Networks under Ricci Flow</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03390v4</link><description>In this paper, we study Discretized Neural Networks (DNNs) composed oflow-precision weights and activations, which suffer from either infinite orzero gradients due to the non-differentiable discrete function during training.Most training-based DNNs in such scenarios employ the standard Straight-ThroughEstimator (STE) to approximate the gradient w.r.t. discrete values. However,the use of STE introduces the problem of gradient mismatch, arising fromperturbations in the approximated gradient. To address this problem, this paperreveals that this mismatch can be interpreted as a metric perturbation in aRiemannian manifold, viewed through the lens of duality theory. Building oninformation geometry, we construct the Linearly Nearly Euclidean (LNE) manifoldfor DNNs, providing a background for addressing perturbations. By introducing apartial differential equation on metrics, i.e., the Ricci flow, we establishthe dynamical stability and convergence of the LNE metric with the $L^2$-normperturbation. In contrast to previous perturbation theories with convergencerates in fractional powers, the metric perturbation under the Ricci flowexhibits exponential decay in the LNE manifold. Experimental results acrossvarious datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior and more stableperformance for DNNs compared to other representative training-based methods.</description><author>Jun Chen, Hanwen Chen, Mengmeng Wang, Guang Dai, Ivor W.

Smooth interpretation (SI) is a form of abstract interpretation thatapproximates the convolution of a program's output with a Gaussian kernel, thussmoothing its output in a principled manner. Here, we combine SI with automaticdifferentiation (AD) to efficiently compute gradients of smoothed programs. Incontrast to AD across a regular program execution, these gradients also capturethe effects of alternative control flow paths. The combination of SI with ADenables the direct gradient-based parameter synthesis for branching programs,allowing for instance the calibration of simulation models or their combinationwith neural network models in machine learning pipelines. We detail the effectsof the approximations made for tractability in SI and propose a novel MonteCarlo estimator that avoids the underlying assumptions by estimating thesmoothed programs' gradients through a combination of AD and sampling. UsingDiscoGrad, our tool for automatically translating simple C++ programs to asmooth differentiable form, we perform an extensive evaluation. We compare thecombination of SI with AD and our Monte Carlo estimator to existinggradient-free and stochastic methods on four non-trivial and originallydiscontinuous problems ranging from classical simulation-based optimization toneural network-driven control. While the optimization progress with theSI-based estimator depends on the complexity of the program's control flow, ourMonte Carlo estimator is competitive in all problems, exhibiting the fastestconvergence by a substantial margin in our highest-dimensional problem.</description><author>Justin N.

Patterned textures inspection, particularly inthe context of fabric defect detection, is indeed a widely encountered usecase. This task involves handling a diverse spectrum of colors and textiletypes, encompassing a wide range of fabrics. Given the extensive variability incolors, textures, and defect types, fabric defect detection poses a complex andchallenging problem in the field of patterned textures inspection. In thisarticle, we propose a knowledge distillation-based approach tailoredspecifically for addressing the challenge of unsupervised anomaly detection intextures resembling fabrics. Our method aims to redefine the recentlyintroduced reverse distillation approach, which advocates for anencoder-decoder design to mitigate classifier bias and to prevent the studentfrom reconstructing anomalies. In this study, we present a new reversedistillation technique for the specific task of fabric defect detection. Ourapproach involves a meticulous design selection that strategically highlightshigh-level features. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach both interms of performance and inference speed, we conducted a series of experimentson multiple texture datasets, including MVTEC AD, AITEX, and TILDA, alongsideconducting experiments on a dataset acquired from a textile manufacturingfacility. The main contributions of this paper are the following: a robusttexture anomaly detector utilizing a reverse knowledge-distillation techniquesuitable for both anomaly detection and domain generalization and a noveldataset encompassing a diverse range of fabrics and defects.</description><author>Simon Thomine, Hichem Snoussi</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 14:10:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02287v1</guid></item><item><title>DEM: A Method for Certifying Deep Neural Network Classifier Outputs in Aerospace</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02283v1</link><description>Software development in the aerospace domain requires adhering to strict,high-quality standards. While there exist regulatory guidelines for commercialsoftware in this domain (e.g., ARP-4754 and DO-178), these do not apply tosoftware with deep neural network (DNN) components. Consequently, it is unclearhow to allow aerospace systems to benefit from the deep learning revolution.Our work here seeks to address this challenge with a novel, output-centricapproach for DNN certification. Our method employs statistical verificationtechniques, and has the key advantage of being able to flag specific inputs forwhich the DNN's output may be unreliable - so that they may be later inspectedby a human expert. To achieve this, our method conducts a statistical analysisof the DNN's predictions for other, nearby inputs, in order to detectinconsistencies. This is in contrast to existing techniques, which typicallyattempt to certify the entire DNN, as opposed to individual outputs. Our methoduses the DNN as a black-box, and makes no assumptions about its topology. Wehope that this work constitutes another step towards integrating DNNs insafety-critical applications - especially in the aerospace domain, where highstandards of quality and reliability are crucial.</description><author>Guy Katz, Natan Levy, Idan Refaeli, Raz Yerushalmi</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 14:01:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02283v1</guid></item><item><title>Dynamically Masked Discriminator for Generative Adversarial Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07716v3</link><description>Training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) remains a challengingproblem. The discriminator trains the generator by learning the distribution ofreal/generated data. However, the distribution of generated data changesthroughout the training process, which is difficult for the discriminator tolearn. In this paper, we propose a novel method for GANs from the viewpoint ofonline continual learning. We observe that the discriminator model, trained onhistorically generated data, often slows down its adaptation to the changes inthe new arrival generated data, which accordingly decreases the quality ofgenerated results. By treating the generated data in training as a stream, wepropose to detect whether the discriminator slows down the learning of newknowledge in generated data. Therefore, we can explicitly enforce thediscriminator to learn new knowledge fast. Particularly, we propose a newdiscriminator, which automatically detects its retardation and then dynamicallymasks its features, such that the discriminator can adaptively learn thetemporally-vary distribution of generated data.

In particular, overfishing isone the main issues in sustainable marine development. In alignment with theprotection of marine resources and sustainable fishing, this study proposes toadvance fish classification techniques that support identifying protected fishspecies using state-of-the-art machine learning. We use a custom modificationof the MobileNet model to design a lightweight classifier called M-MobileNetthat is capable of running on limited hardware. As part of the study, wecompiled a labeled dataset of 37,462 images of fish found in the waters of theIndonesian archipelago. The proposed model is trained on the dataset toclassify images of the captured fish into their species and giverecommendations on whether they are consumable or not. Our modified MobileNetmodel uses only 50\% of the top layer parameters with about 42% GTX 860Mutility and achieves up to 97% accuracy in fish classification and determiningits consumability. Given the limited computing capacity available on manyfishing vessels, the proposed model provides a practical solution to on-sitefish classification. In addition, synchronized implementation of the proposedmodel on multiple vessels can supply valuable information about the movementand location of different species of fish.</description><author>Febrian Kurniawan, Gandeva Bayu Satrya, Firuz Kamalov</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 13:56:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02278v1</guid></item><item><title>Universal Approximation Theorem for Vector- and Hypercomplex-Valued Neural Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02277v1</link><description>The universal approximation theorem states that a neural network with onehidden layer can approximate continuous functions on compact sets with anydesired precision.

This leads to a need for event data augmentation techniquesin order to improve accuracy as well as to avoid over-fitting on the trainingdata.

Some paradigms have been recently developed to explore this adversarialphenomenon occurring at different stages of a machine learning system, such asbackdoor attack occurring at the pre-training, in-training and inference stage;weight attack occurring at the post-training, deployment and inference stage;adversarial attack occurring at the inference stage. However, although theseadversarial paradigms share a common goal, their developments are almostindependent, and there is still no big picture of AML. In this work, we aim toprovide a unified perspective to the AML community to systematically review theoverall progress of this field. We firstly provide a general definition aboutAML, and then propose a unified mathematical framework to covering existingattack paradigms. According to the proposed unified framework, we build a fulltaxonomy to systematically categorize and review existing representativemethods for each paradigm. Besides, using this unified framework, it is easy tofigure out the connections and differences among different attack paradigms,which may inspire future researchers to develop more advanced attack paradigms.Finally, to facilitate the viewing of the built taxonomy and the relatedliterature in adversarial machine learning, we further provide a website, \ie,\url{http://adversarial-ml.com}, where the taxonomies and literature will becontinuously updated.</description><author>Baoyuan Wu, Zihao Zhu, Li Liu, Qingshan Liu, Zhaofeng He, Siwei Lyu</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 13:43:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09457v2</guid></item><item><title>How do media talk about the Covid-19 pandemic?

These models with robust and alignedsemantic representations learned from billions of internet image-text pairs andcan be applied to various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. However, insome fine-grained domains like medical imaging and remote sensing, theperformance of multi-modal foundation models often leaves much to be desired.Consequently, many researchers have begun to explore few-shot adaptationmethods for these models, gradually deriving three main technical approaches:1) prompt-based methods, 2) adapter-based methods, and 3) externalknowledge-based methods. Nevertheless, this rapidly developing field hasproduced numerous results without a comprehensive survey to systematicallyorganize the research progress. Therefore, in this survey, we introduce andanalyze the research advancements in few-shot adaptation methods formulti-modal models, summarizing commonly used datasets and experimental setups,and comparing the results of different methods. In addition, due to the lack ofreliable theoretical support for existing methods, we derive the few-shotadaptation generalization error bound for multi-modal models.

One of the major challenges is credit assignment, which aims to creditagents by their contributions. While prior studies have shown great success,their methods typically fail to work in episodic reinforcement learningscenarios where global rewards are revealed only at the end of the episode.They lack the functionality to model complicated relations of the delayedglobal reward in the temporal dimension and suffer from inefficiencies. Totackle this, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Attention with Shapley (STAS), anovel method that learns credit assignment in both temporal and spatialdimensions. It first decomposes the global return back to each time step, thenutilizes the Shapley Value to redistribute the individual payoff from thedecomposed global reward. To mitigate the computational complexity of theShapley Value, we introduce an approximation of marginal contribution andutilize Monte Carlo sampling to estimate it.

Moreover, sVORF significantly reduces memoryrequirement due to small-sized pixel rendering during training. We demonstratethe effectiveness of our approach by showing top results in scene decompositionand generation tasks of complex synthetic datasets (e.g., Room-Diverse).Furthermore, we also confirm the potential of sVORF to segment objects inreal-world scenes (e.g., the LLFF dataset). We hope our approach can providepreliminary understanding of the physical world and help ease future researchin 3D object-centric representation learning.</description><author>Di Qi, Tong Yang, Xiangyu Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 12:52:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02241v1</guid></item><item><title>U-Mixer: An Unet-Mixer Architecture with Stationarity Correction for Time Series Forecasting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02236v1</link><description>Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains. Caused byfactors such as trends, seasonality, or irregular fluctuations, time seriesoften exhibits non-stationary. It obstructs stable feature propagation throughdeep layers, disrupts feature distributions, and complicates learning datadistribution changes. As a result, many existing models struggle to capture theunderlying patterns, leading to degraded forecasting performance. In thisstudy, we tackle the challenge of non-stationarity in time series forecastingwith our proposed framework called U-Mixer. By combining Unet and Mixer,U-Mixer effectively captures local temporal dependencies between differentpatches and channels separately to avoid the influence of distributionvariations among channels, and merge low- and high-levels features to obtaincomprehensive data representations. The key contribution is a novelstationarity correction method, explicitly restoring data distribution byconstraining the difference in stationarity between the data before and aftermodel processing to restore the non-stationarity information, while ensuringthe temporal dependencies are preserved. Through extensive experiments onvarious real-world time series datasets, U-Mixer demonstrates its effectivenessand robustness, and achieves 14.5\% and 7.7\% improvements overstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</description><author>Xiang Ma, Xuemei Li, Lexin Fang, Tianlong Zhao, Caiming Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 12:41:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02236v1</guid></item><item><title>Trajectory-Oriented Policy Optimization with Sparse Rewards</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02225v1</link><description>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) remains challenging in tasks with sparserewards. These sparse rewards often only indicate whether the task is partiallyor fully completed, meaning that many exploration actions must be performedbefore the agent obtains useful feedback. Hence, most existing DRL algorithmsfail to learn feasible policies within a reasonable time frame. To overcomethis problem, we develop an approach that exploits offline demonstrationtrajectories for faster and more efficient online RL in sparse reward settings.Our key insight is that by regarding offline demonstration trajectories asguidance, instead of imitating them, our method learns a policy whosestate-action visitation marginal distribution matches that of offlinedemonstrations. Specifically, we introduce a novel trajectory distance based onmaximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and formulate policy optimization as adistance-constrained optimization problem. Then, we show that thisdistance-constrained optimization problem can be reduced into a policy-gradientalgorithm with shaped rewards learned from offline demonstrations. The proposedalgorithm is evaluated on extensive discrete and continuous control tasks withsparse and deceptive rewards. The experimental results indicate that ourproposed algorithm is significantly better than the baseline methods regardingdiverse exploration and learning the optimal policy.</description><author>Guojian Wang, Faguo Wu, Xiao Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 12:21:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02225v1</guid></item><item><title>Expressive Speech-driven Facial Animation with controllable emotions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02008v2</link><description>It is in high demand to generate facial animation with high realism, but itremains a challenging task.

The global model is then sharedamong all the participants which use it for local predictions. In this paper,we put forward a novel attacker model aiming at turning FL systems into covertchannels to implement a stealth communication infrastructure.

However, DPalgorithm design is often presented in an ad-hoc manner. It is sometimesdifficult to justify algorithm correctness. To address this issue, this paperpresents a rigorous algebraic formalism for systematically deriving DPalgorithms, based on semiring polymorphism. We start with a specification,construct an algorithm to compute the required solution which is self-evidentlycorrect because it exhaustively generates and evaluates all possible solutionsmeeting the specification. We then derive, through the use of shortcut fusion,an implementation of this algorithm which is both efficient and correct. Wealso demonstrate how, with the use of semiring lifting, the specification canbe augmented with combinatorial constraints, showing how these constraints canbe fused with the algorithm. We furthermore demonstrate how existing DPalgorithms for a given combinatorial problem can be abstracted from theiroriginal context and re-purposed. This approach can be applied to the full scope of combinatorial problemsexpressible in terms of semirings. This includes, for example: optimalprobability and Viterbi decoding, probabilistic marginalization, logicalinference, fuzzy sets, differentiable softmax, relational and provenancequeries. The approach, building on ideas from the existing literature onconstructive algorithmics, exploits generic properties of polymorphicfunctions, tupling and formal sums and algebraic simplifications arising fromconstraint algebras. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this formalism forsome example applications arising in signal processing, bioinformatics andreliability engineering.

The detection task unifies allpersons while the re-id task discriminates different identities, resulting inconflict optimal objectives. Existing works proposed to decouple end-to-endperson search to alleviate such conflict. Yet these methods are stillsub-optimal on one or two of the sub-tasks due to their partially decoupledmodels, which limits the overall person search performance. In this paper, wepropose to fully decouple person search towards optimal person search. Atask-incremental person search network is proposed to incrementally constructan end-to-end model for the detection and re-id sub-task, which decouples themodel architecture for the two sub-tasks.

When $t$fa is applied tomatrix data, it is common to first vectorize the matrix observations. Thisintroduces two challenges for $t$fa: (i) the inherent matrix structure of thedata is broken, and (ii) robustness may be lost, as vectorized matrix datatypically results in a high data dimension, which could easily lead to thebreakdown of $t$fa. To address these issues, starting from the intrinsic matrixstructure of matrix data, a novel robust factor analysis model, namely bilinearfactor analysis built on the matrix-variate $t$ distribution ($t$bfa), isproposed in this paper. The novelty is that it is capable to simultaneouslyextract common factors for both row and column variables of interest onheavy-tailed or contaminated matrix data. Two efficient algorithms for maximumlikelihood estimation of $t$bfa are developed. Closed-form expression for theFisher information matrix to calculate the accuracy of parameter estimates arederived. Empirical studies are conducted to understand the proposed $t$bfamodel and compare with related competitors. The results demonstrate thesuperiority and practicality of $t$bfa. Importantly, $t$bfa exhibits asignificantly higher breakdown point than $t$fa, making it more suitable formatrix data.</description><author>Xuan Ma, Jianhua Zhao, Changchun Shang, Fen Jiang, Philip L.

A key challenge of lip-to-speechsystems is the one-to-many mapping caused by (1) the existence of homophenesand (2) multiple speech variations, resulting in a mispronounced andover-smoothed speech. In this paper, we propose a novel lip-to-speech systemthat significantly improves the generation quality by alleviating theone-to-many mapping problem from multiple perspectives. Specifically, weincorporate (1) self-supervised speech representations to disambiguatehomophenes, and (2) acoustic variance information to model diverse speechstyles.

We perform extensive experiments on two datasets, and demonstrate thatour method achieves the generation quality close to that of real humanutterance, outperforming existing methods in terms of speech naturalness andintelligibility by a large margin.

Inthis work, we propose Solo Performance Prompting (SPP), which transforms asingle LLM into a cognitive synergist by engaging in multi-turnself-collaboration with multiple personas. A cognitive synergist is anintelligent agent that collaboratively combines multiple minds' strengths andknowledge to enhance problem-solving in complex tasks. By dynamicallyidentifying and simulating different personas based on task inputs, SPPunleashes the potential of cognitive synergy in LLMs. Our in-depth analysisshows that assigning multiple fine-grained personas in LLMs improvesproblem-solving abilities compared to using a single or fixed number ofpersonas. We evaluate SPP on three challenging tasks: Trivia Creative Writing,Codenames Collaborative, and Logic Grid Puzzle, encompassing bothknowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive types. Unlike previous works, suchas Chain-of-Thought, that solely enhance the reasoning abilities in LLMs,experimental results demonstrate that SPP effectively reduces factualhallucination, and maintains strong reasoning capabilities. Additionally,comparative experiments show that cognitive synergy only emerges in GPT-4 anddoes not appear in less capable models, such as GPT-3.5-turbo andLlama2-13b-chat, which draws an interesting analogy to human development.

However, these models are susceptible to replicating or evenamplifying bias present in real-world data. While there are various biasmitigation methods and base estimators in the literature, selecting the optimalmodel for a specific application remains challenging. This paper focuses on binary classification and proposes FairGridSearch, anovel framework for comparing fairness-enhancing models. FairGridSearch enablesexperimentation with different model parameter combinations and recommends thebest one. The study applies FairGridSearch to three popular datasets (Adult,COMPAS, and German Credit) and analyzes the impacts of metric selection, baseestimator choice, and classification threshold on model fairness. The results highlight the significance of selecting appropriate accuracy andfairness metrics for model evaluation. Additionally, different base estimatorsand classification threshold values affect the effectiveness of bias mitigationmethods and fairness stability respectively, but the effects are not consistentacross all datasets. Based on these findings, future research on fairness inmachine learning should consider a broader range of factors when building fairmodels, going beyond bias mitigation methods alone.</description><author>Shih-Chi Ma, Tatiana Ermakova, Benjamin Fabian</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 10:29:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02183v1</guid></item></channel></rss>

A Survey on Quality of Datasets With Machine-Generated Texts</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14677v1</link><description>The rapid development of autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) hassignificantly improved the quality of generated texts, necessitating reliablemachine-generated text detectors. A huge number of detectors and collectionswith AI fragments have emerged, and several detection methods even showedrecognition quality up to 99.9% according to the target metrics in suchcollections. However, the quality of such detectors tends to drop dramaticallyin the wild, posing a question: Are detectors actually highly trustworthy or dotheir high benchmark scores come from the poor quality of evaluation datasets?In this paper, we emphasise the need for robust and qualitative methods forevaluating generated data to be secure against bias and low generalisingability of future model. We present a systematic review of datasets fromcompetitions dedicated to AI-generated content detection and propose methodsfor evaluating the quality of datasets containing AI-generated fragments. Inaddition, we discuss the possibility of using high-quality generated data toachieve two goals: improving the training of detection models and improving thetraining datasets themselves. Our contribution aims to facilitate a betterunderstanding of the dynamics between human and machine text, which willultimately support the integrity of information in an increasingly automatedworld.</description><author>German Gritsai, Anastasia Voznyuk, Andrey Grabovoy, Yury Chekhovich</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:59:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14677v1</guid></item><item><title>SudoLM: Learning Access Control of Parametric Knowledge with Authorization Alignment</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14676v1</link><description>Existing preference alignment is a one-size-fits-all alignment mechanism,where the part of the large language model (LLM) parametric knowledge withnon-preferred features is uniformly blocked to all the users. However, thispart of knowledge can be useful to advanced users whose expertise qualifiesthem to handle these information. The one-size-fits-all alignment mechanismundermines LLM's utility for these qualified users. To address this problem, wepropose SudoLM, a framework that lets LLMs learn access control over specificparametric knowledge for users with different credentials via authorizationalignment. SudoLM allows authorized users to unlock their access to all theparametric knowledge with an assigned SUDO key while blocking access tonon-qualified users. Experiments on two application scenarios demonstrate thatSudoLM effectively controls the user's access to the parametric knowledge andmaintains its general utility.</description><author>Qin Liu, Fei Wang, Chaowei Xiao, Muhao Chen</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:59:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14676v1</guid></item><item><title>Enhancing Large Language Models' Situated Faithfulness to External Contexts</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14675v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) are often augmented with external information ascontexts, but this external information can sometimes be inaccurate or evenintentionally misleading. We argue that robust LLMs should demonstrate situatedfaithfulness, dynamically calibrating their trust in external information basedon their confidence in the internal knowledge and the external context. Tobenchmark this capability, we evaluate LLMs across several QA datasets,including a newly created dataset called RedditQA featuring in-the-wildincorrect contexts sourced from Reddit posts. We show that when provided withboth correct and incorrect contexts, both open-source and proprietary modelstend to overly rely on external information, regardless of its factualaccuracy. To enhance situated faithfulness, we propose two approaches:Self-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence Reasoning(RCR). SCR enables models to self-access the confidence of external informationrelative to their own internal knowledge to produce the most accurate answer.RCR, in contrast, extracts explicit confidence signals from the LLM anddetermines the final answer using predefined rules. Our results show that forLLMs with strong reasoning capabilities, such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, SCRoutperforms RCR, achieving improvements of up to 24.2% over a direct inputaugmentation baseline. Conversely, for a smaller model like Llama-3-8B, RCRoutperforms SCR. Fine-tuning SCR with our proposed Confidence Reasoning DirectPreference Optimization (CR-DPO) method improves performance on both seen andunseen datasets, yielding an average improvement of 8.9% on Llama-3-8B. Inaddition to quantitative results, we offer insights into the relative strengthsof SCR and RCR. Our findings highlight promising avenues for improving situatedfaithfulness in LLMs. The data and code are released.</description><author>Yukun Huang, Sanxing Chen, Hongyi Cai, Bhuwan Dhingra</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:59:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14675v1</guid></item><item><title>Self-supervised contrastive learning performs non-linear system identification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14673v1</link><description>Self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have brought tremendous successacross many tasks and domains. It has been argued that these successes can beattributed to a link between SSL and identifiable representation learning:Temporal structure and auxiliary variables ensure that latent representationsare related to the true underlying generative factors of the data. Here, wedeepen this connection and show that SSL can perform system identification inlatent space. We propose DynCL, a framework to uncover linear, switching linearand non-linear dynamics under a non-linear observation model, give theoreticalguarantees and validate them empirically.</description><author>Rodrigo Gonz√°lez Laiz, Tobias Schmidt, Steffen Schneider</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:59:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14673v1</guid></item><item><title>BiGR: Harnessing Binary Latent Codes for Image Generation and Improved Visual Representation Capabilities</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14672v1</link><description>We introduce BiGR, a novel conditional image generation model using compactbinary latent codes for generative training, focusing on enhancing bothgeneration and representation capabilities. BiGR is the first conditionalgenerative model that unifies generation and discrimination within the sameframework.

Moreover, BiGR showcases zero-shot generalizationacross various vision tasks, enabling applications such as image inpainting,outpainting, editing, interpolation, and enrichment, without the need forstructural modifications. Our findings suggest that BiGR unifies generative anddiscriminative tasks effectively, paving the way for further advancements inthe field.</description><author>Shaozhe Hao, Xuantong Liu, Xianbiao Qi, Shihao Zhao, Bojia Zi, Rong Xiao, Kai Han, Kwan-Yee K.

However, current SAEsfall short of completely explaining model performance, resulting in "darkmatter": unexplained variance in activations. This work investigates darkmatter as an object of study in its own right. Surprisingly, we find that muchof SAE dark matter--about half of the error vector itself and &gt;90% of itsnorm--can be linearly predicted from the initial activation vector.Additionally, we find that the scaling behavior of SAE error norms at a pertoken level is remarkably predictable: larger SAEs mostly struggle toreconstruct the same contexts as smaller SAEs. We build on the linearrepresentation hypothesis to propose models of activations that might lead tothese observations, including postulating a new type of "introduced error";these insights imply that the part of the SAE error vector that cannot belinearly predicted ("nonlinear" error) might be fundamentally different fromthe linearly predictable component. To validate this hypothesis, we empiricallyanalyze nonlinear SAE error and show that 1) it contains fewer not yet learnedfeatures, 2) SAEs trained on it are quantitatively worse, 3) it helps predictSAE per-token scaling behavior, and 4) it is responsible for a proportionalamount of the downstream increase in cross entropy loss when SAE activationsare inserted into the model. Finally, we examine two methods to reducenonlinear SAE error at a fixed sparsity: inference time gradient pursuit, whichleads to a very slight decrease in nonlinear error, and linear transformationsfrom earlier layer SAE outputs, which leads to a larger reduction.</description><author>Joshua Engels, Logan Riggs, Max Tegmark</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:58:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14670v1</guid></item><item><title>NaturalBench: Evaluating Vision-Language Models on Natural Adversarial Samples</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14669v1</link><description>Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recentvisual-question-answering (VQA) benchmarks that evaluate complexvisio-linguistic reasoning. However, are these models truly effective? In thiswork, we show that VLMs still struggle with natural images and questions thathumans can easily answer, which we term natural adversarial samples. We alsofind it surprisingly easy to generate these VQA samples from natural image-textcorpora using off-the-shelf models like CLIP and ChatGPT. We propose asemi-automated approach to collect a new benchmark, NaturalBench, for reliablyevaluating VLMs with 10,000 human-verified VQA samples. Crucially, we adopt a$\textbf{vision-centric}$ design by pairing each question with two images thatyield different answers, preventing blind solutions from answering withoutusing the images. This makes NaturalBench more challenging than previousbenchmarks that can be solved with commonsense priors. We evaluate 53state-of-the-art VLMs on NaturalBench, showing that models likeLLaVA-OneVision, Cambrian-1, Llama3.2-Vision, Molmo, Qwen2-VL, and even GPT-4olag 50%-70% behind human performance (over 90%). We analyze why NaturalBench ishard from two angles: (1) Compositionality: Solving NaturalBench requiresdiverse visio-linguistic skills, including understanding attribute bindings,object relationships, and advanced reasoning like logic and counting. To thisend, unlike prior work that uses a single tag per sample, we tag eachNaturalBench sample with 1 to 8 skill tags for fine-grained evaluation. (2)Biases: NaturalBench exposes severe biases in VLMs, as models often choose thesame answer regardless of the image. Lastly, we apply our benchmark curationmethod to diverse data sources, including long captions (over 100 words) andnon-English languages like Chinese and Hindi, highlighting its potential fordynamic evaluations of VLMs.</description><author>Baiqi Li, Zhiqiu Lin, Wenxuan Peng, Jean de Dieu Nyandwi, Daniel Jiang, Zixian Ma, Simran Khanuja, Ranjay Krishna, Graham Neubig, Deva Ramanan</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:58:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14669v1</guid></item><item><title>MiCEval: Unveiling Multimodal Chain of Thought's Quality via Image Description and Reasoning Steps</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14668v1</link><description>Multimodal Chain of Thought (MCoT) is a popular prompting strategy forimproving the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across arange of complex reasoning tasks. Despite its popularity, there is a notableabsence of automated methods for evaluating the quality of reasoning steps inMCoT. To address this gap, we propose Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Evaluation(MiCEval), a framework designed to assess the correctness of reasoning chainsby evaluating the quality of both the description and each reasoning step. Theevaluation of the description component focuses on the accuracy of the imagedescriptions, while the reasoning step evaluates the quality of each step as itis conditionally generated based on the preceding steps. MiCEval is built upona fine-grained dataset with annotations that rate each step according tocorrectness, relevance, and informativeness. Extensive experiments on fourstate-of-the-art MLLMs show that step-wise evaluations using MiCEval align moreclosely with human judgments compared to existing methods based on cosinesimilarity or fine-tuning approaches.

While most work focuses on improving reconstruction quality,generalization accuracy and robustness are equally important, especially forsafety-critical applications. Model-based architectures (MBAs), such as loopunrolling methods, are considered more interpretable and achieve betterreconstructions. Empirical evidence suggests that MBAs are more robust toperturbations than black-box solvers, but the accuracy-robustness tradeoff inMBAs remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a simple yet effectivetraining scheme for MBAs, called SGD jittering, which injects noiseiteration-wise during reconstruction. We theoretically demonstrate that SGDjittering not only generalizes better than the standard mean squared errortraining but is also more robust to average-case attacks. We validate SGDjittering using denoising toy examples, seismic deconvolution, and single-coilMRI reconstruction. The proposed method achieves cleaner reconstructions forout-of-distribution data and demonstrates enhanced robustness to adversarialattacks.</description><author>Peimeng Guan, Mark A.

Screenplays are not only lengthy, but alsofeature a complex interplay of characters, dialogues, and scenes, with numerousdirect and subtle relationships and contextual nuances that are difficult formachine learning models to accurately capture and comprehend. Recent attemptsat screenplay summarization focus on fine-tuning transformer-based pre-trainedmodels, but these models often fall short in capturing long-term dependenciesand latent relationships, and frequently encounter the "lost in the middle"issue. To address these challenges, we introduce DiscoGraMS, a novel resourcethat represents movie scripts as a movie character-aware discourse graph (CaDGraph). This approach is well-suited for various downstream tasks, such assummarization, question-answering, and salience detection. The model aims topreserve all salient information, offering a more comprehensive and faithfulrepresentation of the screenplay's content. We further explore a baselinemethod that combines the CaD Graph with the corresponding movie script througha late fusion of graph and text modalities, and we present very initialpromising results.</description><author>Maitreya Prafulla Chitale, Uday Bindal, Rajakrishnan Rajkumar, Rahul Mishra</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:56:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14666v1</guid></item><item><title>Online Reinforcement Learning with Passive Memory</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14665v1</link><description>This paper considers an online reinforcement learning algorithm thatleverages pre-collected data (passive memory) from the environment for onlineinteraction.

While previous methods performwell on single-hop fact recall tasks, they consistently struggle with multi-hopfactual recall tasks involving newly edited knowledge. In this paper,leveraging tools in mechanistic interpretability, we first identify that inmulti-hop tasks, LLMs tend to retrieve implicit subject knowledge from deeperMLP layers, unlike single-hop tasks, which rely on earlier layers. Thisdistinction explains the poor performance of current methods in multi-hopqueries, as they primarily focus on editing shallow layers, leaving deeperlayers unchanged. To address this, we propose IFMET, a novel locate-then-editKE approach designed to edit both shallow and deep MLP layers. IFMET employsmulti-hop editing prompts and supplementary sets to locate and modify knowledgeacross different reasoning stages. Experimental results demonstrate that IFMETsignificantly improves performance on multi-hop factual recall tasks,effectively overcoming the limitations of previous locate-then-edit methods.</description><author>Zhuoran Zhang, Yongxiang Li, Zijian Kan, Keyuan Cheng, Lijie Hu, Di Wang</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:53:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06331v2</guid></item><item><title>A Large Language Model-Driven Reward Design Framework via Dynamic Feedback for Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14660v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in designingreward functions for Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. However, obtaininghigh-quality reward code often involves human intervention, numerous LLMqueries, or repetitive RL training. To address these issues, we propose CARD, aLLM-driven Reward Design framework that iteratively generates and improvesreward function code. Specifically, CARD includes a Coder that generates andverifies the code, while a Evaluator provides dynamic feedback to guide theCoder in improving the code, eliminating the need for human feedback. Inaddition to process feedback and trajectory feedback, we introduce TrajectoryPreference Evaluation (TPE), which evaluates the current reward function basedon trajectory preferences. If the code fails the TPE, the Evaluator providespreference feedback, avoiding RL training at every iteration and making thereward function better aligned with the task objective. Empirical results onMeta-World and ManiSkill2 demonstrate that our method achieves an effectivebalance between task performance and token efficiency, outperforming ormatching the baselines across all tasks. On 10 out of 12 tasks, CARD showsbetter or comparable performance to policies trained with expert-designedrewards, and our method even surpasses the oracle on 3 tasks.</description><author>Shengjie Sun, Runze Liu, Jiafei Lyu, Jing-Wen Yang, Liangpeng Zhang, Xiu Li</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:51:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14660v1</guid></item><item><title>Harnessing Causality in Reinforcement Learning With Bagged Decision Times</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14659v1</link><description>We consider reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of problems with baggeddecision times. A bag contains a finite sequence of consecutive decision times.The transition dynamics are non-Markovian and non-stationary within a bag.Further, all actions within a bag jointly impact a single reward, observed atthe end of the bag. Our goal is to construct an online RL algorithm to maximizethe discounted sum of the bag-specific rewards. To handle non-Markoviantransitions within a bag, we utilize an expert-provided causal directed acyclicgraph (DAG). Based on the DAG, we construct the states as a dynamical Bayesiansufficient statistic of the observed history, which results in Markovian statetransitions within and across bags. We then frame this problem as a periodicMarkov decision process (MDP) that allows non-stationarity within a period. Anonline RL algorithm based on Bellman-equations for stationary MDPs isgeneralized to handle periodic MDPs. To justify the proposed RL algorithm, weshow that our constructed state achieves the maximal optimal value functionamong all state constructions for a periodic MDP. Further we prove the Bellmanoptimality equations for periodic MDPs. We evaluate the proposed method ontestbed variants, constructed with real data from a mobile health clinicaltrial.</description><author>Daiqi Gao, Hsin-Yu Lai, Predrag Klasnja, Susan A.

However, many existing methods heavily rely on uniqueuser and item IDs, which limits their ability to perform well in practicalzero-shot learning scenarios where sufficient training data may be unavailable.Inspired by the success of language models (LMs) and their stronggeneralization capabilities, a crucial question arises: How can we harness thepotential of language models to empower recommender systems and elevate itsgeneralization capabilities to new heights? In this study, we propose EasyRec -an effective and easy-to-use approach that seamlessly integrates text-basedsemantic understanding with collaborative signals. EasyRec employs atext-behavior alignment framework, which combines contrastive learning withcollaborative language model tuning, to ensure a strong alignment between thetext-enhanced semantic space and the collaborative behavior information.Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse real-world datasets demonstratethe superior performance of EasyRec compared to state-of-the-art alternativemodels, particularly in the challenging text-based zero-shot recommendationscenarios. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of seamlesslyintegrating EasyRec as a plug-and-play component into text-enhancedcollaborative filtering frameworks, thereby empowering existing recommendersystems to elevate their recommendation performance and adapt to the evolvinguser preferences in dynamic environments.

However, during inferencetime, they are utilized differently, generating text sequentially andauto-regressively by using previously generated tokens as input to predict thenext one. Marginal differences in predictions at each step can cascade oversuccessive steps, resulting in different distributions from what the modelswere trained for and potentially leading to unpredictable behavior. This paperproposes two simple approaches based on model own generation to address thisdiscrepancy between the training and inference time. Our first approach isBatch-Scheduled Sampling, where, during training, we stochastically choosebetween the ground-truth token from the dataset and the model's own generatedtoken as input to predict the next token. This is done in an offline manner,modifying the context window by interleaving ground-truth tokens with thosegenerated by the model. Our second approach is Reference-Answer-basedCorrection, where we explicitly incorporate a self-correction capability intothe model during training. This enables the model to effectively self-correctthe gaps between the generated sequences and the ground truth data withoutrelying on an external oracle model. By incorporating our proposed strategiesduring training, we have observed an overall improvement in performancecompared to baseline methods, as demonstrated by our extensive experimentsusing summarization, general question-answering, and math question-answeringtasks.</description><author>Zhepeng Cen, Yao Liu, Siliang Zeng, Pratik Chaudhar, Huzefa Rangwala, George Karypis, Rasool Fakoor</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:48:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14655v1</guid></item><item><title>Real-time Fake News from Adversarial Feedback</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14651v1</link><description>We show that existing evaluations for fake news detection based onconventional sources, such as claims on fact-checking websites, result in anincreasing accuracy over time for LLM-based detectors -- even after theirknowledge cutoffs.

Instead, we argue that a proper fake newsdetection dataset should test a model's ability to reason factually about thecurrent world by retrieving and reading related evidence. To this end, wedevelop a novel pipeline that leverages natural language feedback from aRAG-based detector to iteratively modify real-time news into deceptive fakenews that challenges LLMs. Our iterative rewrite decreases the binaryclassification AUC by an absolute 17.5 percent for a strong RAG GPT-4odetector.

A new frontier in this area is given by\emph{dynamic, non-uniform} compression methods, which adjust the compressionlevels (e.g., sparsity) per-block or even per-layer in order to minimizeaccuracy loss, while guaranteeing a global compression threshold. Yet, currentmethods rely on heuristics for identifying the "importance" of a given layertowards the loss, based on assumptions such as \emph{error monotonicity}, i.e.that the end-to-end model compression error is proportional to the sum oflayer-wise errors. In this paper, we revisit this area, and propose a new andgeneral approach for dynamic compression that is provably optimal in a giveninput range. We begin from the motivating observation that, in general,\emph{error monotonicity does not hold for LLMs}: compressed models with lowersum of per-layer errors can perform \emph{worse} than models with higher errorsums. To address this, we propose a new general evolutionary framework fordynamic LLM compression called EvoPress, which has provable convergence, andlow sample and evaluation complexity. We show that these theoretical guaranteeslead to highly competitive practical performance for dynamic compression ofLlama, Mistral and Phi models. Via EvoPress, we set new state-of-the-artresults across all compression approaches: structural pruning (block/layerdropping), unstructured sparsity, as well as quantization with dynamicbitwidths.

Genie, a recent model, excels atlearning from visually diverse environments but relies on costlyhuman-collected data. We observe that their alternative method of using randomagents is too limited to explore the environment. We propose to improve themodel by employing reinforcement learning based agents for data generation.This approach produces diverse datasets that enhance the model's ability toadapt and perform well across various scenarios and realistic actions withinthe environment.

Inverse Convolutions areusually used in Normalizing Flows in the sampling pass, making them slow. Wepropose to use Inverse Convolutions in the forward (image to latent vector)pass of the Normalizing flow. Since the sampling pass is the inverse of theforward pass, it will use convolutions only, resulting in efficient samplingtimes. We use our parallel backpropagation algorithm for optimizing the inverseconvolution layer resulting in fast training times also. We implement thisapproach in various Normalizing Flow backbones, resulting in our Inverse-Flowmodels.

However, due to their inherent representation biasesoriginating from different training paradigms, VFMs exhibit advantages anddisadvantages across distinct vision tasks. Although amalgamating the strengthsof multiple VFMs for downstream tasks is an intuitive strategy, effectivelyexploiting these biases remains a significant challenge. In this paper, wepropose a novel and versatile "Swiss Army Knife" (SAK) solution, whichadaptively distills knowledge from a committee of VFMs to enhance multi-tasklearning. Unlike existing methods that use a single backbone for knowledgetransfer, our approach preserves the unique representation bias of each teacherby collaborating the lightweight Teacher-Specific Adapter Path modules with theTeacher-Agnostic Stem.

It iscrucial for reliable decision-making systems to have the capability to cast analert whenever they encounter unfamiliar observations that they are notequipped to handle. In this paper, we propose a novel Mahalanobisdistance-based (MD) anomaly detection framework, called \textit{MDX}, for deepRL algorithms. MDX simultaneously addresses random, adversarial, andout-of-distribution (OOD) state outliers in both offline and online settings.It utilizes Mahalanobis distance within class-conditional distributions foreach action and operates within a statistical hypothesis testing frameworkunder the Gaussian assumption. We further extend it to robust anddistribution-free versions by incorporating Robust MD and conformal inferencetechniques. Through extensive experiments on classical control environments,Atari games, and autonomous driving scenarios, we demonstrate the effectivenessof our MD-based detection framework. MDX offers a simple, unified, andpractical anomaly detection tool for enhancing the safety and reliability of RLsystems in real-world applications.</description><author>Hongming Zhang, Ke Sun, Bo Xu, Linglong Kong, Martin M√ºller</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:32:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09889v3</guid></item><item><title>Diverging Preferences: When do Annotators Disagree and do Models Know?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14632v1</link><description>We examine diverging preferences in human-labeled preference datasets.

We find that the majority of disagreements are in oppositionwith standard reward modeling approaches, which are designed with theassumption that annotator disagreement is noise. We then explore how thesefindings impact two areas of LLM development: reward modeling and evaluation.In our experiments, we demonstrate how standard reward modeling methods, likethe Bradley-Terry model, fail to differentiate whether a given preferencejudgment is the result of unanimous agreement among annotators or the majorityopinion among diverging user preferences. We also find that these tendenciesare also echoed by popular LLM-as-Judge evaluation methods, which consistentlyidentify a winning response in cases of diverging preferences. These findingshighlight remaining challenges in LLM evaluations, which are greatly influencedby divisive features like response style, and in developing pluralisticallyaligned LLMs. To address these issues, we develop methods for identifyingdiverging preferences to mitigate their influence on evaluation and training.</description><author>Michael JQ Zhang, Zhilin Wang, Jena D.

To address this, modern deep learning methodsfor time series analysis combine a shared (global) model with local layers,specific to each time series, often implemented as learnable embeddings.Ideally, these local embeddings should encode meaningful representations of theunique dynamics of each sequence. However, when these are learned end-to-end asparameters of a forecasting model, they may end up acting as mere sequenceidentifiers. Shared processing blocks may then become reliant on suchidentifiers, limiting their transferability to new contexts. In this paper, weaddress this issue by investigating methods to regularize the learning of locallearnable embeddings for time series processing. Specifically, we perform thefirst extensive empirical study on the subject and show how suchregularizations consistently improve performance in widely adoptedarchitectures. Furthermore, we show that methods preventing the co-adaptationof local and global parameters are particularly effective in this context. Thishypothesis is validated by comparing several methods preventing the downstreammodels from relying on sequence identifiers, going as far as completelyresetting the embeddings during training. The obtained results provide animportant contribution to understanding the interplay between learnable localparameters and shared processing layers: a key challenge in modern time seriesprocessing models and a step toward developing effective foundation models fortime series.</description><author>Luca Butera, Giovanni De Felice, Andrea Cini, Cesare Alippi</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:30:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14630v1</guid></item><item><title>SIMformer: Single-Layer Vanilla Transformer Can Learn Free-Space Trajectory Similarity</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14629v1</link><description>Free-space trajectory similarity calculation, e.g., DTW, Hausdorff, andFrechet, often incur quadratic time complexity, thus learning-based methodshave been proposed to accelerate the computation. The core idea is to train anencoder to transform trajectories into representation vectors and then computevector similarity to approximate the ground truth. However, existing methodsface dual challenges of effectiveness and efficiency: 1) they all utilizeEuclidean distance to compute representation similarity, which leads to thesevere curse of dimensionality issue -- reducing the distinguishability amongrepresentations and significantly affecting the accuracy of subsequentsimilarity search tasks; 2) most of them are trained in triplets manner andoften necessitate additional information which downgrades the efficiency; 3)previous studies, while emphasizing the scalability in terms of efficiency,overlooked the deterioration of effectiveness when the dataset size grows. Tocope with these issues, we propose a simple, yet accurate, fast, scalable modelthat only uses a single-layer vanilla transformer encoder as the featureextractor and employs tailored representation similarity functions toapproximate various ground truth similarity measures.

Previously, large language models were criticized forlacking the deeper, more analytical capabilities of System 2. In September2024, OpenAI introduced the o1 model series, designed to handle System 2-likereasoning. While OpenAI's benchmarks are promising, independent validation isstill needed. In this study, we tested the o1-preview model twice on the Dutch'Mathematics B' final exam. It scored a near-perfect 76 and 74 out of 76points. For context, only 24 out of 16,414 students in the Netherlands achieveda perfect score. By comparison, the GPT-4o model scored 66 and 62 out of 76,well above the Dutch average of 40.63 points. Neither model had access to theexam figures. Since there was a risk of model contamination (i.e., theknowledge cutoff of o1-preview and GPT-4o was after the exam was publishedonline), we repeated the procedure with a new Mathematics B exam that waspublished after the cutoff date. The results again indicated that o1-previewperformed strongly (97.8th percentile), which suggests that contamination wasnot a factor. We also show that there is some variability in the output ofo1-preview, which means that sometimes there is 'luck' (the answer is correct)or 'bad luck' (the output has diverged into something that is incorrect). Wedemonstrate that a self-consistency approach, where repeated prompts are givenand the most common answer is selected, is a useful strategy for identifyingthe correct answer. It is concluded that while OpenAI's new model series holdsgreat potential, certain risks must be considered.</description><author>Joost de Winter, Dimitra Dodou, Yke Bauke Eisma</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:30:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07114v2</guid></item><item><title>CELI: Controller-Embedded Language Model Interactions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14627v1</link><description>We introduce Controller-Embedded Language Model Interactions (CELI), aframework that integrates control logic directly within language model (LM)prompts, facilitating complex, multi-stage task execution. CELI addresseslimitations of existing prompt engineering and workflow optimization techniquesby embedding control logic directly within the operational context of languagemodels, enabling dynamic adaptation to evolving task requirements. Ourframework transfers control from the traditional programming executionenvironment to the LMs, allowing them to autonomously manage computationalworkflows while maintaining seamless interaction with external systems andfunctions. CELI supports arbitrary function calls with variable arguments,bridging the gap between LMs' adaptive reasoning capabilities and conventionalsoftware paradigms' structured control mechanisms. To evaluate CELI'sversatility and effectiveness, we conducted case studies in two distinctdomains: code generation (HumanEval benchmark) and multi-stage contentgeneration (Wikipedia-style articles). The results demonstrate notableperformance improvements across a range of domains. CELI achieved a 4.9percentage point improvement over the best reported score of the baseline GPT-4model on the HumanEval code generation benchmark. In multi-stage contentgeneration, 94.4% of CELI-produced Wikipedia-style articles met or exceededfirst draft quality when optimally configured, with 44.4% achieving highquality.

This constitutes an extension of the syren-halofitemulators to incorporate these two effects, which we call syren-new(SYmbolic-Regression-ENhanced power spectrum emulator with NEutrinos and$W_0-w_a$). We also obtain a simple approximation to the derived parameter$\sigma_8$ as a function of the cosmological parameters for these models. Ourresults for the linear power spectrum are designed to emulate CLASS, whereasfor the nonlinear case we aim to match the results of EuclidEmulator2. Wecompare our results to existing emulators and $N$-body simulations. Ouranalytic emulators for $\sigma_8$, the linear and nonlinear power spectraachieve root mean squared errors of 0.1%, 0.3% and 1.3%, respectively, across awide range of cosmological parameters, redshifts and wavenumbers. We verifythat emulator-related discrepancies are subdominant compared to observationalerrors and other modelling uncertainties when computing shear power spectra forLSST-like surveys.

In this work, we argue that these embeddings, whileeffective, are implicitly out-of-context for targeted use cases of retrieval,and that a contextualized document embedding should take into account both thedocument and neighboring documents in context - analogous to contextualizedword embeddings. We propose two complementary methods for contextualizeddocument embeddings: first, an alternative contrastive learning objective thatexplicitly incorporates the document neighbors into the intra-batch contextualloss; second, a new contextual architecture that explicitly encodes neighbordocument information into the encoded representation. Results show that bothmethods achieve better performance than biencoders in several settings, withdifferences especially pronounced out-of-domain.

However, thelearnability of these simulators from observational data has remained an openquestion. Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-timelearnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) forsingle-layer Transformers with linear attention. We show that linear attentionmay be viewed as a linear predictor in a suitably defined RKHS. As aconsequence, the problem of learning any linear transformer may be convertedinto the problem of learning an ordinary linear predictor in an expandedfeature space, and any such predictor may be converted back into a multiheadedlinear transformer. Moving to generalization, we show how to efficientlyidentify training datasets for which every empirical risk minimizer isequivalent (up to trivial symmetries) to the linear Transformer that generatedthe data, thereby guaranteeing the learned model will correctly generalizeacross all inputs. Finally, we provide examples of computations expressible vialinear attention and therefore polynomial-time learnable, including associativememories, finite automata, and a class of Universal Turing Machine (UTMs) withpolynomially bounded computation histories. We empirically validate ourtheoretical findings on three tasks: learning random linear attention networks,key--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata.

Here,we present a benchmark of both well-used and emerging DRL algorithms in anavigation task with configurable sensor denial effects. In particular, we areinterested in comparing how different DRL methods (e.g. model-free PPO vs.model-based DreamerV3) are affected by sensor denial. We show that DreamerV3outperforms other methods in the visual end-to-end navigation task with adynamic goal - and other methods are not able to learn this. Furthermore,DreamerV3 generally outperforms other methods in sensor-denied environments. Inorder to improve robustness, we use adversarial training and demonstrate animproved performance in denied environments, although this generally comes witha performance cost on the vanilla environments. We anticipate this benchmark ofdifferent DRL methods and the usage of adversarial training to be a startingpoint for the development of more elaborate navigation strategies that arecapable of dealing with uncertain and denied sensor readings.</description><author>Mariusz Wisniewski, Paraskevas Chatzithanos, Weisi Guo, Antonios Tsourdos</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:14:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14616v1</guid></item><item><title>Asymptotically Optimal Change Detection for Unnormalized Pre- and Post-Change Distributions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14615v1</link><description>This paper addresses the problem of detecting changes when only unnormalizedpre- and post-change distributions are accessible. This situation happens inmany scenarios in physics such as in ferromagnetism, crystallography,magneto-hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics, where the energy models aredifficult to normalize. Our approach is based on the estimation of the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM)statistics, which is known to produce optimal performance. We first present anintuitively appealing approximation method. Unfortunately, this produces abiased estimator of the CUSUM statistics and may cause performance degradation.We then propose the Log-Partition Approximation Cumulative Sum (LPA-CUSUM)algorithm based on thermodynamic integration (TI) in order to estimate thelog-ratio of normalizing constants of pre- and post-change distributions. It isproved that this approach gives an unbiased estimate of the log-partitionfunction and the CUSUM statistics, and leads to an asymptotically optimalperformance. Moreover, we derive a relationship between the required samplesize for thermodynamic integration and the desired detection delay performance,offering guidelines for practical parameter selection.

Our experiments on a number of text classification benchmarks showthat AICL substantially outperforms standard ICL by up to 17%.</description><author>Manish Chandra, Debasis Ganguly, Iadh Ounis</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:10:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06402v2</guid></item><item><title>Modular Boundaries in Recurrent Neural Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20601v2</link><description>Recent theoretical and experimental work in neuroscience has focused on therepresentational and dynamical character of neural manifolds --subspaces inneural activity space wherein many neurons coactivate. Importantly, neuralpopulations studied under this "neural manifold hypothesis" are continuous andnot cleanly divided into separate neural populations. This perspective clasheswith the "modular hypothesis" of brain organization, wherein neural elementsmaintain an "all-or-nothing" affiliation with modules. In line with thismodular hypothesis, recent research on recurrent neural networks suggests thatmulti-task networks become modular across training, such that different modulesspecialize for task-general dynamical motifs. If the modular hypothesis istrue, then it would be important to use a dimensionality reduction techniquethat captures modular structure. Here, we investigate the features of such amethod. We leverage RNNs as a model system to study the character of modularneural populations, using a community detection method from network scienceknown as modularity maximization to partition neurons into distinct modules.These partitions allow us to ask the following question: do these modularboundaries matter to the system? ...</description><author>Jacob Tanner, Sina Mansour L., Ludovico Coletta, Alessandro Gozzi, Richard F.

With the explosion of Large Language Models(LLMs), the CS field has seen major improvements with LLMs rewriting userqueries, accounting for conversational context. However, engaging LLMs atinference time harms efficiency. Current methods address this by distillingembeddings from human-rewritten queries to learn the context modeling task.Yet, these approaches predominantly focus on context modeling, and only treatthe contrastive component of the retrieval task within adistillation-independent loss term. To address these limitations, we propose anew distillation method, as a relaxation of the previous objective, unifyingretrieval and context modeling. We relax the existing training objectives bydistilling similarity scores between conversations and documents, rather thanrelying solely on representation learning. Our proposed distillation objectiveallows for more freedom in the representation space and leverages thecontrastive nature of document relevance. Through experiments on Learned SparseRetrieval (LSR) across 5 CS datasets, our approach demonstrates substantialimprovements in both in-domain and out-of-domain retrieval performance,outperforming state-of-the-art with gains of up to 6 points in recall forout-of-domain datasets. Additionally, through the relaxation of the objective,we propose a multi-teacher distillation, using multiple LLMs as teachers,yielding additional gains, and outperforming the teachers themselves inin-domain experiments. Finally, analysis of the sparsity of the models revealsthat our distillation allows for better control over the sparsity of thetrained models.</description><author>Simon Lupart, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Evangelos Kanoulas</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 17:03:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14609v1</guid></item><item><title>Streaming Deep Reinforcement Learning Finally Works</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14606v1</link><description>Natural intelligence processes experience as a continuous stream, sensing,acting, and learning moment-by-moment in real time. Streaming learning, themodus operandi of classic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms likeQ-learning and TD, mimics natural learning by using the most recent samplewithout storing it. This approach is also ideal for resource-constrained,communication-limited, and privacy-sensitive applications. However, in deep RL,learners almost always use batch updates and replay buffers, making themcomputationally expensive and incompatible with streaming learning. Althoughthe prevalence of batch deep RL is often attributed to its sample efficiency, amore critical reason for the absence of streaming deep RL is its frequentinstability and failure to learn, which we refer to as stream barrier. Thispaper introduces the stream-x algorithms, the first class of deep RL algorithmsto overcome stream barrier for both prediction and control and match sampleefficiency of batch RL. Through experiments in Mujoco Gym, DM Control Suite,and Atari Games, we demonstrate stream barrier in existing algorithms andsuccessful stable learning with our stream-x algorithms: stream Q, stream AC,and stream TD, achieving the best model-free performance in DM Control Dogenvironments. A set of common techniques underlies the stream-x algorithms,enabling their success with a single set of hyperparameters and allowing foreasy extension to other algorithms, thereby reviving streaming RL.</description><author>Mohamed Elsayed, Gautham Vasan, A.

Their results reveal an intricateempirical correlation between node classification accuracy and the ratio ofsmooth to non-smooth feature components. However, the optimal ratio that favorsnode classification is unknown, and the non-smooth features of deep GCN withReLU or leaky ReLU activation function diminish. In this paper, we propose anew strategy to let GCN learn node features with a desired smoothness --adapting to data and tasks -- to enhance node classification. Our approach hasthree key steps: (1) We establish a geometric relationship between the inputand output of ReLU or leaky ReLU. (2) Building on our geometric insights, weaugment the message-passing process of graph convolutional layers (GCLs) with alearnable term to modulate the smoothness of node features with computationalefficiency.

While regularization methods (i.e., dropoutand weight decay) are geared toward adjusting model parameters to preventoverfitting, data augmentation increases the diversity of the input trainingset, a method purported to improve accuracy and calibration error. In thispaper, we investigate the impact of each of these techniques on the parameterspace of neural networks, with the goal of understanding how they alter theweight landscape in transfer learning scenarios. To accomplish this, we employRandom Matrix Theory to analyze the eigenvalue distributions of pre-trainedmodels, fine-tuned using these techniques but using different levels of datadiversity, for the same downstream tasks. We observe that diverse datainfluences the weight landscape in a similar fashion as dropout. Additionally,we compare commonly used data augmentation methods with synthetic data createdby generative models. We conclude that synthetic data can bring more diversityinto real input data, resulting in a better performance on out-of-distributiontest instances.</description><author>Yang Ba, Michelle V.

We take a firststep towards defending models against persuasion while also arguing thatdefense against adversarial (i.e. negative) persuasion is only half of theequation: models should also be able to accept beneficial (i.e. positive)persuasion to improve their answers. We show that optimizing models for onlyone side results in poor performance on the other. In order to balance positiveand negative persuasion, we introduce Persuasion-Balanced Training (or PBT),which leverages multi-agent recursive dialogue trees to create data and trainsmodels via preference optimization to accept persuasion when appropriate. PBTconsistently improves resistance to misinformation and resilience to beingchallenged while also resulting in the best overall performance on holisticdata containing both positive and negative persuasion. Crucially, we show thatPBT models are better teammates in multi-agent debates. We find that withoutPBT, pairs of stronger and weaker models have unstable performance, with theorder in which the models present their answers determining whether the teamobtains the stronger or weaker model's performance. PBT leads to better andmore stable results and less order dependence, with the stronger modelconsistently pulling the weaker one up.</description><author>Elias Stengel-Eskin, Peter Hase, Mohit Bansal</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 16:49:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14596v1</guid></item><item><title>DRACO-DehazeNet: An Efficient Image Dehazing Network Combining Detail Recovery and a Novel Contrastive Learning Paradigm</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14595v1</link><description>Image dehazing is crucial for clarifying images obscured by haze or fog, butcurrent learning-based approaches is dependent on large volumes of trainingdata and hence consumed significant computational power.

Previous work on online fairdivision has shown impossibility results in achieving approximate envy-freenessunder these constraints. In contrast, we consider an informed setting where thealgorithm has complete knowledge of future items, and aim to ensure that thecumulative allocation at each round satisfies approximate envy-freeness --which we define as temporal envy-freeness up to one item (TEF1). We focus onsettings where items can be exclusively goods or exclusively chores. For goods,while TEF1 allocations may not always exist, we identify several special caseswhere they do -- two agents, two item types, generalized binary valuations,unimodal preferences -- and provide polynomial-time algorithms for these cases.We also prove that determining the existence of a TEF1 allocation is NP-hard.For chores, we establish analogous results for the special cases, but present aslightly weaker intractability result. We also establish the incompatibilitybetween TEF1 and Pareto-optimality, with the implication that it is intractableto find a TEF1 allocation that maximizes any $p$-mean welfare, even for twoagents.</description><author>Edith Elkind, Alexander Lam, Mohamad Latifian, Tzeh Yuan Neoh, Nicholas Teh</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 16:43:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14593v1</guid></item><item><title>Contractivity and linear convergence in bilinear saddle-point problems: An operator-theoretic approach</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14592v1</link><description>We study the convex-concave bilinear saddle-point problem $\min_x \max_y f(x)+ y^\top Ax - g(y)$, where both, only one, or none of the functions $f$ and $g$are strongly convex, and suitable rank conditions on the matrix $A$ hold.

But what constitutes ameaningful subpopulation? In this work, we take the perspective that relevantsubpopulations should be defined with respect to the clusters that naturallyemerge from the distribution of individuals for which predictions are beingmade. In this view, a population refers to a mixture model whose componentsconstitute the relevant subpopulations. We suggest two formalisms for capturingper-subgroup guarantees: first, by attributing each individual to the componentfrom which they were most likely drawn, given their features; and second, byattributing each individual to all components in proportion to their relativelikelihood of having been drawn from each component. Using online calibrationas a case study, we study a \variational algorithm that provides guarantees foreach of these formalisms by handling all plausible underlying subpopulationstructures simultaneously, and achieve an $O(T^{1/2})$ rate even when thesubpopulations are not well-separated. In comparison, the more naturalcluster-then-predict approach that first recovers the structure of thesubpopulations and then makes predictions suffers from a $O(T^{2/3})$ rate andrequires the subpopulations to be separable. Along the way, we prove thatproviding per-subgroup calibration guarantees for underlying clusters can beeasier than learning the clusters: separation between median subgroup featuresis required for the latter but not the former.</description><author>Jessica Dai, Nika Haghtalab, Eric Zhao</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 16:38:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14588v1</guid></item><item><title>Neuro-Symbolic Traders: Assessing the Wisdom of AI Crowds in Markets</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14587v1</link><description>Deep generative models are becoming increasingly used as tools for financialanalysis.

The agent's goalis to simultaneously learn the unknown reward functions and choose thehighest-reward arms. For example, the "reward" may represent a user'sprobability of clicking on one of the recommended products. Conventional banditmodels, however, employ restrictive reward function models in order to obtainperformance guarantees. We make use of deep neural networks to estimate andlearn the unknown reward functions and propose Neural UCB Clustering(NeUClust), which adopts a clustering approach to select the super arm in everyround by exploiting underlying structure in the context space. Unlike priorneural bandit works, NeUClust uses a neural network to estimate the super armreward and select the super arm, thus eliminating the need for a knownoptimization oracle. We non-trivially extend prior neural combinatorial banditworks to prove that NeUClust achieves$\widetilde{O}\left(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{T}\right)$ regret, where $\widetilde{d}$is the effective dimension of a neural tangent kernel matrix, $T$ the number ofrounds. Experiments on real world recommendation datasets show that NeUClustachieves better regret and reward than other contextual combinatorial andneural bandit algorithms.</description><author>Baran Atalar, Carlee Joe-Wong</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 16:37:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14586v1</guid></item><item><title>MCSFF: Multi-modal Consistency and Specificity Fusion Framework for Entity Alignment</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14584v1</link><description>Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) is essential for enhancing knowledgegraphs and improving information retrieval and question-answering systems.Existing methods often focus on integrating modalities through theircomplementarity but overlook the specificity of each modality, which canobscure crucial features and reduce alignment accuracy.

However,recent studies have shown significant limitations in LLMs'instruction-following capabilities, raising concerns about their reliability inhigh-stakes applications. Accurately estimating LLMs' uncertainty in adheringto instructions is critical to mitigating deployment risks. We present, to ourknowledge, the first systematic evaluation of the uncertainty estimationabilities of LLMs in the context of instruction-following. Our study identifieskey challenges with existing instruction-following benchmarks, where multiplefactors are entangled with uncertainty stems from instruction-following,complicating the isolation and comparison across methods and models. To addressthese issues, we introduce a controlled evaluation setup with two benchmarkversions of data, enabling a comprehensive comparison of uncertainty estimationmethods under various conditions. Our findings show that existing uncertaintymethods struggle, particularly when models make subtle errors in instructionfollowing. While internal model states provide some improvement, they remaininadequate in more complex scenarios.

In this paper, we investigate the convergence propertiesand implicit biases of a family of MD algorithms tailored for softmax attentionmechanisms, with the potential function chosen as the $p$-th power of the$\ell_p$-norm. Specifically, we show that these algorithms converge indirection to a generalized hard-margin SVM with an $\ell_p$-norm objective whenapplied to a classification problem using a softmax attention model. Notably,our theoretical results reveal that the convergence rate is comparable to thatof traditional GD in simpler models, despite the highly nonlinear and nonconvexnature of the present problem. Additionally, we delve into the jointoptimization dynamics of the key-query matrix and the decoder, establishingconditions under which this complex joint optimization converges to theirrespective hard-margin SVM solutions. Lastly, our numerical experiments on realdata demonstrate that MD algorithms improve generalization over standard GD andexcel in optimal token selection.</description><author>Aaron Alvarado Kristanto Julistiono, Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Navid Azizan</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 16:32:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14581v1</guid></item><item><title>Harnessing Shared Relations via Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17777v2</link><description>Deep multimodal learning has shown remarkable success by leveragingcontrastive learning to capture explicit one-to-one relations acrossmodalities.

Our key contribution is a Mixup-based contrastive loss that learns robustrepresentations by aligning mixed samples from one modality with theircorresponding samples from other modalities thereby capturing shared relationsbetween them. For multimodal classification tasks, we introduce a frameworkthat integrates a fusion module with unimodal prediction modules for auxiliarysupervision during training, complemented by our proposed Mixup-basedcontrastive loss. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets (N24News,ROSMAP, BRCA, and Food-101), we demonstrate that M3CoL effectively capturesshared multimodal relations and generalizes across domains.

However, theirlarge size balloons inference time and memory requirements. In this paper, weshow that by pruning the last $p\%$ layers of an LLM before supervised trainingfor only 1000 steps, we can achieve a proportional reduction in memory andinference time. We evaluate four different state-of-the-art LLMs on textembedding tasks and find that our method can prune up to 30\% of layers withnegligible impact on performance and up to 80\% with only a modest drop. Withonly three lines of code, our method is easily implemented in any pipeline fortransforming LLMs to text encoders. We also propose $\text{L}^3 \text{Prune}$,a novel layer-pruning strategy based on the model's initial loss that providestwo optimal pruning configurations: a large variant with negligible performanceloss and a small variant for resource-constrained settings. On average, thelarge variant prunes 21\% of the parameters with a $-0.3$ performance drop, andthe small variant only suffers from a $-5.1$ decrease while pruning 74\% of themodel.

Compared to frame-based camera, a noveltype of bio-inspired visual sensor, i.e. event camera, has demonstratedadvantages in high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low powerconsumption and low latency. Due to its unique asynchronous and irregular datacapturing process, limited work has been proposed to apply neuralrepresentation or 3D Gaussian splatting for an event camera. In this work, wepresent IncEventGS, an incremental 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstructionalgorithm with a single event camera. To recover the 3D scene representationincrementally, we exploit the tracking and mapping paradigm of conventionalSLAM pipelines for IncEventGS. Given the incoming event stream, the trackerfirstly estimates an initial camera motion based on prior reconstructed 3D-GSscene representation. The mapper then jointly refines both the 3D scenerepresentation and camera motion based on the previously estimated motiontrajectory from the tracker. The experimental results demonstrate thatIncEventGS delivers superior performance compared to prior NeRF-based methodsand other related baselines, even we do not have the ground-truth camera poses.Furthermore, our method can also deliver better performance compared tostate-of-the-art event visual odometry methods in terms of camera motionestimation.

To address these challenges, we develop MMC+,an enhanced framework for scalable drift monitoring, building upon theCheXstray framework that introduced real-time drift detection for medicalimaging AI models using multi-modal data concordance. This work extends theoriginal framework's methodologies, providing a more scalable and adaptablesolution for real-world healthcare settings and offers a reliable andcost-effective alternative to continuous performance monitoring addressinglimitations of both continuous and periodic monitoring methods. MMC+ introducescritical improvements to the original framework, including more robust handlingof diverse data streams, improved scalability with the integration offoundation models like MedImageInsight for high-dimensional image embeddingswithout site-specific training, and the introduction of uncertainty bounds tobetter capture drift in dynamic clinical environments. Validated withreal-world data from Massachusetts General Hospital during the COVID-19pandemic, MMC+ effectively detects significant data shifts and correlates themwith model performance changes. While not directly predicting performancedegradation, MMC+ serves as an early warning system, indicating when AI systemsmay deviate from acceptable performance bounds and enabling timelyinterventions. By emphasizing the importance of monitoring diverse data streamsand evaluating data shifts alongside model performance, this work contributesto the broader adoption and integration of AI solutions in clinical settings.</description><author>Jameson Merkow, Felix J.

SMoE has the potential to exponentially increaseparameter count while maintaining the efficiency of the model by onlyactivating a small subset of these parameters for a given sample. However, ithas been observed that SMoE suffers from unstable training and has difficultyadapting to new distributions, leading to the model's lack of robustness todata contamination. To overcome these limitations, we first establish aconnection between the dynamics of the expert representations in SMoEs andgradient descent on a multi-objective optimization problem. Leveraging ourframework, we then integrate momentum into SMoE and propose a new family ofSMoEs named MomentumSMoE. We theoretically prove and numerically demonstratethat MomentumSMoE is more stable and robust than SMoE. In particular, we verifythe advantages of MomentumSMoE over SMoE on a variety of practical tasksincluding ImageNet-1K object recognition and WikiText-103 language modeling. Wedemonstrate the applicability of MomentumSMoE to many types of SMoE models,including those in the Sparse MoE model for vision (V-MoE) and the GeneralistLanguage Model (GLaM). We also show that other advanced momentum-basedoptimization methods, such as Adam, can be easily incorporated into theMomentumSMoE framework for designing new SMoE models with even betterperformance, almost negligible additional computation cost, and simpleimplementations.</description><author>Rachel S.

Basedon this review, we formulate three desirable properties (axioms) of a reliablediversity measure: monotonicity, uniqueness, and continuity.

We perform multiple experiments, includingreplicating the classic Kiki-Bouba and Mil-Mal shape and magnitude symbolismtasks, and comparing human judgements of linguistic iconicity with that ofLLMs. Our results show that VLMs demonstrate varying levels of agreement withhuman labels, and more task information may be required for VLMs versus theirhuman counterparts for in silico experimentation. We additionally see throughhigher maximum agreement levels that Magnitude Symbolism is an easier patternfor VLMs to identify than Shape Symbolism, and that an understanding oflinguistic iconicity is highly dependent on model size.</description><author>Tyler Loakman, Yucheng Li, Chenghua Lin</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 15:42:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14917v2</guid></item><item><title>Fundus to Fluorescein Angiography Video Generation as a Retinal Generative Foundation Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13242v2</link><description>Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) is crucial for diagnosing and monitoringretinal vascular issues but is limited by its invasive nature and restrictedaccessibility compared to color fundus (CF) imaging. Existing methods thatconvert CF images to FFA are confined to static image generation, missing thedynamic lesional changes. We introduce Fundus2Video, an autoregressivegenerative adversarial network (GAN) model that generates dynamic FFA videosfrom single CF images. Fundus2Video excels in video generation, achieving anFVD of 1497.12 and a PSNR of 11.77. Clinical experts have validated thefidelity of the generated videos. Additionally, the model's generatordemonstrates remarkable downstream transferability across ten external publicdatasets, including blood vessel segmentation, retinal disease diagnosis,systemic disease prediction, and multimodal retrieval, showcasing impressivezero-shot and few-shot capabilities. These findings position Fundus2Video as apowerful, non-invasive alternative to FFA exams and a versatile retinalgenerative foundation model that captures both static and temporal retinalfeatures, enabling the representation of complex inter-modality relationships.</description><author>Weiyi Zhang, Jiancheng Yang, Ruoyu Chen, Siyu Huang, Pusheng Xu, Xiaolan Chen, Shanfu Lu, Hongyu Cao, Mingguang He, Danli Shi</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 15:41:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13242v2</guid></item><item><title>Tell me what I need to know: Exploring LLM-based (Personalized) Abstractive Multi-Source Meeting Summarization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14545v1</link><description>Meeting summarization is crucial in digital communication, but existingsolutions struggle with salience identification to generate personalized,workable summaries, and context understanding to fully comprehend the meetings'content. Previous attempts to address these issues by considering relatedsupplementary resources (e.g., presentation slides) alongside transcripts arehindered by models' limited context sizes and handling the additionalcomplexities of the multi-source tasks, such as identifying relevantinformation in additional files and seamlessly aligning it with the meetingcontent. This work explores multi-source meeting summarization consideringsupplementary materials through a three-stage large language model approach:identifying transcript passages needing additional context, inferring relevantdetails from supplementary materials and inserting them into the transcript,and generating a summary from this enriched transcript. Our multi-sourceapproach enhances model understanding, increasing summary relevance by ~9% andproducing more content-rich outputs. We introduce a personalization protocolthat extracts participant characteristics and tailors summaries accordingly,improving informativeness by ~10%. This work further provides insights onperformance-cost trade-offs across four leading model families, includingedge-device capable options. Our approach can be extended to similar complexgenerative tasks benefitting from additional resources and personalization,such as dialogue systems and action planning.</description><author>Frederic Kirstein, Terry Ruas, Robert Kratel, Bela Gipp</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 15:40:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14545v1</guid></item><item><title>Crossroads of Continents: Automated Artifact Extraction for Cultural Adaptation with Large Multimodal Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02067v2</link><description>We present a comprehensive three-phase study to examine (1) the culturalunderstanding of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) by introducing DalleStreet, alarge-scale dataset generated by DALL-E 3 and validated by humans, containing9,935 images of 67 countries and 10 concept classes; (2) the underlyingimplicit and potentially stereotypical cultural associations with a culturalartifact extraction task; and (3) an approach to adapt cultural representationin an image based on extracted associations using a modular pipeline,CultureAdapt.

This motivates the objective ofdiscovering typical care pathways from patient data. Revealing typical carepathways can be achieved through clustering. The difficulty in clustering carepathways, represented by sequences of timestamped events, lies in defining asemantically appropriate metric and clustering algorithms. In this article, weadapt two methods developed for time series to the clustering of timedsequences: the drop-DTW metric and the DBA approach for the construction ofaveraged time sequences.

While new techniques are introduced regularly, theirevaluation uses metrics not designed to capture meeting-specific errors,undermining effective evaluation. This paper investigates what the frequentlyused automatic metrics capture and which errors they mask by correlatingautomatic metric scores with human evaluations across a broad error taxonomy.We commence with a comprehensive literature review on English meetingsummarization to define key challenges like speaker dynamics and contextualturn-taking and error types such as missing information and linguisticinaccuracy, concepts previously loosely defined in the field. We examine therelationship between characteristic challenges and errors by using annotatedtranscripts and summaries from Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence andautoregressive models from the general summary QMSum dataset. Throughexperimental validation, we find that different model architectures respondvariably to challenges in meeting transcripts, resulting in differentpronounced links between challenges and errors. Current default-used metricsstruggle to capture observable errors, showing weak to mid-correlations, whilea third of the correlations show trends of error masking. Only a subset reactsaccurately to specific errors, while most correlations show eitherunresponsiveness or failure to reflect the error's impact on summary quality.</description><author>Frederic Kirstein, Jan Philip Wahle, Terry Ruas, Bela Gipp</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 15:34:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11124v2</guid></item><item><title>Multi-modal Pose Diffuser: A Multimodal Generative Conditional Pose Prior</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14540v1</link><description>The Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model plays a crucial role in 3D humanpose estimation, providing a streamlined yet effective representation of thehuman body.

MOPED is the first method to leverage a novel multi-modalconditional diffusion model as a prior for SMPL pose parameters. Our methodoffers powerful unconditional pose generation with the ability to condition onmulti-modal inputs such as images and text. This capability enhances theapplicability of our approach by incorporating additional context oftenoverlooked in traditional pose priors. Extensive experiments across threedistinct tasks-pose estimation, pose denoising, and pose completion-demonstratethat our multi-modal diffusion model-based prior significantly outperformsexisting methods.

Traditional spectral algorithms often fall shortin such contexts, primarily due to the reliance on predetermined kernelfunctions, which inadequately address the complex structures inherent inmanifold-based data. By employing graph Laplacian approximation, our methoduses the local estimation property of heat kernel, offering an adaptive,data-driven approach to overcome this obstacle. Another distinct advantage ofour algorithm lies in its semi-supervised learning framework, enabling it tofully use the additional unlabeled data. This ability enhances the performanceby allowing the algorithm to dig the spectrum and curvature of the datamanifold, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the dataset.Moreover, our algorithm performs in an entirely data-driven manner, operatingdirectly within the intrinsic manifold structure of the data, without requiringany predefined manifold information. We provide a convergence analysis of ouralgorithm. Our findings reveal that the algorithm achieves a convergence ratethat depends solely on the intrinsic dimension of the underlying manifold,thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality associated with the higher ambientdimension.</description><author>Weichun Xia, Jiaxin Jiang, Lei Shi</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 15:29:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14539v1</guid></item><item><title>On Debiasing Text Embeddings Through Context Injection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12874v2</link><description>Current advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have made itincreasingly feasible to build applications leveraging textual data. Generally,the core of these applications rely on having a good semantic representation oftext into vectors, via embedding models. However, it has been shown that theseembeddings capture and perpetuate biases already present in text. While a fewtechniques have been proposed to debias embeddings, they do not take advantageof the recent advances in context understanding of modern embedding models. Inthis paper, we fill this gap by conducting a review of 19 embedding models byquantifying their biases and how well they respond to context injection as amean of debiasing. We show that higher performing models are more prone tocapturing biases, but are also better at incorporating context. Surprisingly,we find that while models can easily embed affirmative semantics, they fail atembedding neutral semantics. Finally, in a retrieval task, we show that biasesin embeddings can lead to non-desirable outcomes. We use our new-found insightsto design a simple algorithm for top $k$ retrieval, where $k$ is dynamicallyselected. We show that our algorithm is able to retrieve all relevant genderedand neutral chunks.</description><author>Thomas Uriot</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 15:26:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12874v2</guid></item><item><title>Train &amp; Constrain: Phonologically Informed Tongue-Twister Generation from Topics and Paraphrases</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13901v3</link><description>Previous work in phonologically and phonetically grounded language generationhas mainly focused on domains such as puns and poetry.

Traditionally, leukemia isdiagnosed by analyzing blood and bone marrow smears under a microscope, withadditional cytochemical tests for confirmation. However, these methods areexpensive, time consuming, and highly dependent on expert knowledge. In recentyears, deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), hasprovided advanced methods for classifying microscopic smear images, aiding inthe detection of leukemic cells. These approaches are quick, cost effective,and not subject to human bias. However, most methods lack the ability toquantify uncertainty, which could lead to critical misdiagnoses. In thisresearch, hybrid deep learning models (InceptionV3-GRU, EfficientNetB3-GRU,MobileNetV2-GRU) were implemented to classify ALL. Bayesian optimization wasused to fine tune the model's hyperparameters and improve its performance.Additionally, Deep Ensemble uncertainty quantification was applied to addressuncertainty during leukemia image classification. The proposed models weretrained on the publicly available datasets ALL-IDB1 and ALL-IDB2. Their resultswere then aggregated at the score level using the sum rule. The parallelarchitecture used in these models offers a high level of confidence indifferentiating between ALL and non-ALL cases. The proposed method achieved aremarkable detection accuracy rate of 100% on the ALL-IDB1 dataset, 98.07% onthe ALL-IDB2 dataset, and 98.64% on the combined dataset, demonstrating itspotential for accurate and reliable leukemia diagnosis.</description><author>Maksuda Akter, Rabea Khatun, Md Manowarul Islam</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 15:23:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14536v1</guid></item><item><title>Comparing Differentiable and Dynamic Ray Tracing: Introducing the Multipath Lifetime Map</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14535v1</link><description>With the increasing presence of dynamic scenarios, such as Vehicle-to-Vehiclecommunications, radio propagation modeling tools must adapt to the rapidlychanging nature of the radio channel.

Comprehensive error classification methods, such as MultidimensionalQuality Metrics (MQM), are expensive as they are time-consuming and can only bedone by experts, whose availability may be limited especially for low-resourcelanguages. On the other hand, just assigning overall scores, like DirectAssessment (DA), is simpler and faster and can be done by translators of anylevel, but is less reliable. In this paper, we introduce Error Span Annotation(ESA), a human evaluation protocol which combines the continuous rating of DAwith the high-level error severity span marking of MQM. We validate ESA bycomparing it to MQM and DA for 12 MT systems and one human referencetranslation (English to German) from WMT23. The results show that ESA offersfaster and cheaper annotations than MQM at the same quality level, without therequirement of expensive MQM experts.</description><author>Tom Kocmi, Vil√©m Zouhar, Eleftherios Avramidis, Roman Grundkiewicz, Marzena Karpinska, Maja Popoviƒá, Mrinmaya Sachan, Mariya Shmatova</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 15:20:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11580v2</guid></item><item><title>Kernel Density Estimators in Large Dimensions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05807v3</link><description>This paper studies Kernel Density Estimation for a high-dimensionaldistribution $\rho(x)$. Traditional approaches have focused on the limit oflarge number of data points $n$ and fixed dimension $d$. We analyze instead theregime where both the number $n$ of data points $y_i$ and their dimensionality$d$ grow with a fixed ratio $\alpha=(\log n)/d$. Our study reveals threedistinct statistical regimes for the kernel-based estimate of the density $\hat\rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)=\frac{1}{n h^d}\sum_{i=1}^nK\left(\frac{x-y_i}{h}\right)$, depending on the bandwidth $h$: a classicalregime for large bandwidth where the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds, whichis akin to the one found in traditional approaches. Below a certain value ofthe bandwidth, $h_{CLT}(\alpha)$, we find that the CLT breaks down. Thestatistics of $\hat\rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ for a fixed $x$ drawn from$\rho(x)$ is given by a heavy-tailed distribution (an alpha-stabledistribution). In particular below a value $h_G(\alpha)$, we find that$\hat\rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ is governed by extreme value statistics: only afew points in the database matter and give the dominant contribution to thedensity estimator. We provide a detailed analysis for high-dimensionalmultivariate Gaussian data. We show that the optimal bandwidth threshold basedon Kullback-Leibler divergence lies in the new statistical regime identified inthis paper. As known by practitioners, when decreasing the bandwidth aKernel-estimated estimated changes from a smooth curve to a collections ofpeaks centred on the data points. Our findings reveal that this generalphenomenon is related to sharp transitions between phases characterized bydifferent statistical properties, and offer new insights for Kernel densityestimation in high-dimensional settings.</description><author>Giulio Biroli, Marc M√©zard</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 15:19:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05807v3</guid></item><item><title>The Traveling Bandit: A Framework for Bayesian Optimization with Movement Costs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14533v1</link><description>This paper introduces a framework for Bayesian Optimization (BO) with metricmovement costs, addressing a critical challenge in practical applications whereinput alterations incur varying costs.

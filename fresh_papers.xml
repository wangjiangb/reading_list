Furthermore, when seamlessly integratedinto an embodied agent, it signifies a crucial stride towards the creation ofautonomous and context-aware systems capable of formulating plans and executingcommands with precision. In this paper, we introduce Octopus, a novel VLMdesigned to proficiently decipher an agent's vision and textual task objectivesand to formulate intricate action sequences and generate executable code. Ourdesign allows the agent to adeptly handle a wide spectrum of tasks, rangingfrom mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions incomplex video games. Octopus is trained by leveraging GPT-4 to control anexplorative agent to generate training data, i.e., action blueprints and thecorresponding executable code, within our experimental environment calledOctoVerse. We also collect the feedback that allows the enhanced trainingscheme of Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through aseries of experiments, we illuminate Octopus's functionality and presentcompelling results, and the proposed RLEF turns out to refine the agent'sdecision-making. By open-sourcing our model architecture, simulator, anddataset, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborativeapplications within the broader embodied AI community.</description><author>Jingkang Yang, Yuhao Dong, Shuai Liu, Bo Li, Ziyue Wang, Chencheng Jiang, Haoran Tan, Jiamu Kang, Yuanhan Zhang, Kaiyang Zhou, Ziwei Liu</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:59:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08588v1</guid></item><item><title>Is Generalized Dynamic Novel View Synthesis from Monocular Videos Possible Today?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08587v1</link><description>Rendering scenes observed in a monocular video from novel viewpoints is achallenging problem. For static scenes the community has studied bothscene-specific optimization techniques, which optimize on every test scene, andgeneralized techniques, which only run a deep net forward pass on a test scene.In contrast, for dynamic scenes, scene-specific optimization techniques exist,but, to our best knowledge, there is currently no generalized method fordynamic novel view synthesis from a given monocular video. To answer whethergeneralized dynamic novel view synthesis from monocular videos is possibletoday, we establish an analysis framework based on existing techniques and worktoward the generalized approach. We find a pseudo-generalized process withoutscene-specific appearance optimization is possible, but geometrically andtemporally consistent depth estimates are needed. Despite no scene-specificappearance optimization, the pseudo-generalized approach improves upon somescene-specific methods.</description><author>Xiaoming Zhao, Alex Colburn, Fangchang Ma, Miguel Angel Bautista, Joshua M.

The key observation is that while previous grid-basedmethods offer consistent rendering, they fall short in capturing appearancedetails of a complex dynamic scene, a domain where multi-view image-basedrendering methods demonstrate the opposite properties. To combine the best oftwo worlds, we introduce Im4D, a hybrid scene representation that consists of agrid-based geometry representation and a multi-view image-based appearancerepresentation. Specifically, the dynamic geometry is encoded as a 4D densityfunction composed of spatiotemporal feature planes and a small MLP network,which globally models the scene structure and facilitates the renderingconsistency. We represent the scene appearance by the original multi-viewvideos and a network that learns to predict the color of a 3D point from imagefeatures, instead of memorizing detailed appearance totally with networks,thereby naturally making the learning of networks easier. Our method isevaluated on five dynamic view synthesis datasets including DyNeRF, ZJU-MoCap,NHR, DNA-Rendering and ENeRF-Outdoor datasets. The results show that Im4Dexhibits state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality and can be trainedefficiently, while realizing real-time rendering with a speed of 79.8 FPS for512x512 images, on a single RTX 3090 GPU.</description><author>Haotong Lin, Sida Peng, Zhen Xu, Tao Xie, Xingyi He, Hujun Bao, Xiaowei Zhou</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:59:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08585v1</guid></item><item><title>PonderV2: Pave the Way for 3D Foundataion Model with A Universal Pre-training Paradigm</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08586v1</link><description>In contrast to numerous NLP and 2D computer vision foundational models, thelearning of a robust and highly generalized 3D foundational model posesconsiderably greater challenges. This is primarily due to the inherent datavariability and the diversity of downstream tasks. In this paper, we introducea comprehensive 3D pre-training framework designed to facilitate theacquisition of efficient 3D representations, thereby establishing a pathway to3D foundational models. Motivated by the fact that informative 3D featuresshould be able to encode rich geometry and appearance cues that can be utilizedto render realistic images, we propose a novel universal paradigm to learnpoint cloud representations by differentiable neural rendering, serving as abridge between 3D and 2D worlds. We train a point cloud encoder within adevised volumetric neural renderer by comparing the rendered images with thereal images. Notably, our approach demonstrates the seamless integration of thelearned 3D encoder into diverse downstream tasks. These tasks encompass notonly high-level challenges such as 3D detection and segmentation but alsolow-level objectives like 3D reconstruction and image synthesis, spanning bothindoor and outdoor scenarios. Besides, we also illustrate the capability ofpre-training a 2D backbone using the proposed universal methodology, surpassingconventional pre-training methods by a large margin. For the first time,\sexyname achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 indoor and outdoorbenchmarks. The consistent improvements in various settings imply theeffectiveness of the proposed method.

Learning strong image encoders from 1 long unlabelled video</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08584v1</link><description>Self-supervised learning has unlocked the potential of scaling up pretrainingto billions of images, since annotation is unnecessary. But are we making thebest use of data? How more economical can we be? In this work, we attempt toanswer this question by making two contributions. First, we investigatefirst-person videos and introduce a "Walking Tours" dataset. These videos arehigh-resolution, hours-long, captured in a single uninterrupted take, depictinga large number of objects and actions with natural scene transitions. They areunlabeled and uncurated, thus realistic for self-supervision and comparablewith human learning. Second, we introduce a novel self-supervised image pretraining methodtailored for learning from continuous videos. Existing methods typically adaptimage-based pretraining approaches to incorporate more frames. Instead, weadvocate a "tracking to learn to recognize" approach. Our method called DoRA,leads to attention maps that Discover and tRAck objects over time in anend-to-end manner, using transformer cross-attention. We derive multiple viewsfrom the tracks and use them in a classical self-supervised distillation loss.Using our novel approach, a single Walking Tours video remarkably becomes astrong competitor to ImageNet for several image and video downstream tasks.</description><author>Shashanka Venkataramanan, Mamshad Nayeem Rizve, Jo√£o Carreira, Yuki M.

Recently, prompting LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) to generate actions iteratively has become a prevalentparadigm due to its superior performance and user-friendliness. However, thisparadigm is plagued by two inefficiencies: high token consumption and redundanterror correction, both of which hinder its scalability for large-scale testingand applications. To address these issues, we propose Tree-Planner, whichreframes task planning with LLMs into three distinct phases: plan sampling,action tree construction, and grounded deciding. Tree-Planner starts by usingan LLM to sample a set of potential plans before execution, followed by theaggregation of them to form an action tree. Finally, the LLM performs atop-down decision-making process on the tree, taking into account real-timeenvironmental information. Experiments show that Tree-Planner achievesstate-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency. By decomposingLLM queries into a single plan-sampling call and multiple grounded-decidingcalls, a considerable part of the prompt are less likely to be repeatedlyconsumed. As a result, token consumption is reduced by 92.2% compared to thepreviously best-performing model. Additionally, by enabling backtracking on theaction tree as needed, the correction process becomes more flexible, leading toa 40.5% decrease in error corrections.

Learning long-horizon manipulation tasks, however, is along-standing challenge, and demands decomposing the overarching task intoseveral manageable subtasks to facilitate policy learning and generalization tounseen tasks. Prior task decomposition methods require task-specific knowledge,are computationally intensive, and cannot readily be applied to new tasks. Toaddress these shortcomings, we propose Universal Visual Decomposer (UVD), anoff-the-shelf task decomposition method for visual long horizon manipulationusing pre-trained visual representations designed for robotic control. At ahigh level, UVD discovers subgoals by detecting phase shifts in the embeddingspace of the pre-trained representation. Operating purely on visualdemonstrations without auxiliary information, UVD can effectively extractvisual subgoals embedded in the videos, while incurring zero additionaltraining cost on top of standard visuomotor policy training. Goal-conditionedpolicies learned with UVD-discovered subgoals exhibit significantly improvedcompositional generalization at test time to unseen tasks. Furthermore,UVD-discovered subgoals can be used to construct goal-based reward shaping thatjump-starts temporally extended exploration for reinforcement learning. Weextensively evaluate UVD on both simulation and real-world tasks, and in allcases, UVD substantially outperforms baselines across imitation andreinforcement learning settings on in-domain and out-of-domain task sequencesalike, validating the clear advantage of automated visual task decompositionwithin the simple, compact UVD framework.</description><author>Zichen Zhang, Yunshuang Li, Osbert Bastani, Abhishek Gupta, Dinesh Jayaraman, Yecheng Jason Ma, Luca Weihs</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:59:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08581v1</guid></item><item><title>OmniControl: Control Any Joint at Any Time for Human Motion Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08580v1</link><description>We present a novel approach named OmniControl for incorporating flexiblespatial control signals into a text-conditioned human motion generation modelbased on the diffusion process. Unlike previous methods that can only controlthe pelvis trajectory, OmniControl can incorporate flexible spatial controlsignals over different joints at different times with only one model.Specifically, we propose analytic spatial guidance that ensures the generatedmotion can tightly conform to the input control signals. At the same time,realism guidance is introduced to refine all the joints to generate morecoherent motion. Both the spatial and realism guidance are essential and theyare highly complementary for balancing control accuracy and motion realism. Bycombining them, OmniControl generates motions that are realistic, coherent, andconsistent with the spatial constraints. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-MLdatasets show that OmniControl not only achieves significant improvement overstate-of-the-art methods on pelvis control but also shows promising resultswhen incorporating the constraints over other joints.</description><author>Yiming Xie, Varun Jampani, Lei Zhong, Deqing Sun, Huaizu Jiang</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:59:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08580v1</guid></item><item><title>HyperHuman: Hyper-Realistic Human Generation with Latent Structural Diffusion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08579v1</link><description>Despite significant advances in large-scale text-to-image models, achievinghyper-realistic human image generation remains a desirable yet unsolved task.Existing models like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 tend to generate humanimages with incoherent parts or unnatural poses. To tackle these challenges,our key insight is that human image is inherently structural over multiplegranularities, from the coarse-level body skeleton to fine-grained spatialgeometry. Therefore, capturing such correlations between the explicitappearance and latent structure in one model is essential to generate coherentand natural human images. To this end, we propose a unified framework,HyperHuman, that generates in-the-wild human images of high realism and diverselayouts. Specifically, 1) we first build a large-scale human-centric dataset,named HumanVerse, which consists of 340M images with comprehensive annotationslike human pose, depth, and surface normal. 2) Next, we propose a LatentStructural Diffusion Model that simultaneously denoises the depth and surfacenormal along with the synthesized RGB image. Our model enforces the jointlearning of image appearance, spatial relationship, and geometry in a unifiednetwork, where each branch in the model complements to each other with bothstructural awareness and textural richness. 3) Finally, to further boost thevisual quality, we propose a Structure-Guided Refiner to compose the predictedconditions for more detailed generation of higher resolution.

Here, we introducethe novel task of \textit{Visual Data-Type Identification}, a basic perceptualskill with implications for data curation (e.g., noisy data-removal from largedatasets, domain-specific retrieval) and autonomous vision (e.g.,distinguishing changing weather conditions from camera lens staining). Wedevelop two datasets consisting of animal images altered across a diverse setof 27 visual \textit{data-types}, spanning four broad categories. An extensivezero-shot evaluation of 39 VLMs, ranging from 100M to 80B parameters, shows anuanced performance landscape. While VLMs are reasonably good at identifyingcertain stylistic \textit{data-types}, such as cartoons and sketches, theystruggle with simpler \textit{data-types} arising from basic manipulations likeimage rotations or additive noise. Our findings reveal that (i) model scalingalone yields marginal gains for contrastively-trained models like CLIP, and(ii) there is a pronounced drop in performance for the largestauto-regressively trained VLMs like OpenFlamingo. This finding points to ablind spot in current frontier VLMs: they excel in recognizing semantic contentbut fail to acquire an understanding of visual \textit{data-types} throughscaling. By analyzing the pre-training distributions of these models andincorporating \textit{data-type} information into the captions duringfine-tuning, we achieve a significant enhancement in performance. By exploringthis previously uncharted task, we aim to set the stage for further advancingVLMs to equip them with visual data-type understanding.

Our method leverages images as a task-agnostic representation,encoding both the state and action information, and text as a generalrepresentation for specifying robot goals. By synthesizing videos that``hallucinate'' robot executing actions and in combination with densecorrespondences between frames, our approach can infer the closed-formed actionto execute to an environment without the need of any explicit action labels.This unique capability allows us to train the policy solely based on RGB videosand deploy learned policies to various robotic tasks. We demonstrate theefficacy of our approach in learning policies on table-top manipulation andnavigation tasks.

We propose Bucks for Buckets (B4B), the first active defense thatprevents stealing while the attack is happening without degradingrepresentation quality for legitimate API users. Our defense relies on theobservation that the representations returned to adversaries who try to stealthe encoder's functionality cover a significantly larger fraction of theembedding space than representations of legitimate users who utilize theencoder to solve a particular downstream task.vB4B leverages this to adaptivelyadjust the utility of the returned representations according to a user'scoverage of the embedding space. To prevent adaptive adversaries from eludingour defense by simply creating multiple user accounts (sybils), B4B alsoindividually transforms each user's representations. This prevents theadversary from directly aggregating representations over multiple accounts tocreate their stolen encoder copy. Our active defense opens a new path towardssecurely sharing and democratizing encoders over public APIs.</description><author>Jan Dubi≈Ñski, Stanis≈Çaw Pawlak, Franziska Boenisch, Tomasz Trzci≈Ñski, Adam Dziedzic</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:56:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08571v1</guid></item><item><title>A Lightweight Calibrated Simulation Enabling Efficient Offline Learning for Optimal Control of Real Buildings</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08569v1</link><description>Modern commercial Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) devicesform a complex and interconnected thermodynamic system with the building andoutside weather conditions, and current setpoint control policies are not fullyoptimized for minimizing energy use and carbon emission.

This includes two recentlyproposed training methods -- algorithm distillation and decision-pretrainedtransformers. First, assuming model realizability, we prove thesupervised-pretrained transformer will imitate the conditional expectation ofthe expert algorithm given the observed trajectory. The generalization errorwill scale with model capacity and a distribution divergence factor between theexpert and offline algorithms.

Our goal is to provide users, developers and otherstakeholders with a holistic understanding of these areas to enhance theoverall AI-Robotics system security. We begin by surveying potential attacksurfaces and provide mitigating defensive strategies. We then delve intoethical issues, such as dependency and psychological impact, as well as thelegal concerns regarding accountability for these systems.

To enable using context beyond limitedcontext windows, we propose virtual context management, a technique drawinginspiration from hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systemsthat provide the appearance of large memory resources through data movementbetween fast and slow memory. Using this technique, we introduce MemGPT(Memory-GPT), a system that intelligently manages different memory tiers inorder to effectively provide extended context within the LLM's limited contextwindow, and utilizes interrupts to manage control flow between itself and theuser. We evaluate our OS-inspired design in two domains where the limitedcontext windows of modern LLMs severely handicaps their performance: documentanalysis, where MemGPT is able to analyze large documents that far exceed theunderlying LLM's context window, and multi-session chat, where MemGPT cancreate conversational agents that remember, reflect, and evolve dynamicallythrough long-term interactions with their users.

Prior work suggests that language models (LMs)often fall short on inductive reasoning, despite achieving impressive successon research benchmarks. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of theinductive reasoning capabilities of LMs through iterative hypothesisrefinement, a technique that more closely mirrors the human inductive processthan standard input-output prompting. Iterative hypothesis refinement employs athree-step process: proposing, selecting, and refining hypotheses in the formof textual rules. By examining the intermediate rules, we observe that LMs arephenomenal hypothesis proposers (i.e., generating candidate rules), and whencoupled with a (task-specific) symbolic interpreter that is able tosystematically filter the proposed set of rules, this hybrid approach achievesstrong results across inductive reasoning benchmarks that require inducingcausal relations, language-like instructions, and symbolic concepts. However,they also behave as puzzling inductive reasoners, showing notable performancegaps in rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules) and rule application(i.e., applying proposed rules to instances), suggesting that LMs are proposinghypotheses without being able to actually apply the rules. Through empiricaland human analyses, we further reveal several discrepancies between theinductive reasoning processes of LMs and humans, shedding light on both thepotentials and limitations of using LMs in inductive reasoning tasks.</description><author>Linlu Qiu, Liwei Jiang, Ximing Lu, Melanie Sclar, Valentina Pyatkin, Chandra Bhagavatula, Bailin Wang, Yoon Kim, Yejin Choi, Nouha Dziri, Xiang Ren</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:51:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08559v1</guid></item><item><title>StoryBench: A Multifaceted Benchmark for Continuous Story Visualization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11606v2</link><description>Generating video stories from text prompts is a complex task. In addition tohaving high visual quality, videos need to realistically adhere to a sequenceof text prompts whilst being consistent throughout the frames. Creating abenchmark for video generation requires data annotated over time, whichcontrasts with the single caption used often in video datasets. To fill thisgap, we collect comprehensive human annotations on three existing datasets, andintroduce StoryBench: a new, challenging multi-task benchmark to reliablyevaluate forthcoming text-to-video models. Our benchmark includes three videogeneration tasks of increasing difficulty: action execution, where the nextaction must be generated starting from a conditioning video; storycontinuation, where a sequence of actions must be executed starting from aconditioning video; and story generation, where a video must be generated fromonly text prompts. We evaluate small yet strong text-to-video baselines, andshow the benefits of training on story-like data algorithmically generated fromexisting video captions. Finally, we establish guidelines for human evaluationof video stories, and reaffirm the need of better automatic metrics for videogeneration. StoryBench aims at encouraging future research efforts in thisexciting new area.</description><author>Emanuele Bugliarello, Hernan Moraldo, Ruben Villegas, Mohammad Babaeizadeh, Mohammad Taghi Saffar, Han Zhang, Dumitru Erhan, Vittorio Ferrari, Pieter-Jan Kindermans, Paul Voigtlaender</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:50:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11606v2</guid></item><item><title>Tensor Programs VI: Feature Learning in Infinite-Depth Neural Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02244v5</link><description>By classifying infinite-width neural networks and identifying the *optimal*limit, Tensor Programs IV and V demonstrated a universal way, called $\mu$P,for *widthwise hyperparameter transfer*, i.e., predicting optimalhyperparameters of wide neural networks from narrow ones.

We identify *feature diversity* as a crucialfactor in deep networks, and Depth-$\mu$P can be characterized as maximizingboth feature learning and feature diversity. Exploiting this, we find thatabsolute value, among all homogeneous nonlinearities, maximizes featurediversity and indeed empirically leads to significantly better performance.However, if each block is deeper (such as modern transformers), then we findfundamental limitations in all possible infinite-depth limits of suchparametrizations, which we illustrate both theoretically and empirically onsimple networks as well as Megatron transformer trained on Common Crawl.</description><author>Greg Yang, Dingli Yu, Chen Zhu, Soufiane Hayou</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:50:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02244v5</guid></item><item><title>Offline Retraining for Online RL: Decoupled Policy Learning to Mitigate Exploration Bias</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08558v1</link><description>It is desirable for policies to optimistically explore new states andbehaviors during online reinforcement learning (RL) or fine-tuning, especiallywhen prior offline data does not provide enough state coverage. However,exploration bonuses can bias the learned policy, and our experiments find thatnaive, yet standard use of such bonuses can fail to recover a performantpolicy. Concurrently, pessimistic training in offline RL has enabled recoveryof performant policies from static datasets. Can we leverage offline RL torecover better policies from online interaction? We make a simple observationthat a policy can be trained from scratch on all interaction data withpessimistic objectives, thereby decoupling the policies used for datacollection and for evaluation. Specifically, we propose offline retraining, apolicy extraction step at the end of online fine-tuning in ourOffline-to-Online-to-Offline (OOO) framework for reinforcement learning (RL).An optimistic (exploration) policy is used to interact with the environment,and a separate pessimistic (exploitation) policy is trained on all the observeddata for evaluation. Such decoupling can reduce any bias from onlineinteraction (intrinsic rewards, primacy bias) in the evaluation policy, and canallow more exploratory behaviors during online interaction which in turn cangenerate better data for exploitation. OOO is complementary to severaloffline-to-online RL and online RL methods, and improves their averageperformance by 14% to 26% in our fine-tuning experiments, achievesstate-of-the-art performance on several environments in the D4RL benchmarks,and improves online RL performance by 165% on two OpenAI gym environments.Further, OOO can enable fine-tuning from incomplete offline datasets whereprior methods can fail to recover a performant policy.

Although a few seeing-eye robot systems havealready been demonstrated, none considered external tugs from humans, whichfrequently occur in a real guide dog setting. In this paper, we simultaneouslytrain a locomotion controller that is robust to external tugging forces viaReinforcement Learning (RL), and an external force estimator via supervisedlearning. The controller ensures stable walking, and the force estimatorenables the robot to respond to the external forces from the human. Theseforces are used to guide the robot to the global goal, which is unknown to therobot, while the robot guides the human around nearby obstacles via a localplanner. Experimental results in simulation and on hardware show that ourcontroller is robust to external forces, and our seeing-eye system canaccurately detect force direction. We demonstrate our full seeing-eye robotsystem on a real quadruped robot with a blindfolded human.

Central to CEC isthe placement of cross-episodic experiences into a Transformer's context, whichforms the basis of a curriculum. By sequentially structuring online learningtrials and mixed-quality demonstrations, CEC constructs curricula thatencapsulate learning progression and proficiency increase across episodes. Suchsynergy combined with the potent pattern recognition capabilities ofTransformer models delivers a powerful cross-episodic attention mechanism. Theeffectiveness of CEC is demonstrated under two representative scenarios: oneinvolving multi-task reinforcement learning with discrete control, such as inDeepMind Lab, where the curriculum captures the learning progression in bothindividual and progressively complex settings; and the other involvingimitation learning with mixed-quality data for continuous control, as seen inRoboMimic, where the curriculum captures the improvement in demonstrators'expertise. In all instances, policies resulting from CEC exhibit superiorperformance and strong generalization.

In this work, we examine what we can learn from language models'survey responses on the basis of the well-established American Community Survey(ACS) by the U.S. Census Bureau. Using a de-facto standard multiple-choiceprompting technique and evaluating 40 different language models, hundreds ofthousands of times each on questions from the ACS, we systematically establishtwo dominant patterns. First, models have significant position and labelingbiases, for example, towards survey responses labeled with the letter "A".Second, when adjusting for labeling biases through randomized answer ordering,models across the board trend towards uniformly random survey responses. Infact, binary classifiers can almost perfectly differentiate between models'responses to the ACS and the responses of the US census.

However, these works make assumptionsfar from the realistic natural language setting in which language models aretrained. Such discrepancies between theory and practice, therefore, necessitatefurther investigation to validate their applicability. We start by highlighting the weaknesses in prior works that constructTransformer weights to simulate gradient descent. Their experiments withtraining Transformers on ICL objective, inconsistencies in the ordersensitivity of ICL and GD, sparsity of the constructed weights, and sensitivityto parameter changes are some examples of a mismatch from the real-worldsetting. Furthermore, we probe and compare the ICL vs. GD hypothesis in a naturalsetting. We conduct comprehensive empirical analyses on language modelspretrained on natural data (LLaMa-7B). Our comparisons on various performancemetrics highlight the inconsistent behavior of ICL and GD as a function ofvarious factors such as datasets, models, and number of demonstrations. Weobserve that ICL and GD adapt the output distribution of language modelsdifferently.

In recent times, significant progress has beenmade in utilizing deep-learning approaches to automate PCI estimation process.However, the current approaches rely on at least two separate models toestimate PCI values -- one model dedicated to determining the type and extentand another for estimating their severity. This approach presents severalchallenges, including complexities, high computational resource demands, andmaintenance burdens that necessitate careful consideration and resolution. Toovercome these challenges, the current study develops a unified multi-taskingmodel that predicts the PCI directly from a top-down pavement image. Theproposed architecture is a multi-task model composed of one encoder for featureextraction and four decoders to handle specific tasks: two detection heads, onesegmentation head and one PCI estimation head. By multitasking, we are able toextract features from the detection and segmentation heads for automaticallyestimating the PCI directly from the images. The model performs very well onour benchmarked and open pavement distress dataset that is annotated formultitask learning (the first of its kind). To our best knowledge, this is thefirst work that can estimate PCI directly from an image at real time speedswhile maintaining excellent accuracy on all related tasks for crack detectionand segmentation.</description><author>Neema Jakisa Owor, Hang Du, Abdulateef Daud, Armstrong Aboah, Yaw Adu-Gyamfi</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:28:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08538v1</guid></item><item><title>Dynamic Subgoal-based Exploration via Bayesian Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09143v5</link><description>Reinforcement learning in sparse-reward navigation environments withexpensive and limited interactions is challenging and poses a need foreffective exploration.

Visual explanations, as a subset ofExplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), provide intuitive insights into thedecision-making processes of AI models handling visual data by highlightinginfluential areas in an input image. Despite extensive research conducted onvisual explanations, most evaluations are model-centered since the availabilityof corresponding real-world datasets with ground truth explanations is scarcein the context of image data.

PT stands out from other PEFT approaches because itmaintains competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters and does notdrastically scale up its parameters as the model size expands. However, PTintroduces additional soft prompt tokens, leading to longer input sequences,which significantly impacts training and inference time and memory usage due tothe Transformer's quadratic complexity. Particularly concerning for LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) that face heavy daily querying. To address this issue,we propose Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT), which decomposes the soft promptinto a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices that are thenoptimised with two different learning rates. This allows DePT to achieve betterperformance while saving over 20% memory and time costs compared to vanilla PTand its variants, without changing trainable parameter sizes. Through extensiveexperiments on 23 natural language processing (NLP) and vision-language (VL)tasks, we demonstrate that DePT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT approaches,including the full fine-tuning baseline in some scenarios.

Currently, the design and implementation of suchagents is ad hoc, as the wide variety of tasks that LLM-based agents may beapplied to naturally means there can be no one-size-fits-all approach to agentdesign. In this work we aim to alleviate the difficulty of designing andimplementing new agents by proposing a minimalistic, high-level generationframework that simplifies the process of building agents. The framework weintroduce allows the user to specify desired agent behaviors in Linear TemporalLogic (LTL). The declarative LTL specification is then used to construct aconstrained decoder that guarantees the LLM will produce an output exhibitingthe desired behavior. By designing our framework in this way, we obtain severalbenefits, including the ability to enforce complex agent behavior, the abilityto formally validate prompt examples, and the ability to seamlessly incorporatecontent-focused logical constraints into generation. In particular, ourdeclarative approach, in which the desired behavior is simply described withoutconcern for how it should be implemented or enforced, enables rapid design,implementation and experimentation with different LLM-based agents. Wedemonstrate how the proposed framework can be used to implement recentLLM-based agents, and show how the guardrails our approach provides can lead toimprovements in agent performance.

However, these models have long inference latency, which limitstheir deployment and makes them prohibitively expensive for various real-timeapplications. The inference latency is further exacerbated by autoregressivegenerative tasks, as models need to run iteratively to generate tokenssequentially without leveraging token-level parallelization. To address this,we propose Big Little Decoder (BiLD), a framework that can improve inferenceefficiency and latency for a wide range of text generation applications. TheBiLD framework contains two models with different sizes that collaborativelygenerate text. The small model runs autoregressively to generate text with alow inference cost, and the large model is only invoked occasionally to refinethe small model's inaccurate predictions in a non-autoregressive manner. Tocoordinate the small and large models, BiLD introduces two simple yet effectivepolicies: (1) the fallback policy that determines when to hand control over tothe large model; and (2) the rollback policy that determines when the largemodel needs to correct the small model's inaccurate predictions. To evaluateour framework across different tasks and models, we apply BiLD to various textgeneration scenarios encompassing machine translation on IWSLT 2017 De-En andWMT 2014 De-En, and summarization on XSUM and CNN/DailyMail. On an NVIDIA T4GPU, our framework achieves a speedup of up to 2.12x speedup with minimalgeneration quality degradation.

Existing fine-grained promptable tasksmainly focus on object instance detection and segmentation but often fail toidentify fine-grained granularity and structured information of image andinstance, such as eyes, leg, paw, etc. Meanwhile, prompt-based keypointdetection is still under-explored. To bridge the gap, we make the first attemptto develop an end-to-end prompt-based keypoint detection framework calledUniPose to detect keypoints of any objects. As keypoint detection tasks areunified in this framework, we can leverage 13 keypoint detection datasets with338 keypoints across 1,237 categories over 400K instances to train a generickeypoint detection model. UniPose can effectively align text-to-keypoint andimage-to-keypoint due to the mutual enhancement of textual and visual promptsbased on the cross-modality contrastive learning optimization objectives. Ourexperimental results show that UniPose has strong fine-grained localization andgeneralization abilities across image styles, categories, and poses. Based onUniPose as a generalist keypoint detector, we hope it could serve fine-grainedvisual perception, understanding, and generation.</description><author>Jie Yang, Ailing Zeng, Ruimao Zhang, Lei Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:22:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08530v1</guid></item><item><title>GaussianDreamer: Fast Generation from Text to 3D Gaussian Splatting with Point Cloud Priors</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08529v1</link><description>In recent times, the generation of 3D assets from text prompts has shownimpressive results. Both 2D and 3D diffusion models can generate decent 3Dobjects based on prompts. 3D diffusion models have good 3D consistency, buttheir quality and generalization are limited as trainable 3D data is expensiveand hard to obtain. 2D diffusion models enjoy strong abilities ofgeneralization and fine generation, but the 3D consistency is hard toguarantee. This paper attempts to bridge the power from the two types ofdiffusion models via the recent explicit and efficient 3D Gaussian splattingrepresentation. A fast 3D generation framework, named as \name, is proposed,where the 3D diffusion model provides point cloud priors for initialization andthe 2D diffusion model enriches the geometry and appearance. Operations ofnoisy point growing and color perturbation are introduced to enhance theinitialized Gaussians. Our \name can generate a high-quality 3D instance within25 minutes on one GPU, much faster than previous methods, while the generatedinstances can be directly rendered in real time.

Examples include copies of books sold,auction prices of art pieces, demand for commodities in warehouses, etc. Bylearning heavy-tailed distributions, "big and rare" instances (e.g., thebest-sellers) will have accurate predictions. Most existing approaches are notdedicated to learning heavy-tailed distribution; thus, they heavilyunder-predict such instances. To tackle this problem, we introduce Learning toPlace (L2P), which exploits the pairwise relationships between instances forlearning. In its training phase, L2P learns a pairwise preference classifier:is instance A &gt; instance B? In its placing phase, L2P obtains a prediction byplacing the new instance among the known instances. Based on its placement, thenew instance is then assigned a value for its outcome variable. Experiments onreal data show that L2P outperforms competing approaches in terms of accuracyand ability to reproduce heavy-tailed outcome distribution. In addition, L2Pprovides an interpretable model by placing each predicted instance in relationto its comparable neighbors. Interpretable models are highly desirable whenlives and treasure are at stake.</description><author>Xindi Wang, Onur Varol, Tina Eliassi-Rad</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:19:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04628v3</guid></item><item><title>LLM-augmented Preference Learning from Natural Language</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08523v1</link><description>Finding preferences expressed in natural language is an important butchallenging task. State-of-the-art(SotA) methods leverage transformer-basedmodels such as BERT, RoBERTa, etc. and graph neural architectures such as graphattention networks. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) are equipped to dealwith larger context lengths and have much larger model sizes than thetransformer-based model, we investigate their ability to classify comparativetext directly. This work aims to serve as a first step towards using LLMs forthe CPC task. We design and conduct a set of experiments that format theclassification task into an input prompt for the LLM and a methodology to get afixed-format response that can be automatically evaluated. Comparingperformances with existing methods, we see that pre-trained LLMs are able tooutperform the previous SotA models with no fine-tuning involved. Our resultsshow that the LLMs can consistently outperform the SotA when the target text islarge -- i.e. composed of multiple sentences --, and are still comparable tothe SotA performance in shorter text. We also find that few-shot learningyields better performance than zero-shot learning.</description><author>Inwon Kang, Sikai Ruan, Tyler Ho, Jui-Chien Lin, Farhad Mohsin, Oshani Seneviratne, Lirong Xia</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:17:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08523v1</guid></item><item><title>Lion Secretly Solves Constrained Optimization: As Lyapunov Predicts</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05898v2</link><description>Lion (Evolved Sign Momentum), a new optimizer discovered through programsearch, has shown promising results in training large AI models. It performscomparably or favorably to AdamW but with greater memory efficiency. As we canexpect from the results of a random search program, Lion incorporates elementsfrom several existing algorithms, including signed momentum, decoupled weightdecay, Polak, and Nesterov momentum, but does not fit into any existingcategory of theoretically grounded optimizers. Thus, even though Lion appearsto perform well as a general-purpose optimizer for a wide range of tasks, itstheoretical basis remains uncertain. This lack of theoretical clarity limitsopportunities to further enhance and expand Lion's efficacy. This work aims to demystify Lion. Based on both continuous-time anddiscrete-time analysis, we demonstrate that Lion is a theoretically novel andprincipled approach for minimizing a general loss function $f(x)$ whileenforcing a bound constraint $\|x\|_\infty \leq 1/\lambda$. Lion achieves thisthrough the incorporation of decoupled weight decay, where $\lambda$ representsthe weight decay coefficient. Our analysis is made possible by the developmentof a new Lyapunov function for the Lion updates. It applies to a broader familyof Lion-$\kappa$ algorithms, where the $\text{sign}(\cdot)$ operator in Lion isreplaced by the subgradient of a convex function $\kappa$, leading to thesolution of a general composite optimization problem of $\min_x f(x) +\kappa^*(x)$. Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Lionand pave the way for further improvements and extensions of Lion-relatedalgorithms.</description><author>Lizhang Chen, Bo Liu, Kaizhao Liang, Qiang Liu</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:16:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05898v2</guid></item><item><title>How connectivity structure shapes rich and lazy learning in neural circuits</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08513v1</link><description>In theoretical neuroscience, recent work leverages deep learning tools toexplore how some network attributes critically influence its learning dynamics.Notably, initial weight distributions with small (resp. large) variance mayyield a rich (resp. lazy) regime, where significant (resp. minor) changes tonetwork states and representation are observed over the course of learning.However, in biology, neural circuit connectivity generally has a low-rankstructure and therefore differs markedly from the random initializationsgenerally used for these studies. As such, here we investigate how thestructure of the initial weights, in particular their effective rank,influences the network learning regime. Through both empirical and theoreticalanalyses, we discover that high-rank initializations typically yield smallernetwork changes indicative of lazier learning, a finding we also confirm withexperimentally-driven initial connectivity in recurrent neural networks.Conversely, low-rank initialization biases learning towards richer learning.Importantly, however, as an exception to this rule, we find lazier learning canstill occur with a low-rank initialization that aligns with task and datastatistics. Our research highlights the pivotal role of initial weightstructures in shaping learning regimes, with implications for metabolic costsof plasticity and risks of catastrophic forgetting.</description><author>Yuhan Helena Liu, Aristide Baratin, Jonathan Cornford, Stefan Mihalas, Eric Shea-Brown, Guillaume Lajoie</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:08:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08513v1</guid></item><item><title>mGPT: Few-Shot Learners Go Multilingual</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07580v2</link><description>Recent studies report that autoregressive language models can successfullysolve many NLP tasks via zero- and few-shot learning paradigms, which opens upnew possibilities for using the pre-trained language models.

Most multimodal learning algorithms focus on modelingsimple one-to-one pairs of data from two modalities, such as image-captionpairs, or audio-text pairs. However, in most real-world settings, entities ofdifferent modalities interact with each other in more complex and multifacetedways, going beyond one-to-one mappings. We propose to represent these complexrelationships as graphs, allowing us to capture data with any number ofmodalities, and with complex relationships between modalities that can flexiblyvary from one sample to another. Toward this goal, we propose Multimodal GraphLearning (MMGL), a general and systematic framework for capturing informationfrom multiple multimodal neighbors with relational structures among them. Inparticular, we focus on MMGL for generative tasks, building upon pretrainedLanguage Models (LMs), aiming to augment their text generation with multimodalneighbor contexts. We study three research questions raised by MMGL: (1) howcan we infuse multiple neighbor information into the pretrained LMs, whileavoiding scalability issues? (2) how can we infuse the graph structureinformation among multimodal neighbors into the LMs? and (3) how can wefinetune the pretrained LMs to learn from the neighbor context in aparameter-efficient manner? We conduct extensive experiments to answer thesethree questions on MMGL and analyze the empirical results to pave the way forfuture MMGL research.</description><author>Minji Yoon, Jing Yu Koh, Bryan Hooi, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:07:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07478v2</guid></item><item><title>HoneyBee: Progressive Instruction Finetuning of Large Language Models for Materials Science</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08511v1</link><description>We propose an instruction-based process for trustworthy data curation inmaterials science (MatSci-Instruct), which we then apply to finetune aLLaMa-based language model targeted for materials science (HoneyBee).MatSci-Instruct helps alleviate the scarcity of relevant, high-qualitymaterials science textual data available in the open literature, and HoneyBeeis the first billion-parameter language model specialized to materials science.In MatSci-Instruct we improve the trustworthiness of generated data byprompting multiple commercially available large language models for generationwith an Instructor module (e.g. Chat-GPT) and verification from an independentVerifier module (e.g. Claude).

For some tasks, LLMs achieve similar or better performance thantrained human beings, therefore it is reasonable to employ human exams (e.g.,certification tests) to assess the performance of LLMs. We present acomprehensive evaluation of popular LLMs, such as Llama 2 and GPT, on theirability to answer agriculture-related questions. In our evaluation, we alsoemploy RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and ER (Ensemble Refinement)techniques, which combine information retrieval, generation capabilities, andprompting strategies to improve the LLMs' performance. To demonstrate thecapabilities of LLMs, we selected agriculture exams and benchmark datasets fromthree of the largest agriculture producer countries: Brazil, India, and theUSA. Our analysis highlights GPT-4's ability to achieve a passing score onexams to earn credits for renewing agronomist certifications, answering 93% ofthe questions correctly and outperforming earlier general-purpose models, whichachieved 88% accuracy. On one of our experiments, GPT-4 obtained the highestperformance when compared to human subjects. This performance suggests thatGPT-4 could potentially pass on major graduate education admission tests oreven earn credits for renewing agronomy certificates. We also explore themodels' capacity to address general agriculture-related questions and generatecrop management guidelines for Brazilian and Indian farmers, utilizing robustdatasets from the Brazilian Agency of Agriculture (Embrapa) and graduateprogram exams from India.

For each data point, abductive explanations provide aminimal subset of features that are sufficient to generate the outcome. Whiletheoretically sound and rigorous, abductive explanations suffer from a majorissue -- there can be several valid abductive explanations for the same datapoint. In such cases, providing a single abductive explanation can beinsufficient; on the other hand, providing all valid abductive explanations canbe incomprehensible due to their size. In this work, we solve this issue byaggregating the many possible abductive explanations into feature importancescores. We propose three aggregation methods: two based on power indices fromcooperative game theory and a third based on a well-known measure of causalstrength. We characterize these three methods axiomatically, showing that eachof them uniquely satisfies a set of desirable properties.

We introduce object-centric embeddings (OCEs), which embed imagepatches such that the spatial offsets between patches cropped from the sameobject are preserved.

Here, we showtheoretically that, under assumptions commonly found in microscopy images, OCEscan be learnt through a self-supervised task that predicts the spatial offsetbetween image patches. Together, this forms an unsupervised cell instancesegmentation method which we evaluate on nine diverse large-scale microscopydatasets. Segmentations obtained with our method lead to substantially improvedresults, compared to state-of-the-art baselines on six out of nine datasets,and perform on par on the remaining three datasets. If ground-truth annotationsare available, our method serves as an excellent starting point for supervisedtraining, reducing the required amount of ground-truth needed by one order ofmagnitude, thus substantially increasing the practical applicability of ourmethod.

Climate intervention methods, such asstratospheric aerosol injection, have been proposed as mitigation strategies,but the downstream effects of such actions on a complex climate system are notwell understood. The development of algorithmic techniques for quantifyingrelationships between source and impact variables related to a climate event(i.e., a climate pathway) would help inform policy decisions. Data-driven deeplearning models have become powerful tools for modeling highly nonlinearrelationships and may provide a route to characterize climate variablerelationships. In this paper, we explore the use of an echo state network (ESN)for characterizing climate pathways. ESNs are a computationally efficientneural network variation designed for temporal data, and recent work proposesESNs as a useful tool for forecasting spatio-temporal climate data. Like otherneural networks, ESNs are non-interpretable black-box models, which poses ahurdle for understanding variable relationships. We address this issue bydeveloping feature importance methods for ESNs in the context ofspatio-temporal data to quantify variable relationships captured by the model.We conduct a simulation study to assess and compare the feature importancetechniques, and we demonstrate the approach on reanalysis climate data. In theclimate application, we select a time period that includes the 1991 volcaniceruption of Mount Pinatubo. This event was a significant stratospheric aerosolinjection, which we use as a proxy for an artificial stratospheric aerosolinjection.

However, for practitioners with large-scale evaluation tasks andcustom criteria in consideration (e.g., child-readability), using proprietaryLLMs as an evaluator is unreliable due to the closed-source nature,uncontrolled versioning, and prohibitive costs. In this work, we proposePrometheus, a fully open-source LLM that is on par with GPT-4's evaluationcapabilities when the appropriate reference materials (reference answer, scorerubric) are accompanied. We first construct the Feedback Collection, a newdataset that consists of 1K fine-grained score rubrics, 20K instructions, and100K responses and language feedback generated by GPT-4. Using the FeedbackCollection, we train Prometheus, a 13B evaluator LLM that can assess any givenlong-form text based on customized score rubric provided by the user.Experimental results show that Prometheus scores a Pearson correlation of 0.897with human evaluators when evaluating with 45 customized score rubrics, whichis on par with GPT-4 (0.882), and greatly outperforms ChatGPT (0.392).Furthermore, measuring correlation with GPT-4 with 1222 customized scorerubrics across four benchmarks (MT Bench, Vicuna Bench, Feedback Bench, FlaskEval) shows similar trends, bolstering Prometheus's capability as an evaluatorLLM. Lastly, Prometheus achieves the highest accuracy on two human preferencebenchmarks (HHH Alignment &amp; MT Bench Human Judgment) compared to open-sourcedreward models explicitly trained on human preference datasets, highlighting itspotential as an universal reward model.

Over a wide variety ofapplications and models it was observed that learning curves follow -- to alarge extent -- a power law behavior. This makes the performance of differentmodels for a given task somewhat predictable and opens the opportunity toreduce the training time for practitioners, who are exploring the space ofpossible models and hyperparameters for the problem at hand. By estimating thelearning curve of a model from training on small subsets of data only the bestmodels need to be considered for training on the full dataset. How to choosesubset sizes and how often to sample models on these to obtain estimates ishowever not researched. Given that the goal is to reduce overall training timestrategies are needed that sample the performance in a time-efficient way andyet leads to accurate learning curve estimates. In this paper we formulate theframework for these strategies and propose several strategies. Further weevaluate the strategies for simulated learning curves and in experiments withpopular datasets and models for image classification tasks.</description><author>Laura Didyk, Brayden Yarish, Michael A.

Given a set of video clips of thesame motion concept, the task of Motion Customization is to adapt existingtext-to-video diffusion models to generate videos with this motion. Forexample, generating a video with a car moving in a prescribed manner underspecific camera movements to make a movie, or a video illustrating how a bearwould lift weights to inspire creators. Adaptation methods have been developedfor customizing appearance like subject or style, yet unexplored for motion. Itis straightforward to extend mainstream adaption methods for motioncustomization, including full model tuning, parameter-efficient tuning ofadditional layers, and Low-Rank Adaptions (LoRAs). However, the motion conceptlearned by these methods is often coupled with the limited appearances in thetraining videos, making it difficult to generalize the customized motion toother appearances. To overcome this challenge, we propose MotionDirector, witha dual-path LoRAs architecture to decouple the learning of appearance andmotion. Further, we design a novel appearance-debiased temporal loss tomitigate the influence of appearance on the temporal training objective.Experimental results show the proposed method can generate videos of diverseappearances for the customized motions. Our method also supports variousdownstream applications, such as the mixing of different videos with theirappearance and motion respectively, and animating a single image withcustomized motions.

However, identifying acompact draft model that is well-aligned with the target model is challenging.To tackle this issue, we propose DistillSpec that uses knowledge distillationto better align the draft model with the target model, before applying SD.DistillSpec makes two key design choices, which we demonstrate via systematicstudy to be crucial to improving the draft and target alignment: utilizingon-policy data generation from the draft model, and tailoring the divergencefunction to the task and decoding strategy. Notably, DistillSpec yieldsimpressive 10 - 45% speedups over standard SD on a range of standardbenchmarks, using both greedy and non-greedy sampling. Furthermore, we combineDistillSpec with lossy SD to achieve fine-grained control over the latency vs.task performance trade-off. Finally, in practical scenarios with models ofvarying sizes, first using distillation to boost the performance of the targetmodel and then applying DistillSpec to train a well-aligned draft model canreduce decoding latency by 6-10x with minimal performance drop, compared tostandard decoding without distillation.</description><author>Yongchao Zhou, Kaifeng Lyu, Ankit Singh Rawat, Aditya Krishna Menon, Afshin Rostamizadeh, Sanjiv Kumar, Jean-Fran√ßois Kagy, Rishabh Agarwal</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 17:21:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08461v1</guid></item><item><title>A Survey on Heterogeneous Transfer Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08459v1</link><description>The application of transfer learning, an approach utilizing knowledge from asource domain to enhance model performance in a target domain, has seen atremendous rise in recent years, underpinning many real-world scenarios. Thekey to its success lies in the shared common knowledge between the domains, aprerequisite in most transfer learning methodologies. These methods typicallypresuppose identical feature spaces and label spaces in both domains, known ashomogeneous transfer learning, which, however, is not always a practicalassumption. Oftentimes, the source and target domains vary in feature spaces,data distributions, and label spaces, making it challenging or costly to securesource domain data with identical feature and label spaces as the targetdomain. Arbitrary elimination of these differences is not always feasible oroptimal. Thus, heterogeneous transfer learning, acknowledging and dealing withsuch disparities, has emerged as a promising approach for a variety of tasks.Despite the existence of a survey in 2017 on this topic, the fast-pacedadvances post-2017 necessitate an updated, in-depth review. We thereforepresent a comprehensive survey of recent developments in heterogeneous transferlearning methods, offering a systematic guide for future research.

Prior work largely focuses on determiningwhether a RecSys is discriminating or not but does not compute the amount ofbias present in these systems. Biased recommendations may lead to decisionsthat can potentially have adverse effects on individuals, sensitive usergroups, and society. Hence, it is important to quantify these biases for fairand safe commercial applications of these systems. This paper focuses onquantifying popularity bias that stems directly from the output of RecSysmodels, leading to over recommendation of popular items that are likely to bemisaligned with user preferences. Four metrics to quantify popularity bias inRescSys over time in dynamic setting across different sensitive user groupshave been proposed. These metrics have been demonstrated for four collaborativefiltering based RecSys algorithms trained on two commonly used benchmarkdatasets in the literature. Results obtained show that the metrics proposedprovide a comprehensive understanding of growing disparities in treatmentbetween sensitive groups over time when used conjointly.</description><author>Valentijn Braun, Debarati Bhaumik, Diptish Dey</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 17:15:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08455v1</guid></item><item><title>On the Security Vulnerabilities of Text-to-SQL Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15363v3</link><description>Although it has been demonstrated that Natural Language Processing (NLP)algorithms are vulnerable to deliberate attacks, the question of whether suchweaknesses can lead to software security threats is under-explored.

The analysis and monitoring of theprocesses is necessary for efficient production design. Traditional methods foranalyzing manual processes are complex, expensive, and inflexible. Compared toestablished approaches such as Methods-Time-Measurement (MTM), machine learning(ML) methods promise: Higher flexibility, self-sufficient &amp; permanent use,lower costs. In this work, based on a video stream, the current motion class ina manual assembly process is detected. With information on the current motion,Key-Performance-Indicators (KPIs) can be derived easily. A skeleton-basedaction recognition approach is taken, as this field recently shows majorsuccess in machine vision tasks. For skeleton-based action recognition inmanual assembly, no sufficient pre-work could be found. Therefore, a MLpipeline is developed, to enable extensive research on different (pre-)processing methods and neural nets. Suitable well generalizing approaches arefound, proving the potential of ML to enhance analyzation of manual processes.Models detect the current motion, performed by an operator in manual assembly,but the results can be transferred to all kinds of manual processes.</description><author>Marlin Berger, Frederik Cloppenburg, Jens Eufinger, Thomas Gries</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 17:11:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08451v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning to Generate Novel Scientific Directions with Contextualized Literature-based Discovery</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14259v3</link><description>Literature-Based Discovery (LBD) aims to discover new scientific knowledge bymining papers and generating hypotheses.

LLM serves as the "brain" of agent, orchestrating multipletools for collaborative multi-step task solving. Unlike methods invoking toolslike calculators or weather APIs for straightforward tasks, multi-modal agentsexcel by integrating diverse AI models for complex challenges. However, currentmulti-modal agents neglect the significance of model selection: they primarilyfocus on the planning and execution phases, and will only invoke predefinedtask-specific models for each subtask, making the execution fragile. Meanwhile,other traditional model selection methods are either incompatible with orsuboptimal for the multi-modal agent scenarios, due to ignorance ofdependencies among subtasks arising by multi-step reasoning. To this end, we identify the key challenges therein and propose the$\textit{M}^3$ framework as a plug-in with negligible runtime overhead attest-time. This framework improves model selection and bolsters the robustnessof multi-modal agents in multi-step reasoning. In the absence of suitablebenchmarks, we create MS-GQA, a new dataset specifically designed toinvestigate the model selection challenge in multi-modal agents.

The sampling-based perspective posits that thebrain infers the posterior distribution through samples of stochastic neuronalresponses. Additionally, the brain continually updates its generative model toapproach the true distribution of the external world. In this study, weintroduce the Hierarchical Exponential-family Energy-based (HEE) model, whichcaptures the dynamics of inference and learning. In the HEE model, we decomposethe partition function into individual layers and leverage a group of neuronswith shorter time constants to sample the gradient of the decomposednormalization term. This allows our model to estimate the partition functionand perform inference simultaneously, circumventing the negative phaseencountered in conventional energy-based models (EBMs). As a result, thelearning process is localized both in time and space, and the model is easy toconverge. To match the brain's rapid computation, we demonstrate that neuraladaptation can serve as a momentum term, significantly accelerating theinference process. On natural image datasets, our model exhibitsrepresentations akin to those observed in the biological visual system.Furthermore, for the machine learning community, our model can generateobservations through joint or marginal generation. We show that marginalgeneration outperforms joint generation and achieves performance on par withother EBMs.</description><author>Xingsi Dong, Si Wu</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 16:56:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08431v1</guid></item><item><title>QKSAN: A Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13422v2</link><description>Self-Attention Mechanism (SAM) excels at distilling important informationfrom the interior of data to improve the computational efficiency of models.Nevertheless, many Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models lack the ability todistinguish the intrinsic connections of information like SAM, which limitstheir effectiveness on massive high-dimensional quantum data. To tackle theabove issue, a Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Mechanism (QKSAM) is introduced tocombine the data representation merit of Quantum Kernel Methods (QKM) with theefficient information extraction capability of SAM. Further, a Quantum KernelSelf-Attention Network (QKSAN) framework is proposed based on QKSAM, whichingeniously incorporates the Deferred Measurement Principle (DMP) andconditional measurement techniques to release half of quantum resources bymid-circuit measurement, thereby bolstering both feasibility and adaptability.Simultaneously, the Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Score (QKSAS) with anexponentially large characterization space is spawned to accommodate moreinformation and determine the measurement conditions. Eventually, four QKSANsub-models are deployed on PennyLane and IBM Qiskit platforms to perform binaryclassification on MNIST and Fashion MNIST, where the QKSAS tests andcorrelation assessments between noise immunity and learning ability areexecuted on the best-performing sub-model. The paramount experimental findingis that a potential learning advantage is revealed in partial QKSAN subclassesthat acquire an impressive more than 98.05% high accuracy with very fewparameters that are much less in aggregate than classical machine learningmodels.

Here we propose extensions to HIPthat accommodate multi-class, Poisson, and Zero-Inflated Poisson outcomes whileretaining the benefits of HIP. Additionally, we introduce an R Shinyapplication, accessible on shinyapps.io athttps://multi-viewlearn.shinyapps.io/HIP_ShinyApp/, that provides an interfacewith the Python implementation of HIP to allow more researchers to use themethod anywhere and on any device. We applied HIP to identify genes andproteins common and specific to males and females that are associated withexacerbation frequency. Although some of the identified genes and proteins showevidence of a relationship with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) inexisting literature, others may be candidates for future research investigatingtheir relationship with COPD. We demonstrate the use of the Shiny applicationwith a publicly available data. An R-package for HIP would be made available athttps://github.com/lasandrall/HIP.</description><author>J. Butts, C.

Understanding why this happens is theoretically and practicallyimportant. One recent approach looks at the infinitely wide limits of suchnetworks and their corresponding kernels. However, these theoretical toolscannot fully explain finite networks as the empirical kernel changessignificantly during gradient-descent-based training in contrast to infinitenetworks. In this work, we derive an iterative linearised training method as anovel empirical tool to further investigate this distinction, allowing us tocontrol for sparse (i.e. infrequent) feature updates and quantify the frequencyof feature learning needed to achieve comparable performance. We justifyiterative linearisation as an interpolation between a finite analog of theinfinite width regime, which does not learn features, and standard gradientdescent training, which does. Informally, we also show that it is analogous toa damped version of the Gauss-Newton algorithm -- a second-order method. Weshow that in a variety of cases, iterative linearised training surprisinglyperforms on par with standard training, noting in particular how much lessfrequent feature learning is required to achieve comparable performance. Wealso show that feature learning is essential for good performance. Since suchfeature learning inevitably causes changes in the NTK kernel, we provide directnegative evidence for the NTK theory, which states the NTK kernel remainsconstant during training.</description><author>Adrian Goldwaser, Hong Ge</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 16:44:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12345v4</guid></item><item><title>On Scale Space Radon Transform, Properties and Application in CT Image Reconstruction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05188v3</link><description>Since the Radon transform (RT) consists in a line integral function, somemodeling assumptions are made on Computed Tomography (CT) system, making imagereconstruction analytical methods, such as Filtered Backprojection (FBP),sensitive to artifacts and noise. In the other hand, recently, a new integraltransform, called Scale Space Radon Transform (SSRT), is introduced where, RTis a particular case. Thanks to its interesting properties, such as good scalespace behavior, the SSRT has known number of new applications. In this paper,with the aim to improve the reconstructed image quality for these methods, wepropose to model the X-ray beam with the Scale Space Radon Transform (SSRT)where, the assumptions done on the physical dimensions of the CT systemelements reflect better the reality. After depicting the basic properties andthe inversion of SSRT, the FBP algorithm is used to reconstruct the image fromthe SSRT sinogram where the RT spectrum used in FBP is replaced by SSRT and theGaussian kernel, expressed in their frequency domain. PSNR and SSIM, as qualitymeasures, are used to compare RT and SSRT-based image reconstruction onShepp-Logan head and anthropomorphic abdominal phantoms. The first findingsshow that the SSRT-based method outperforms the methods based on RT,especially, when the number of projections is reduced, making it moreappropriate for applications requiring low-dose radiation, such as medicalX-ray CT.

Recently, integration of contrastivelearning on top of existing SSL models has established considerable progress incomputer vision through which visual SSL models have outperformed theirsupervised counterparts. Nevertheless, most of these improvements were limitedto classification tasks, and also, few works have been dedicated to evaluationof SSL models in real-world scenarios of computer vision, while the majority ofworks are centered around datasets containing class-wise portrait images, mostnotably, ImageNet. Consequently, in this work, we have considered denseprediction task of semantic segmentation in security inspection x-ray images toevaluate our proposed model Segmentation Localization. Based upon the modelInstance Localization, our model SegLoc has managed to address one of the mostchallenging downsides of contrastive learning, i.e., false negative pairs ofquery embeddings. In order to do so, in contrast to baseline model InsLoc, ourpretraining dataset is synthesized by cropping, transforming, then pastingalready labeled segments from an available labeled dataset, foregrounds, ontoinstances of an unlabeled dataset, backgrounds. In our case, PIDray and SIXraydatasets are considered as labeled and unlabeled datasets, respectively.Moreover, we fully harness labels by avoiding false negative pairs throughimplementing the idea, one queue per class, in MoCo-v2 whereby negative pairscorresponding to each query are extracted from its corresponding queue withinthe memory bank.

While attention-guided learning has shown promising results, it ofteninvolves time-consuming and computationally expensive model retraining. Toaddress this issue, we introduce the attention-prompted prediction technique,which enables direct prediction guided by the attention prompt without the needfor model retraining. However, this approach presents several challenges,including: 1) How to incorporate the visual attention prompt into the model'sdecision-making process and leverage it for future predictions even in theabsence of a prompt? and 2) How to handle the incomplete information from thevisual attention prompt? To tackle these challenges, we propose a novelframework called Visual Attention-Prompted Prediction and Learning, whichseamlessly integrates visual attention prompts into the model's decision-makingprocess and adapts to images both with and without attention prompts forprediction. To address the incomplete information of the visual attentionprompt, we introduce a perturbation-based attention map modification method.Additionally, we propose an optimization-based mask aggregation method with anew weight learning function for adaptive perturbed annotation aggregation inthe attention map modification process. Our overall framework is designed tolearn in an attention-prompt guided multi-task manner to enhance futurepredictions even for samples without attention prompts and trained in analternating manner for better convergence.

However, the alignment of such models is vulnerable toadversarial jailbreaks, which coax LLMs into overriding their safetyguardrails. The identification of these vulnerabilities is thereforeinstrumental in understanding inherent weaknesses and preventing future misuse.To this end, we propose Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR), analgorithm that generates semantic jailbreaks with only black-box access to anLLM. PAIR -- which is inspired by social engineering attacks -- uses anattacker LLM to automatically generate jailbreaks for a separate targeted LLMwithout human intervention. In this way, the attacker LLM iteratively queriesthe target LLM to update and refine a candidate jailbreak. Empirically, PAIRoften requires fewer than twenty queries to produce a jailbreak, which isorders of magnitude more efficient than existing algorithms.

A conventional approach is traininga model with the unlabeled graphs on self-supervised tasks and then fine-tuningthe model on the prediction tasks. However, the self-supervised task knowledgecould not be aligned or sometimes conflicted with what the predictions needed.In this paper, we propose to extract the knowledge underlying the large set ofunlabeled graphs as a specific set of useful data points to augment eachproperty prediction model.

Nevertheless, their point identificationis challenging, requiring strong assumptions, in the absence of which onlybounds can be derived. Existing work to further tighten these bounds byleveraging extra information either provides numerical bounds, symbolic boundsfor fixed dimensionality, or requires access to multiple datasets that containthe same treatment and outcome variables. However, in many clinical,epidemiological and public policy applications, there exist external datasetsthat examine the effect of different treatments on the same outcome variable,or study the association between covariates and the outcome variable. Theseexternal datasets cannot be used in conjunction with the aforementioned bounds,since the former may entail different treatment assignment mechanisms, or evenobey different causal structures. Here, we provide symbolic bounds on the PoCfor this challenging scenario. We focus on combining either two randomizedexperiments studying different treatments, or a randomized experiment and anobservational study, assuming causal sufficiency. Our symbolic bounds work forarbitrary dimensionality of covariates and treatment, and we discuss theconditions under which these bounds are tighter than existing bounds inliterature. Finally, our bounds parameterize the difference in treatmentassignment mechanism across datasets, allowing the mechanisms to vary acrossdatasets while still allowing causal information to be transferred from theexternal dataset to the target dataset.</description><author>Numair Sani, Atalanti A.

The core of the proposed sensor is theutilization of miniature 1.5 mm x 1.5 mm synthetic square markers with innerbinary patterns and a broad black border, called ArUco Markers. Each ArUcomarker can provide real-time camera pose estimation that, in our design, isused as a quantitative measure for obtaining deformation of the QS-TS gellayer. Moreover, thanks to the use of ArUco markers, we propose a uniquefabrication procedure that mitigates various challenges associated with thefabrication of the existing marker-based VTSs and offers an intuitive andless-arduous method for the construction of the VTS. Remarkably, the proposedfabrication facilitates the integration and adherence of markers with the gellayer to robustly and reliably obtain a quantitative measure of deformation inreal-time regardless of the orientation of ArUco Markers.

These can address different main tasks (i.e., in thesetting of Multi-Task Learning), but also main and secondary tasks such as lossminimization versus sparsity. The usual approach is a simple weighting of thecriteria, which formally only works in the convex setting. In this paper, wepresent a Multi-Objective Optimization algorithm using a modified WeightedChebyshev scalarization for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with respectto several tasks. By employing this scalarization technique, the algorithm canidentify all optimal solutions of the original problem while reducing itscomplexity to a sequence of single-objective problems. The simplified problemsare then solved using an Augmented Lagrangian method, enabling the use ofpopular optimization techniques such as Adam and Stochastic Gradient Descent,while efficaciously handling constraints. Our work aims to address the(economical and also ecological) sustainability issue of DNN models, with aparticular focus on Deep Multi-Task models, which are typically designed with avery large number of weights to perform equally well on multiple tasks. Throughexperiments conducted on two Machine Learning datasets, we demonstrate thepossibility of adaptively sparsifying the model during training withoutsignificantly impacting its performance, if we are willing to applytask-specific adaptations to the network weights.

The typical approach involves training an image classificationnetwork using global average pooling (GAP) on convolutional feature maps. Thisenables the estimation of object locations based on class activation maps(CAMs), which identify the importance of image regions. The CAMs are then usedto generate pseudo-labels, in the form of segmentation masks, to supervise asegmentation model in the absence of pixel-level ground truth. Our work isbased on two techniques for improving CAMs; importance sampling, which is asubstitute for GAP, and the feature similarity loss, which utilizes a heuristicthat object contours almost always align with color edges in images. However,both are based on the multinomial posterior with softmax, and implicitly assumethat classes are mutually exclusive, which turns out suboptimal in ourexperiments. Thus, we reformulate both techniques based on binomial posteriorsof multiple independent binary problems. This has two benefits; theirperformance is improved and they become more general, resulting in an add-onmethod that can boost virtually any WSSS method. This is demonstrated on a widevariety of baselines on the PASCAL VOC dataset, improving the region similarityand contour quality of all implemented state-of-the-art methods.

These theoretical findings complement prior experimental research andshed light on the statistical foundations of ICL.</description><author>Jingfeng Wu, Difan Zou, Zixiang Chen, Vladimir Braverman, Quanquan Gu, Peter L.

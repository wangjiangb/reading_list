We use the power of off-the-shelfVisual-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), and developvisual and text prompting strategies for this task. Our contributions arethree-fold: (i) We demonstrate that a VLM can successfully name and refer tocharacters if directly prompted with character information through visualindications without requiring any fine-tuning; (ii) A two-stage process isdeveloped to generate ADs, with the first stage asking the VLM tocomprehensively describe the video, followed by a second stage utilising a LLMto summarise dense textual information into one succinct AD sentence; (iii) Anew dataset for TV audio description is formulated. Our approach, namedAutoAD-Zero, demonstrates outstanding performance (even competitive with somemodels fine-tuned on ground truth ADs) in AD generation for both movies and TVseries, achieving state-of-the-art CRITIC scores.</description><author>Junyu Xie, Tengda Han, Max Bain, Arsha Nagrani, GÃ¼l Varol, Weidi Xie, Andrew Zisserman</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 17:59:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15850v1</guid></item><item><title>WayEx: Waypoint Exploration using a Single Demonstration</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15849v1</link><description>We propose WayEx, a new method for learning complex goal-conditioned roboticstasks from a single demonstration. Our approach distinguishes itself fromexisting imitation learning methods by demanding fewer expert examples andeliminating the need for information about the actions taken during thedemonstration. This is accomplished by introducing a new reward function andemploying a knowledge expansion technique. We demonstrate the effectiveness ofWayEx, our waypoint exploration strategy, across six diverse tasks, showcasingits applicability in various environments. Notably, our method significantlyreduces training time by 50% as compared to traditional reinforcement learningmethods. WayEx obtains a higher reward than existing imitation learning methodsgiven only a single demonstration. Furthermore, we demonstrate its success intackling complex environments where standard approaches fall short.

Generalizable andMVS-based NeRFs, although capable of mitigating training time, often incurtradeoffs in quality. This paper presents a novel approach called BoostMVSNeRFsto enhance the rendering quality of MVS-based NeRFs in large-scale scenes. Wefirst identify limitations in MVS-based NeRF methods, such as restrictedviewport coverage and artifacts due to limited input views. Then, we addressthese limitations by proposing a new method that selects and combines multiplecost volumes during volume rendering. Our method does not require training andcan adapt to any MVS-based NeRF methods in a feed-forward fashion to improverendering quality. Furthermore, our approach is also end-to-end trainable,allowing fine-tuning on specific scenes. We demonstrate the effectiveness ofour method through experiments on large-scale datasets, showing significantrendering quality improvements in large-scale scenes and unbounded outdoorscenarios.

LLMmap employs an active fingerprinting approach,sending carefully crafted queries to the application and analyzing theresponses to identify the specific LLM model in use. With as few as 8interactions, LLMmap can accurately identify LLMs with over 95% accuracy.

Establishing tissue-level morphology criticallyrelies on how every single cell decides to position itself relative to itsneighboring cells. Despite its importance, it remains a major challenge tounderstand and predict the behavior of every cell within the living tissue overtime during such intricate processes. To tackle this question, we propose ageometric deep learning model that can predict multicellular folding andembryogenesis, accurately capturing the highly convoluted spatial interactionsamong cells. We demonstrate that multicellular data can be represented withboth granular and foam-like physical pictures through a unified graph datastructure, considering both cellular interactions and cell junction networks.We successfully use our model to achieve two important tasks, interpretable 4-Dmorphological sequence alignment, and predicting local cell rearrangementsbefore they occur at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, using an activationmap and ablation studies, we demonstrate that cell geometries and cell junctionnetworks together regulate local cell rearrangement which is critical forembryo morphogenesis. This approach provides a novel paradigm to studymorphogenesis, highlighting a unified data structure and harnessing the powerof geometric deep learning to accurately model the mechanisms and behaviors ofcells during development. It offers a pathway toward creating a unified dynamicmorphological atlas for a variety of developmental processes such asembryogenesis.</description><author>Haiqian Yang, Anh Q.

Such restrictions hinder their applicability to real-world scenarios.In this paper, we present a novel approach enabling data reconstruction inrealistic settings for models trained on high-resolution images. Our methodadapts the reconstruction scheme of arXiv:2206.07758 to real-world scenarios --specifically, targeting models trained via transfer learning over imageembeddings of large pre-trained models like DINO-ViT and CLIP. Our work employsdata reconstruction in the embedding space rather than in the image space,showcasing its applicability beyond visual data. Moreover, we introduce a novelclustering-based method to identify good reconstructions from thousands ofcandidates. This significantly improves on previous works that relied onknowledge of the training set to identify good reconstructed images. Ourfindings shed light on a potential privacy risk for data leakage from modelstrained using transfer learning.</description><author>Yakir Oz, Gilad Yehudai, Gal Vardi, Itai Antebi, Michal Irani, Niv Haim</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 17:59:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15845v1</guid></item><item><title>HandDGP: Camera-Space Hand Mesh Prediction with Differentiable Global Positioning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15844v1</link><description>Predicting camera-space hand meshes from single RGB images is crucial forenabling realistic hand interactions in 3D virtual and augmented worlds.Previous work typically divided the task into two stages: given a cropped imageof the hand, predict meshes in relative coordinates, followed by lifting thesepredictions into camera space in a separate and independent stage, oftenresulting in the loss of valuable contextual and scale information. To preventthe loss of these cues, we propose unifying these two stages into an end-to-endsolution that addresses the 2D-3D correspondence problem. This solution enablesback-propagation from camera space outputs to the rest of the network through anew differentiable global positioning module. We also introduce an imagerectification step that harmonizes both the training dataset and the inputimage as if they were acquired with the same camera, helping to alleviate theinherent scale-depth ambiguity of the problem. We validate the effectiveness ofour framework in evaluations against several baselines and state-of-the-artapproaches across three public benchmarks.</description><author>Eugene Valassakis, Guillermo Garcia-Hernando</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 17:59:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15844v1</guid></item><item><title>CarFormer: Self-Driving with Learned Object-Centric Representations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15843v1</link><description>The choice of representation plays a key role in self-driving. Bird's eyeview (BEV) representations have shown remarkable performance in recent years.In this paper, we propose to learn object-centric representations in BEV todistill a complex scene into more actionable information for self-driving. Wefirst learn to place objects into slots with a slot attention model on BEVsequences. Based on these object-centric representations, we then train atransformer to learn to drive as well as reason about the future of othervehicles. We found that object-centric slot representations outperform bothscene-level and object-level approaches that use the exact attributes ofobjects. Slot representations naturally incorporate information about objectsfrom their spatial and temporal context such as position, heading, and speedwithout explicitly providing it. Our model with slots achieves an increasedcompletion rate of the provided routes and, consequently, a higher drivingscore, with a lower variance across multiple runs, affirming slots as areliable alternative in object-centric approaches. Additionally, we validateour model's performance as a world model through forecasting experiments,demonstrating its capability to predict future slot representations accurately.The code and the pre-trained models can be found athttps://kuis-ai.github.io/CarFormer/.</description><author>Shadi Hamdan, Fatma GÃ¼ney</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 17:59:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15843v1</guid></item><item><title>Artist: Aesthetically Controllable Text-Driven Stylization without Training</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15842v1</link><description>Diffusion models entangle content and style generation during the denoisingprocess, leading to undesired content modification when directly applied tostylization tasks. Existing methods struggle to effectively control thediffusion model to meet the aesthetic-level requirements for stylization. Inthis paper, we introduce \textbf{Artist}, a training-free approach thataesthetically controls the content and style generation of a pretraineddiffusion model for text-driven stylization. Our key insight is to disentanglethe denoising of content and style into separate diffusion processes whilesharing information between them. We propose simple yet effective content andstyle control methods that suppress style-irrelevant content generation,resulting in harmonious stylization results. Extensive experiments demonstratethat our method excels at achieving aesthetic-level stylization requirements,preserving intricate details in the content image and aligning well with thestyle prompt. Furthermore, we showcase the highly controllability of thestylization strength from various perspectives.

Specifically, the Slow pathway extracts features at a low framerate while keeping as many spatial details as possible (e.g., with 24x24tokens), and the Fast pathway operates on a high frame rate but uses a largerspatial pooling stride (e.g., downsampling 6x) to focus on the motion cues. Asa result, this design allows us to adequately capture both spatial and temporalfeatures that are beneficial for understanding details along the video.Experimental results show that SF-LLaVA outperforms existing training-freemethods on a wide range of video tasks. On some benchmarks, it achievescomparable or even better performance compared to state-of-the-art Video LLMsthat are fine-tuned on video datasets.</description><author>Mingze Xu, Mingfei Gao, Zhe Gan, Hong-You Chen, Zhengfeng Lai, Haiming Gang, Kai Kang, Afshin Dehghan</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 17:58:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15841v1</guid></item><item><title>Machine Learning Assisted Adjustment Boosts Efficiency of Exact Inference in Randomized Controlled Trials</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03058v2</link><description>In this work, we proposed a novel inferential procedure assisted by machinelearning based adjustment for randomized control trials. The method wasdeveloped under the Rosenbaum's framework of exact tests in randomizedexperiments with covariate adjustments. Through extensive simulationexperiments, we showed the proposed method can robustly control the type Ierror and can boost the statistical efficiency for a randomized controlledtrial (RCT). This advantage was further demonstrated in a real-world example.The simplicity, flexibility, and robustness of the proposed method makes it acompetitive candidate as a routine inference procedure for RCTs, especiallywhen nonlinear association or interaction among covariates is expected.

While guided meta reinforcement learning (RL)approach that first trains a guiding policy to train the ego agent has proveneffective in improving generalizability across various levels of interaction,the state-of-the-art method tends to be overly sensitive to extreme cases,impairing the agents' performance in the more common scenarios. This studyintroduces a novel training framework that integrates guided meta RL withimportance sampling (IS) to optimize training distributions for navigatinghighly interactive driving scenarios, such as T-intersections. Unliketraditional methods that may underrepresent critical interactions oroveremphasize extreme cases during training, our approach strategically adjuststhe training distribution towards more challenging driving behaviors using ISproposal distributions and applies the importance ratio to de-bias the result.By estimating a naturalistic distribution from real-world datasets andemploying a mixture model for iterative training refinements, the frameworkensures a balanced focus across common and extreme driving scenarios.Experiments conducted with both synthetic dataset and T-intersection scenariosfrom the InD dataset demonstrate not only accelerated training but alsoimprovement in agent performance under naturalistic conditions, showcasing theefficacy of combining IS with meta RL in training reliable autonomous agentsfor highly interactive navigation tasks.</description><author>Mansur Arief, Mike Timmerman, Jiachen Li, David Isele, Mykel J Kochenderfer</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 17:57:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15839v1</guid></item><item><title>Foundation Models for Autonomous Robots in Unstructured Environments</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14296v2</link><description>Automating activities through robots in unstructured environments, such asconstruction sites, has been a long-standing desire. However, the high degreeof unpredictable events in these settings has resulted in far less adoptioncompared to more structured settings, such as manufacturing, where robots canbe hard-coded or trained on narrowly defined datasets. Recently, pretrainedfoundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstratedsuperior generalization capabilities by providing zero-shot solutions forproblems do not present in the training data, proposing them as a potentialsolution for introducing robots to unstructured environments. To this end, thisstudy investigates potential opportunities and challenges of pretrainedfoundation models from a multi-dimensional perspective. The studysystematically reviews application of foundation models in two field of roboticand unstructured environment and then synthesized them with deliberative actingtheory. Findings showed that linguistic capabilities of LLMs have been utilizedmore than other features for improving perception in human-robot interactions.On the other hand, findings showed that the use of LLMs demonstrated moreapplications in project management and safety in construction, and naturalhazard detection in disaster management. Synthesizing these findings, welocated the current state-of-the-art in this field on a five-level scale ofautomation, placing them at conditional automation. This assessment was thenused to envision future scenarios, challenges, and solutions toward autonomoussafe unstructured environments. Our study can be seen as a benchmark to trackour progress toward that future.</description><author>Hossein Naderi, Alireza Shojaei, Lifu Huang</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 17:55:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14296v2</guid></item><item><title>MMInstruct: A High-Quality Multi-Modal Instruction Tuning Dataset with Extensive Diversity</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15838v1</link><description>Despite the effectiveness of vision-language supervised fine-tuning inenhancing the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). However,existing visual instruction tuning datasets include the following limitations:(1) Instruction annotation quality: despite existing VLLMs exhibiting strongperformance, instructions generated by those advanced VLLMs may still sufferfrom inaccuracies, such as hallucinations. (2) Instructions and imagediversity: the limited range of instruction types and the lack of diversity inimage data may impact the model's ability to generate diversified and closer toreal-world scenarios outputs. To address these challenges, we construct ahigh-quality, diverse visual instruction tuning dataset MMInstruct, whichconsists of 973K instructions from 24 domains. There are four instructiontypes: Judgement, Multiple-Choice, Long Visual Question Answering and ShortVisual Question Answering. To construct MMInstruct, we propose an instructiongeneration data engine that leverages GPT-4V, GPT-3.5, and manual correction.Our instruction generation engine enables semi-automatic, low-cost, andmulti-domain instruction generation at 1/6 the cost of manual construction.Through extensive experiment validation and ablation experiments, wedemonstrate that MMInstruct could significantly improve the performance ofVLLMs, e.g., the model fine-tuning on MMInstruct achieves new state-of-the-artperformance on 10 out of 12 benchmarks.

It excels in region-aware learning and providesstrong initializations for various tasks, but struggles to capture high-levelsemantics without further supervised fine-tuning, likely due to the low-levelnature of its pixel reconstruction objective. A promising yet unrealizedframework is learning representations through masked reconstruction in latentspace, combining the locality of MIM with the high-level targets. However, thisapproach poses significant training challenges as the reconstruction targetsare learned in conjunction with the model, potentially leading to trivial orsuboptimal solutions.Our study is among the first to thoroughly analyze andaddress the challenges of such framework, which we refer to as Latent MIM.Through a series of carefully designed experiments and extensive analysis, weidentify the source of these challenges, including representation collapsingfor joint online/target optimization, learning objectives, the high regioncorrelation in latent space and decoding conditioning. By sequentiallyaddressing these issues, we demonstrate that Latent MIM can indeed learnhigh-level representations while retaining the benefits of MIM models.</description><author>Yibing Wei, Abhinav Gupta, Pedro Morgado</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 17:54:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15837v1</guid></item><item><title>NPLMV-PS: Neural Point-Light Multi-View Photometric Stereo</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12057v2</link><description>In this work we present a novel multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) method.Like many works in 3D reconstruction we are leveraging neural shaperepresentations and learnt renderers. However, our work differs from thestate-of-the-art multi-view PS methods such as PS-NeRF or Supernormal in thatwe explicitly leverage per-pixel intensity renderings rather than relyingmainly on estimated normals. We model point light attenuation and explicitly raytrace cast shadows inorder to best approximate the incoming radiance for each point. The estimatedincoming radiance is used as input to a fully neural material renderer thatuses minimal prior assumptions and it is jointly optimised with the surface.Estimated normals and segmentation maps are also incorporated in order tomaximise the surface accuracy. Our method is among the first (along with Supernormal) to outperform theclassical MVPS approach proposed by the DiLiGenT-MV benchmark and achievesaverage 0.2mm Chamfer distance for objects imaged at approx 1.5m distance awaywith approximate 400x400 resolution. Moreover, our method shows high robustnessto the sparse MVPS setup (6 views, 6 lights) greatly outperforming the SOTAcompetitor (0.38mm vs 0.61mm), illustrating the importance of neural renderingin multi-view photometric stereo.</description><author>Fotios Logothetis, Ignas Budvytis, Roberto Cipolla</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 17:52:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12057v2</guid></item><item><title>Detecting Brittle Decisions for Free: Leveraging Margin Consistency in Deep Robust Classifiers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18451v2</link><description>Despite extensive research on adversarial training strategies to improverobustness, the decisions of even the most robust deep learning models canstill be quite sensitive to imperceptible perturbations, creating serious riskswhen deploying them for high-stakes real-world applications. While detectingsuch cases may be critical, evaluating a model's vulnerability at aper-instance level using adversarial attacks is computationally too intensiveand unsuitable for real-time deployment scenarios. The input space margin isthe exact score to detect non-robust samples and is intractable for deep neuralnetworks. This paper introduces the concept of margin consistency -- a propertythat links the input space margins and the logit margins in robust models --for efficient detection of vulnerable samples. First, we establish that marginconsistency is a necessary and sufficient condition to use a model's logitmargin as a score for identifying non-robust samples. Next, throughcomprehensive empirical analysis of various robustly trained models on CIFAR10and CIFAR100 datasets, we show that they indicate strong margin consistencywith a strong correlation between their input space margins and the logitmargins. Then, we show that we can effectively use the logit margin toconfidently detect brittle decisions with such models and accurately estimaterobust accuracy on an arbitrarily large test set by estimating the inputmargins only on a small subset. Finally, we address cases where the model isnot sufficiently margin-consistent by learning a pseudo-margin from the featurerepresentation. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging deeprepresentations to efficiently assess adversarial vulnerability in deploymentscenarios.</description><author>Jonas NgnawÃ©, Sabyasachi Sahoo, Yann Pequignot, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Precioso, Christian GagnÃ©</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 17:52:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18451v2</guid></item><item><title>dMel: Speech Tokenization made Simple</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15835v1</link><description>Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing byleveraging self-supervised pretraining on vast textual data.

In this context, it is crucial to propagate theuncertainty induced by limited simulation budget and surrogate approximationerror to predictions, inference, and subsequent decision-relevant quantities.However, quantifying and then propagating the uncertainty of surrogates isusually limited to special analytic cases or is otherwise computationally veryexpensive. In this paper, we propose a framework enabling a scalable, Bayesianapproach to surrogate modeling with thorough uncertainty quantification,propagation, and validation. Specifically, we present three methods forBayesian inference with surrogate models given measurement data. This is a taskwhere the propagation of surrogate uncertainty is especially relevant, becausefailing to account for it may lead to biased and/or overconfident estimates ofthe parameters of interest. We showcase our approach in three detailed casestudies for linear and nonlinear real-world modeling scenarios. Uncertaintypropagation in surrogate models enables more reliable and safe approximation ofexpensive simulators and will therefore be useful in various fields ofapplications.</description><author>Philipp Reiser, Javier Enrique Aguilar, Anneli Guthke, Paul-Christian BÃ¼rkner</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 17:37:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05153v2</guid></item><item><title>On shallow planning under partial observability</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15820v1</link><description>Formulating a real-world problem under the Reinforcement Learning frameworkinvolves non-trivial design choices, such as selecting a discount factor forthe learning objective (discounted cumulative rewards), which articulates theplanning horizon of the agent.

Ourapproach employs a sequence of visual resamplers that capture visual details atvarious spacial scales. This architecture not only leverages global and localvisual contexts effectively, but also facilitates the flexible extension ofvisual tokens through a compound token scaling strategy, allowing up to a 16xincrease in the token count post pre-training. Consequently, Chain-of-Sightrequires significantly fewer visual tokens in the pre-training phase comparedto the fine-tuning phase. This intentional reduction of visual tokens duringpre-training notably accelerates the pre-training process, cutting down thewall-clock training time by ~73%. Empirical results on a series ofvision-language benchmarks reveal that the pre-train acceleration throughChain-of-Sight is achieved without sacrificing performance, matching orsurpassing the standard pipeline of utilizing all visual tokens throughout theentire training process. Further scaling up the number of visual tokens forpre-training leads to stronger performances, competitive to existing approachesin a series of benchmarks.</description><author>Ziyuan Huang, Kaixiang Ji, Biao Gong, Zhiwu Qing, Qinglong Zhang, Kecheng Zheng, Jian Wang, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 17:33:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15819v1</guid></item><item><title>Enhancing Cell Instance Segmentation in Scanning Electron Microscopy Images via a Deep Contour Closing Operator</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15817v1</link><description>Accurately segmenting and individualizing cells in SEM images is a highlypromising technique for elucidating tissue architecture in oncology. Whilecurrent AI-based methods are effective, errors persist, necessitatingtime-consuming manual corrections, particularly in areas where the quality ofcell contours in the image is poor and requires gap filling. This studypresents a novel AI-driven approach for refining cell boundary delineation toimprove instance-based cell segmentation in SEM images, also reducing thenecessity for residual manual correction. A CNN COp-Net is introduced toaddress gaps in cell contours, effectively filling in regions with deficient orabsent information. The network takes as input cell contour probability mapswith potentially inadequate or missing information and outputs corrected cellcontour delineations. The lack of training data was addressed by generating lowintegrity probability maps using a tailored PDE. We showcase the efficacy ofour approach in augmenting cell boundary precision using both private SEMimages from PDX hepatoblastoma tissues and publicly accessible images datasets.The proposed cell contour closing operator exhibits a notable improvement intested datasets, achieving respectively close to 50% (private data) and 10%(public data) increase in the accurately-delineated cell proportion compared tostate-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the need for manual corrections wassignificantly reduced, therefore facilitating the overall digitalizationprocess. Our results demonstrate a notable enhancement in the accuracy of cellinstance segmentation, particularly in highly challenging regions where imagequality compromises the integrity of cell boundaries, necessitating gapfilling.

While prior work has established that there ispopulation-level agreement in terms of how humans interpret these expressions,there has been little inquiry into the abilities of language models tointerpret such expressions. In this paper, we investigate how language modelsmap linguistic expressions of uncertainty to numerical responses. Our approachassesses whether language models can employ theory of mind in this setting:understanding the uncertainty of another agent about a particular statement,independently of the model's own certainty about that statement. We evaluateboth humans and 10 popular language models on a task created to assess theseabilities. Unexpectedly, we find that 8 out of 10 models are able to mapuncertainty expressions to probabilistic responses in a human-like manner.However, we observe systematically different behavior depending on whether astatement is actually true or false. This sensitivity indicates that languagemodels are substantially more susceptible to bias based on their priorknowledge (as compared to humans).

Most platforms are designed in a limited set ofcountries but deployed in worldwide, without adequate checkpoints. This isespecially problematic for Global South countries which lack strong legislationto safeguard persons facing disparate performance of these systems. Acombination of unavailability of datasets, lack of understanding of FRSfunctionality and low-resource bias mitigation measures accentuate the problem.In this work, we propose a new face dataset composed of 6,579 unique male andfemale sportspersons from eight countries around the world. More than 50% ofthe dataset comprises individuals from the Global South countries and isdemographically diverse. To aid adversarial audits and robust model training,each image has four adversarial variants, totaling over 40,000 images. We alsobenchmark five popular FRSs, both commercial and open-source, for the task ofgender prediction (and country prediction for one of the open-source models asan example of red-teaming). Experiments on industrial FRSs reveal accuraciesranging from 98.2%--38.1%, with a large disparity between males and females inthe Global South (max difference of 38.5%). Biases are also observed in allFRSs between females of the Global North and South (max difference of ~50%).Grad-CAM analysis identifies the nose, forehead and mouth as the regions ofinterest on one of the open-source FRSs.

Current methodologies typicallyassume continuous availability of speech and facial modality data, neglectingreal-world scenarios where these data may be intermittently unavailable, whichoften results in model failures. Furthermore, despite utilising advanced deeplearning models to extract information from the speaker's multimodal inputs,these models fail to adequately leverage the speaker's emotional context, whichis vital for eliciting appropriate facial reactions from human listeners. Toaddress these limitations, we propose an Emotion-aware Modality Compensatory(EMC) framework. This versatile solution can be seamlessly integrated intoexisting models, thereby preserving their advantages while significantlyenhancing performance and robustness in scenarios with missing modalities. Ourframework ensures resilience when faced with missing modality data through theCompensatory Modality Alignment (CMA) module. It also generates moreappropriate emotion-aware reactions via the Emotion-aware Attention (EA)module, which incorporates the speaker's emotional information throughout theentire encoding and decoding process. Experimental results demonstrate that ourframework improves the appropriateness metric FRCorr by an average of 57.2\%compared to the original model structure. In scenarios where speech modalitydata is missing, the performance of appropriate generation shows animprovement, and when facial data is missing, it only exhibits minimaldegradation.</description><author>Guanyu Hu, Jie Wei, Siyang Song, Dimitrios Kollias, Xinyu Yang, Zhonglin Sun, Odysseus Kaloidas</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 17:00:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15798v1</guid></item><item><title>MILAN: Milli-Annotations for Lidar Semantic Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15797v1</link><description>Annotating lidar point clouds for autonomous driving is a notoriouslyexpensive and time-consuming task.

This study introduces AdaCLIPfor the ZSAD task, leveraging a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), CLIP.AdaCLIP incorporates learnable prompts into CLIP and optimizes them throughtraining on auxiliary annotated anomaly detection data. Two types of learnableprompts are proposed: static and dynamic. Static prompts are shared across allimages, serving to preliminarily adapt CLIP for ZSAD. In contrast, dynamicprompts are generated for each test image, providing CLIP with dynamicadaptation capabilities.

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multipleindependent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case ofend-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due tothe difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient objectpresence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation ofsurgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of thefield of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered inWSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks(VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information usingsemi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activationmaps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts whenspecifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided workswith a student network that integrates information over time by leveragingtemporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a publicreference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset whereobjects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Ourmethod outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superiorsegmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</description><author>Guiqiu Liao, Matjaz Jogan, Sai Koushik, Eric Eaton, Daniel A.

While strong guarantees are availablewhen the outlier fraction is significantly smaller than the minimum mixingweight, much less is known when outliers may crowd out low-weight clusters - asetting we refer to as list-decodable mixture learning (LD-ML). In this case,adversarial outliers can simulate additional spurious mixture components.Hence, if all means of the mixture must be recovered up to a small error in theoutput list, the list size needs to be larger than the number of (true)components. We propose an algorithm that obtains order-optimal error guaranteesfor each mixture mean with a minimal list-size overhead, significantlyimproving upon list-decodable mean estimation, the only existing method that isapplicable for LD-ML. Although improvements are observed even when the mixtureis non-separated, our algorithm achieves particularly strong guarantees whenthe mixture is separated: it can leverage the mixture structure to partiallycluster the samples before carefully iterating a base learner forlist-decodable mean estimation at different scales.</description><author>Daniil Dmitriev, Rares-Darius Buhai, Stefan Tiegel, Alexander Wolters, Gleb Novikov, Amartya Sanyal, David Steurer, Fanny Yang</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 16:51:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15792v1</guid></item><item><title>RADA: Robust and Accurate Feature Learning with Domain Adaptation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15791v1</link><description>Recent advancements in keypoint detection and descriptor extraction haveshown impressive performance in local feature learning tasks.

Mastoidectomy is a surgicalprocedure that uses a high-speed drill to remove part of the mastoid region ofthe temporal bone, providing safe access to the cochlea through the middle andinner ear. We aim to develop an intraoperative navigation system that registersplans created using 3D preoperative Computerized Tomography (CT) volumes withthe 2D surgical microscope view. Herein, we propose a method to synthesize themastoidectomy volume using only the preoperative CT scan, where the mastoid isintact. We introduce an unsupervised learning framework designed to synthesizemastoidectomy. For model training purposes, this method uses postoperative CTscans to avoid manual data cleaning or labeling, even when the region removedduring mastoidectomy is visible but affected by metal artifacts, lowsignal-to-noise ratio, or electrode wiring. Our approach estimatesmastoidectomy regions with a mean dice score of 70.0%.

The ability totransfer and generalize knowledge gained from previous experiences todownstream tasks can significantly improve sample efficiency. Recent researchindicates that successor feature (SF) RL algorithms enable knowledgegeneralization between tasks with different rewards but identical transitiondynamics. It has recently been hypothesized that combining model-based (MB)methods with SF algorithms can alleviate the limitation of fixed transitiondynamics. Furthermore, uncertainty-aware exploration is widely recognized asanother appealing approach for improving sample efficiency. Putting togethertwo ideas of hybrid model-based successor feature (MB-SF) and uncertainty leadsto an approach to the problem of sample efficient uncertainty-aware knowledgetransfer across tasks with different transition dynamics or/and rewardfunctions. In this paper, the uncertainty of the value of each action isapproximated by a Kalman filter (KF)-based multiple-model adaptive estimation.This KF-based framework treats the parameters of a model as random variables.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at formulating a hybridMB-SF algorithm capable of generalizing knowledge across large or continuousstate space tasks with various transition dynamics while requiring lesscomputation at decision time than MB methods. The number of samples required tolearn the tasks was compared to recent SF and MB baselines. The results showthat our algorithm generalizes its knowledge across different transitiondynamics, learns downstream tasks with significantly fewer samples thanstarting from scratch, and outperforms existing approaches.</description><author>Parvin Malekzadeh, Ming Hou, Konstantinos N.

By extracting textual cuesfrom their prior posts, and contrasting their prevalence against randomsocial-media users and others (e.g., those with similar socio-demographics,political news-sharers, and fact-check sharers), researchers can identify cuesthat distinguish fake-news sharers, predict those most likely to share fakenews, and identify promising constructs to build interventions. Our researchincludes studies along these lines. In Study 1, we explore the distinctivelanguage patterns of fake-news sharers, highlighting elements such as theirhigher use of anger and power-related words. In Study 2, we show that addingtextual cues into predictive models enhances their accuracy in predictingfake-news sharers. In Study 3, we explore the contrasting role of trait andsituational anger, and show trait anger is associated with a greater propensityto share both true and fake news. In Study 4, we introduce a way toauthenticate Twitter accounts in surveys, before using it to explore howcrafting an ad copy that resonates with users' sense of power encourages theadoption of fact-checking tools.

However, a significantlimitation in prior work is the assumption that human annotations for theseconcepts are readily available during training, necessitating continuousreal-time input from human annotators. To overcome this limitation, weintroduce a novel training scheme that enables RL algorithms to efficientlylearn a concept-based policy by only querying humans to label a small set ofdata, or in the extreme case, without any human labels. Our algorithm,LICORICE, involves three main contributions: interleaving concept learning andRL training, using a concept ensembles to actively select informative datapoints for labeling, and decorrelating the concept data with a simple strategy.We show how LICORICE reduces manual labeling efforts to to 500 or fewer conceptlabels in three environments. Finally, we present an initial study to explorehow we can use powerful vision-language models to infer concepts from rawvisual inputs without explicit labels at minimal cost to performance.</description><author>Zhuorui Ye, Stephanie Milani, Geoffrey J.

However, their potentialremains largely unexplored in the field of resource allocation in wirelessnetworks. This paper introduces a novel diffusion model-based resourceallocation strategy for Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs) with theobjective of minimizing total power consumption through the optimization of thesampling period in the control system, and blocklength and packet errorprobability in the finite blocklength regime of the communication system. Theproblem is first reduced to the optimization of blocklength only based on thederivation of the optimality conditions. Then, the optimization theory solutioncollects a dataset of channel gains and corresponding optimal blocklengths.Finally, the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) uses this collecteddataset to train the resource allocation algorithm that generates optimalblocklength values conditioned on the channel state information (CSI). Viaextensive simulations, the proposed approach is shown to outperform previouslyproposed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based approaches with close tooptimal performance regarding total power consumption. Moreover, an improvementof up to eighteen-fold in the reduction of critical constraint violations isobserved, further underscoring the accuracy of the solution.</description><author>Amirhassan Babazadeh Darabi, Sinem Coleri</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 16:44:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15784v1</guid></item><item><title>Interrogating AI: Characterizing Emergent Playful Interactions with ChatGPT</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08405v2</link><description>In an era of AI's growing capabilities and influences, recent advancementsare constantly reshaping HCI and CSCW's view of AI.

While most ofthe previous works in the literature focus on the task of image classification,we go beyond this and study the texture bias of CNNs in semantic segmentation.In this work, we propose to train CNNs on pre-processed images with lesstexture to reduce the texture bias. Therein, the challenge is to suppress imagetexture while preserving shape information. To this end, we utilize edgeenhancing diffusion (EED), an anisotropic image diffusion method initiallyintroduced for image compression, to create texture reduced duplicates ofexisting datasets. Extensive numerical studies are performed with both CNNs andvision transformer models trained on original data and EED-processed data fromthe Cityscapes dataset and the CARLA driving simulator. We observe strongtexture-dependence of CNNs and moderate texture-dependence of transformers.Training CNNs on EED-processed images enables the models to become completelyignorant with respect to texture, demonstrating resilience with respect totexture re-introduction to any degree. Additionally we analyze the performancereduction in depth on a level of connected components in the semanticsegmentation and study the influence of EED pre-processing on domaingeneralization as well as adversarial robustness.</description><author>Edgar Heinert, Matthias Rottmann, Kira Maag, Karsten Kahl</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 16:42:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09530v2</guid></item><item><title>FAIntbench: A Holistic and Precise Benchmark for Bias Evaluation in Text-to-Image Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17814v4</link><description>The rapid development and reduced barriers to entry for Text-to-Image (T2I)models have raised concerns about the biases in their outputs, but existingresearch lacks a holistic definition and evaluation framework of biases,limiting the enhancement of debiasing techniques.

However, during theopen-world inference process, there are inevitably test data instances fromunknown classes, commonly referred to as outliers. This paper pays attention tothe problem that conducts both sample recognition and outlier rejection duringinference while outliers exist. To address this problem, we propose a newapproach called STAble Memory rePlay (STAMP), which performs optimization overa stable memory bank instead of the risky mini-batch. In particular, the memorybank is dynamically updated by selecting low-entropy and label-consistentsamples in a class-balanced manner. In addition, we develop a self-weightedentropy minimization strategy that assigns higher weight to low-entropysamples.

Crucially, the success ofobject grasping highly demands a comprehensive understanding of the shape ofobjects within the scene. However, single-view observations often suffer fromocclusions (including both self and inter-object occlusions), which lead togaps in the point clouds, especially in complex cluttered scenes. This rendersincomplete perception of the object shape and frequently causes failures orinaccurate pose estimation during object grasping. In this paper, we tacklethis issue with an effective albeit simple solution, namely completinggrasping-related scene regions through local occupancy prediction. Followingprior practice, the proposed model first runs by proposing a number of mostlikely grasp points in the scene. Around each grasp point, a module is designedto infer any voxel in its neighborhood to be either void or occupied by someobject. Importantly, the occupancy map is inferred by fusing both local andglobal cues. We implement a multi-group tri-plane scheme for efficientlyaggregating long-distance contextual information. The model further estimates6-DoF grasp poses utilizing the local occupancy-enhanced object shapeinformation and returns the top-ranked grasp proposal. Comprehensiveexperiments on both the large-scale GraspNet-1Billion benchmark and realrobotic arm demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively complete theunobserved parts in cluttered and occluded scenes. Benefiting from theoccupancy-enhanced feature, our model clearly outstrips other competing methodsunder various performance metrics such as grasping average precision.</description><author>Kangqi Ma, Hao Dong, Yadong Mu</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 16:22:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15771v1</guid></item><item><title>Towards Open-World Object-based Anomaly Detection via Self-Supervised Outlier Synthesis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15763v1</link><description>Object detection is a pivotal task in computer vision that has receivedsignificant attention in previous years. Nonetheless, the capability of adetector to localise objects out of the training distribution remainsunexplored. Whilst recent approaches in object-level out-of-distribution (OoD)detection heavily rely on class labels, such approaches contradict trulyopen-world scenarios where the class distribution is often unknown. In thiscontext, anomaly detection focuses on detecting unseen instances rather thanclassifying detections as OoD. This work aims to bridge this gap by leveragingan open-world object detector and an OoD detector via virtual outliersynthesis. This is achieved by using the detector backbone features to firstlearn object pseudo-classes via self-supervision. These pseudo-classes serve asthe basis for class-conditional virtual outlier sampling of anomalous featuresthat are classified by an OoD head. Our approach empowers our overall objectdetector architecture to learn anomaly-aware feature representations withoutrelying on class labels, hence enabling truly open-world object anomalydetection. Empirical validation of our approach demonstrates its effectivenessacross diverse datasets encompassing various imaging modalities (visible,infrared, and X-ray). Moreover, our method establishes state-of-the-artperformance on object-level anomaly detection, achieving an average recallscore improvement of over 5.4% for natural images and 23.5% for a securityX-ray dataset compared to the current approaches. In addition, our methoddetects anomalies in datasets where current approaches fail. Code available athttps://github.com/KostadinovShalon/oln-ssos.</description><author>Brian K. S.

Building on techniques from multi-task training andparameter-efficient finetuning, CLP can learn steerable models that effectivelytrade-off conflicting objectives at inference time.

However, previouswork has shown that most feature-level adaptation methods, which employadversarial training and are validated on synthetic-to-real adaptation, providemarginal gains in condition-level adaptation, being outperformed by simplepixel-level adaptation via stylization. Motivated by these findings, we proposeto leverage stylization in performing feature-level adaptation by aligning theinternal network features extracted by the encoder of the network from theoriginal and the stylized view of each input image with a novel featureinvariance loss. In this way, we encourage the encoder to extract features thatare already invariant to the style of the input, allowing the decoder to focuson parsing these features and not on further abstracting from the specificstyle of the input. We implement our method, named Condition-Invariant SemanticSegmentation (CISS), on the current state-of-the-art domain adaptationarchitecture and achieve outstanding results on condition-level adaptation. Inparticular, CISS sets the new state of the art in the populardaytime-to-nighttime Cityscapes$\to$Dark Zurich benchmark.

Albeit the progress, few public benchmark is available to measure suchdevelopment. To mitigate this gap, we introduce LongVideoBench, aquestion-answering benchmark that features video-language interleaved inputs upto an hour long. Our benchmark includes 3,763 varying-length web-collectedvideos with their subtitles across diverse themes, designed to comprehensivelyevaluate LMMs on long-term multimodal understanding. To achieve this, weinterpret the primary challenge as to accurately retrieve and reason overdetailed multimodal information from long inputs. As such, we formulate a novelvideo question-answering task termed referring reasoning. Specifically, as partof the question, it contains a referring query that references related videocontexts, called referred context. The model is then required to reason overrelevant video details from the referred context. Following the paradigm ofreferring reasoning, we curate 6,678 human-annotated multiple-choice questionsin 17 fine-grained categories, establishing one of the most comprehensivebenchmarks for long-form video understanding. Evaluations suggest that theLongVideoBench presents significant challenges even for the most advancedproprietary models (e.g. GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, GPT-4-Turbo), while theiropen-source counterparts show an even larger performance gap. In addition, ourresults indicate that model performance on the benchmark improves only whenthey are capable of processing more frames, positioning LongVideoBench as avaluable benchmark for evaluating future-generation long-context LMMs.</description><author>Haoning Wu, Dongxu Li, Bei Chen, Junnan Li</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 16:00:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15754v1</guid></item><item><title>Robustness of Speech Separation Models for Similar-pitch Speakers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15749v1</link><description>Single-channel speech separation is a crucial task for enhancing speechrecognition systems in multi-speaker environments.

MoRSE aims to providecomprehensive and complete knowledge about cybersecurity. MoRSE uses two RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems designed to retrieve and organizeinformation from multidimensional cybersecurity contexts. MoRSE differs fromtraditional RAGs by using parallel retrievers that work together to retrievesemantically related information in different formats and structures. Unliketraditional Large Language Models (LLMs) that rely on Parametric KnowledgeBases, MoRSE retrieves relevant documents from Non-Parametric Knowledge Basesin response to user queries. Subsequently, MoRSE uses this information togenerate accurate answers. In addition, MoRSE benefits from real-time updatesto its knowledge bases, enabling continuous knowledge enrichment withoutretraining. We have evaluated the effectiveness of MoRSE against otherstate-of-the-art LLMs, evaluating the system on 600 cybersecurity specificquestions.

In this work, we challenge this constraint andextend the domain of this task to general natural images. To this end, weintroduce: 1. the ADE-OoD benchmark, which is based on the ADE20k dataset andincludes images from diverse domains with a high semantic diversity, and 2. anovel approach that uses Diffusion score matching for OoD detection (DOoD) andis robust to the increased semantic diversity. ADE-OoD features indoor andoutdoor images, defines 150 semantic categories as in-distribution, andcontains a variety of OoD objects. For DOoD, we train a diffusion model with anMLP architecture on semantic in-distribution embeddings and build on the scorematching interpretation to compute pixel-wise OoD scores at inference time. Oncommon road scene OoD benchmarks, DOoD performs on par or better than the stateof the art, without using outliers for training or making assumptions about thedata domain. On ADE-OoD, DOoD outperforms previous approaches, but leaves muchroom for future improvements.</description><author>Silvio Galesso, Philipp SchrÃ¶ppel, Hssan Driss, Thomas Brox</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 15:41:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15739v1</guid></item><item><title>Parallel Split Learning with Global Sampling</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15738v1</link><description>The expansion of IoT devices and the demands of Deep Learning havehighlighted significant challenges in Distributed Deep Learning (DDL) systems.Parallel Split Learning (PSL) has emerged as a promising derivative of SplitLearning that is well suited for distributed learning on resource-constraineddevices. However, PSL faces several obstacles, such as large effective batchsizes, non-IID data distributions, and the straggler effect. We view theseissues as a sampling dilemma and propose to address them by orchestrating themini-batch sampling process on the server side. We introduce the Uniform GlobalSampling (UGS) method to decouple the effective batch size from the number ofclients and reduce mini-batch deviation in non-IID settings. To address thestraggler effect, we introduce the Latent Dirichlet Sampling (LDS) method,which generalizes UGS to balance the trade-off between batch deviation andtraining time. Our simulations reveal that our proposed methods enhance modelaccuracy by up to 34.1% in non-IID settings and reduce the training time in thepresence of stragglers by up to 62%. In particular, LDS effectively mitigatesthe straggler effect without compromising model accuracy or adding significantcomputational overhead compared to UGS. Our results demonstrate the potentialof our methods as a promising solution for DDL in real applications.</description><author>Mohammad Kohankhaki, Ahmad Ayad, Mahdi Barhoush, Anke Schmeink</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 15:41:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15738v1</guid></item><item><title>OMoS-QA: A Dataset for Cross-Lingual Extractive Question Answering in a German Migration Context</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15736v1</link><description>When immigrating to a new country, it is easy to feel overwhelmed by the needto obtain information on financial support, housing, schooling, languagecourses, and other issues.

Inspired by work highlighting thesignificance of the modality gap in contrastive dual-encoders, we propose theInter-Intra Modal Measure (IIMM). Combining terms quantifying the similaritybetween image embeddings and the similarity between incorrect image and labelembedding pairs, the IIMM functions as a strong predictor of performancechanges with fine-tuning. Our extensive empirical analysis across fourstate-of-the-art vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, CoCa, EVA-02-CLIP) andfive fine-tuning techniques (full fine-tuning, BitFit, attention-weight tuning,LoRA, CLIP-Adapter) demonstrates a strong, statistically significant linearrelationship: fine-tuning on tasks with higher IIMM scores produces greaterin-domain performance gains but also induces more severe out-of-domainperformance degradation, with some parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)methods showing extreme forgetting. We compare our measure against transferscores from state-of-the-art model selection methods and show that the IIMM issignificantly more predictive of accuracy gains. With only a single forwardpass of the target data, practitioners can leverage this key insight toheuristically evaluate the degree to which a model can be expected to improvefollowing fine-tuning. Given additional knowledge about the model's performanceon a few diverse tasks, this heuristic further evolves into a strong predictorof expected performance changes when training for new tasks.</description><author>Laura Niss, Kevin Vogt-Lowell, Theodoros Tsiligkaridis</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 15:35:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15731v1</guid></item><item><title>Explorative Imitation Learning: A Path Signature Approach for Continuous Environments</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04856v2</link><description>Some imitation learning methods combine behavioural cloning withself-supervision to infer actions from state pairs.

Our approach includes a combination of vision-language models thatsegment the CT scans, which are then fed to a deep neural architecture, namedRACNet, for Covid-19 detection. In particular, a novel framework, namedSAM2CLIP2SAM, is introduced for segmentation that leverages the strengths ofboth Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training(CLIP) to accurately segment the right and left lungs in CT scans, subsequentlyfeeding these segmented outputs into RACNet for classification of COVID-19 andnon-COVID-19 cases. At first, SAM produces multiple part-based segmentationmasks for each slice in the CT scan; then CLIP selects only the masks that areassociated with the regions of interest (ROIs), i.e., the right and left lungs;finally SAM is given these ROIs as prompts and generates the final segmentationmask for the lungs. Experiments are presented across two Covid-19 annotateddatabases which illustrate the improved performance obtained when our methodhas been used for segmentation of the CT scans.</description><author>Dimitrios Kollias, Anastasios Arsenos, James Wingate, Stefanos Kollias</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 15:31:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15728v1</guid></item><item><title>Inferring turbulent velocity and temperature fields and their statistics from Lagrangian velocity measurements using physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15727v1</link><description>We propose the Artificial Intelligence Velocimetry-Thermometry (AIVT) methodto infer hidden temperature fields from experimental turbulent velocity data.This physics-informed machine learning method enables us to infer continuoustemperature fields using only sparse velocity data, hence eliminating the needfor direct temperature measurements.

We applyAIVT to a unique set of experimental volumetric and simultaneous temperatureand velocity data of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) that we acquired bycombining Particle Image Thermometry and Lagrangian Particle Tracking. Thisallows us to compare AIVT predictions and measurements directly.

However, dataset diversity is incompletelyunderstood. The current best practice is to try to maximize dataset size andclass balance. Yet large, class-balanced datasets are not guaranteed to bediverse: images can still be arbitrarily similar. We hypothesized that, for agiven model architecture, better model performance can be achieved bymaximizing dataset diversity more directly. This could open a path forperformance improvement without additional computational resources orarchitectural advances. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a comprehensiveframework of diversity measures, developed in ecology, that generalizesfamiliar quantities like Shannon entropy by accounting for similarities anddifferences among images. (Dataset size and class balance emerge from thisframework as special cases.) By analyzing thousands of subsets from sevenmedical datasets representing ultrasound, X-ray, CT, and pathology images, wefound that the best correlates of performance were not size or class balancebut $A$ -- ``big alpha'' -- a set of generalized entropy measures interpretedas the effective number of image-class pairs in the dataset, after accountingfor similarities among images. One of these, $A_0$, explained 67\% of thevariance in balanced accuracy across all subsets, vs. 54\% for class balanceand just 39\% for size. The best pair was size and $A_1$ (79\%), whichoutperformed size and class balance (74\%). $A$ performed best for subsets fromindividual datasets as well as across datasets, supporting the generality ofthese results. We propose maximizing $A$ as a potential new way to improve theperformance of deep learning in medical imaging.</description><author>Josiah Couch, Ramy Arnaout, Rima Arnaout</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 15:28:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15724v1</guid></item><item><title>DStruct2Design: Data and Benchmarks for Data Structure Driven Generative Floor Plan Design</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15723v1</link><description>Text conditioned generative models for images have yielded impressiveresults.

However there aremany use cases in floorpla generation where numerical properties of thegenerated result are more important than the aesthetics. For instance, onemight want to specify sizes for certain rooms in a floorplan and compare thegenerated floorplan with given specifications Current approaches, datasets andcommonly used evaluations do not support these kinds of constraints. As such,an attractive strategy is to generate an intermediate data structure thatcontains numerical properties of a floorplan which can be used to generate thefinal floorplan image. To explore this setting we (1) construct a new datasetfor this data-structure to data-structure formulation of floorplan generationusing two popular image based floorplan datasets RPLAN and ProcTHOR-10k, andprovide the tools to convert further procedurally generated ProcTHOR floorplandata into our format. (2) We explore the task of floorplan generation given apartial or complete set of constraints and we design a series of metrics andbenchmarks to enable evaluating how well samples generated from models respectthe constraints. (3) We create multiple baselines by finetuning a largelanguage model (LLM), Llama3, and demonstrate the feasibility of usingfloorplan data structure conditioned LLMs for the problem of floorplangeneration respecting numerical constraints.

Despite LLM's tremendous success, how they approach compositetasks, especially those not encountered during the pretraining phase, remainsan open question and largely ununderstood. In this study, we delve into the ICLcapabilities of LLMs on composite tasks, with only simple tasks as in-contextexamples. We develop a test suite of composite tasks that include linguisticand logical challenges and perform empirical studies across different LLMfamilies. We observe that models exhibit divergent behaviors: (1) For simplercomposite tasks that apply distinct mapping mechanisms to different inputsegments, the models demonstrate decent compositional ability, while scaling upthe model enhances this ability; (2) for more complex composite tasks thatinvolving reasoning multiple steps, where each step represent one task, modelstypically underperform, and scaling up generally provide no improvements. Weoffer theoretical analysis in a simplified setting, explaining that modelsexhibit compositional capability when the task handles different input partsseparately.

Clinical trials indicate thatearly targeted interventions for MCI patients can potentially slow or halt thedevelopment and progression of AD. Previous research has shown that accuratemedical classification requires the inclusion of extensive multimodal data,such as assessment scales and various neuroimaging techniques like MagneticResonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). However,consistently tracking the diagnosis of the same individual over time andsimultaneously collecting multimodal data poses significant challenges. Toaddress this issue, we introduce GFE-Mamba, a classifier based on GenerativeFeature Extraction (GFE). This classifier effectively integrates data fromassessment scales, MRI, and PET, enabling deeper multimodal fusion. Itefficiently extracts both long and short sequence information and incorporatesadditional information beyond the pixel space. This approach not only improvesclassification accuracy but also enhances the interpretability and stability ofthe model. We constructed datasets of over 3000 samples based on theAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for a two-step trainingprocess.

Theprevailing structures in existing crack segmentation networks predominantlyconsist of CNNs or Transformers. However, CNNs exhibit a deficiency in globalmodeling capability, hindering the representation to entire crack features.Transformers can capture long-range dependencies but suffer from high andquadratic complexity. Recently, Mamba has garnered extensive attention due toits linear spatial and computational complexity and its powerful globalperception. This study explores the representation capabilities of Mamba tocrack features. Specifically, this paper uncovers the connection between Mambaand the attention mechanism, providing a profound insight, an attentionperspective, into interpreting Mamba and devising a novel Mamba modulefollowing the principles of attention blocks, namely CrackMamba. We compareCrackMamba with the most prominent visual Mamba modules, Vim and Vmamba, on twodatasets comprising asphalt pavement and concrete pavement cracks, and steelcracks, respectively. The quantitative results show that CrackMamba stands outas the sole Mamba block consistently enhancing the baseline model's performanceacross all evaluation measures, while reducing its parameters and computationalcosts. Moreover, this paper substantiates that Mamba can achieve globalreceptive fields through both theoretical analysis and visual interpretability.The discoveries of this study offer a dual contribution. First, as aplug-and-play and simple yet effective Mamba module, CrackMamba exhibitsimmense potential for integration into various crack segmentation models.Second, the proposed innovative Mamba design concept, integrating Mamba withthe attention mechanism, holds significant reference value for all Mamba-basedcomputer vision models, not limited to crack segmentation networks, asinvestigated in this study.</description><author>Zhili He, Yu-Hsing Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 15:21:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15714v1</guid></item><item><title>AssistantBench: Can Web Agents Solve Realistic and Time-Consuming Tasks?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15711v1</link><description>Language agents, built on top of language models (LMs), are systems that caninteract with complex environments, such as the open web. In this work, weexamine whether such agents can perform realistic and time-consuming tasks onthe web, e.g., monitoring real-estate markets or locating relevant nearbybusinesses. We introduce AssistantBench, a challenging new benchmark consistingof 214 realistic tasks that can be automatically evaluated, covering differentscenarios and domains. We find that AssistantBench exposes the limitations ofcurrent systems, including language models and retrieval-augmented languagemodels, as no model reaches an accuracy of more than 25 points. Whileclosed-book LMs perform well, they exhibit low precision since they tend tohallucinate facts. State-of-the-art web agents reach a score of near zero.Additionally, we introduce SeePlanAct (SPA), a new web agent that significantlyoutperforms previous agents, and an ensemble of SPA and closed-book modelsreaches the best overall performance. Moreover, we analyze failures of currentsystems and highlight that web navigation remains a major challenge.</description><author>Ori Yoran, Samuel Joseph Amouyal, Chaitanya Malaviya, Ben Bogin, Ofir Press, Jonathan Berant</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 15:18:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15711v1</guid></item><item><title>SwinSF: Image Reconstruction from Spatial-Temporal Spike Streams</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15708v1</link><description>The spike camera, with its high temporal resolution, low latency, and highdynamic range, addresses high-speed imaging challenges like motion blur. Itcaptures photons at each pixel independently, creating binary spike streamsrich in temporal information but challenging for image reconstruction. Currentalgorithms, both traditional and deep learning-based, still need to be improvedin the utilization of the rich temporal detail and the restoration of thedetails of the reconstructed image. To overcome this, we introduce SwinSpikeformer (SwinSF), a novel model for dynamic scene reconstruction from spikestreams. SwinSF is composed of Spike Feature Extraction, Spatial-TemporalFeature Extraction, and Final Reconstruction Module. It combines shifted windowself-attention and proposed temporal spike attention, ensuring a comprehensivefeature extraction that encapsulates both spatial and temporal dynamics,leading to a more robust and accurate reconstruction of spike streams.Furthermore, we build a new synthesized dataset for spike image reconstructionwhich matches the resolution of the latest spike camera, ensuring its relevanceand applicability to the latest developments in spike camera imaging.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network SwinSF sets a newbenchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a series of datasets,including both real-world and synthesized data across various resolutions.

No single trackerremains the best performer across all tracking attributes and datasets. Tobridge this gap, for a given video sequence, we predict the "Best of the NTrackers", called the BofN meta-tracker. At its core, a Tracking PerformancePrediction Network (TP2N) selects a predicted best performing visual trackerfor the given video sequence using only a few initial frames. We also introducea frame-level BofN meta-tracker which keeps predicting best performer afterregular temporal intervals. The TP2N is based on self-supervised learningarchitectures MocoV2, SwAv, BT, and DINO; experiments show that the DINO withViT-S as a backbone performs the best. The video-level BofN meta-trackeroutperforms, by a large margin, existing SOTA trackers on nine standardbenchmarks - LaSOT, TrackingNet, GOT-10K, VOT2019, VOT2021, VOT2022, UAV123,OTB100, and WebUAV-3M. Further improvement is achieved by the frame-level BofNmeta-tracker effectively handling variations in the tracking scenarios withinlong sequences. For instance, on GOT-10k, BofN meta-tracker average overlap is88.7% and 91.1% with video and frame-level settings respectively. The bestperforming tracker, RTS, achieves 85.20% AO. On VOT2022, BofN expected averageoverlap is 67.88% and 70.98% with video and frame level settings, compared tothe best performing ARTrack, 64.12%.

Nevertheless, the absenceof detailed body information in skeletons restricts performance, while othermultimodal methods require substantial inference resources and are inefficientwhen using multimodal data during both training and inference stages. Toaddress this and fully harness the complementary multimodal features, wepropose a novel multi-modality co-learning (MMCL) framework by leveraging themultimodal large language models (LLMs) as auxiliary networks for efficientskeleton-based action recognition, which engages in multi-modality co-learningduring the training stage and keeps efficiency by employing only conciseskeletons in inference. Our MMCL framework primarily consists of two modules.First, the Feature Alignment Module (FAM) extracts rich RGB features from videoframes and aligns them with global skeleton features via contrastive learning.Second, the Feature Refinement Module (FRM) uses RGB images with temporalinformation and text instruction to generate instructive features based on thepowerful generalization of multimodal LLMs. These instructive text featureswill further refine the classification scores and the refined scores willenhance the model's robustness and generalization in a manner similar to softlabels. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and Northwestern-UCLAbenchmarks consistently verify the effectiveness of our MMCL, which outperformsthe existing skeleton-based action recognition methods. Meanwhile, experimentson UTD-MHAD and SYSU-Action datasets demonstrate the commendable generalizationof our MMCL in zero-shot and domain-adaptive action recognition.

The resulting models can be generalizedseamlessly to novel segmentation tasks, significantly reducing the labeling andtraining costs compared with conventional pipelines. However, in-contextsegmentation is more challenging than classic ones requiring the model to learnsegmentation rules conditioned on a few samples. Unlike previous work withad-hoc or non-end-to-end designs, we propose SEGIC, an end-to-endsegment-in-context framework built upon a single vision foundation model (VFM).In particular, SEGIC leverages the emergent correspondence within VFM tocapture dense relationships between target images and in-context samples. Assuch, information from in-context samples is then extracted into three types ofinstructions, i.e. geometric, visual, and meta instructions, serving asexplicit conditions for the final mask prediction. SEGIC is a straightforwardyet effective approach that yields state-of-the-art performance on one-shotsegmentation benchmarks. Notably, SEGIC can be easily generalized to diversetasks, including video object segmentation and open-vocabulary segmentation.Code will be available at https://github.com/MengLcool/SEGIC.</description><author>Lingchen Meng, Shiyi Lan, Hengduo Li, Jose M.

But these models do not estimate theprobability density distribution when trained on regression problems, yetobtaining full probabilistic outputs is crucial to many fields of science,where the probability distribution of the answer can be non-Gaussian andmultimodal. In this work, we demonstrate that training a probabilistic modelusing a denoising diffusion head on top of the Transformer provides reasonableprobability density estimation even for high-dimensional inputs. The combinedTransformer+Denoising Diffusion model allows conditioning the outputprobability density on arbitrary combinations of inputs and it is thus a highlyflexible density function emulator of all possible input/output combinations.We illustrate our Transformer+Denoising Diffusion model by training it on alarge dataset of astronomical observations and measured labels of stars withinour Galaxy and we apply it to a variety of inference tasks to show that themodel can infer labels accurately with reasonable distributions.</description><author>Henry W.

However, this technological leap also brings significantchallenges, particularly for the dynamic and diverse IoV landscape, which mustmeet the rigorous reliability and security requirements of 6G networks.Furthermore, integrating 6G will likely increase the IoV's susceptibility to aspectrum of emerging cyber threats. Therefore, it is crucial for securitymechanisms to dynamically adapt and learn new attack patterns, keeping pacewith the rapid evolution and diversification of these threats - a capabilitycurrently lacking in existing systems. This paper presents a novel intrusiondetection system leveraging the paradigm of life-long (or continual) learning.Our methodology combines class-incremental learning with federated learning, anapproach ideally suited to the distributed nature of the IoV. This strategyeffectively harnesses the collective intelligence of Connected and AutomatedVehicles (CAVs) and edge computing capabilities to train the detection system.To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to synergizeclass-incremental learning with federated learning specifically for cyberattack detection. Through comprehensive experiments on a recent network trafficdataset, our system has exhibited a robust adaptability in learning new cyberattack patterns, while effectively retaining knowledge of previouslyencountered ones.

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks(PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. Thisframework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model thatminimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditionalneural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inferencelearning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patternsof neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been morecomputationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that itcan achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization.Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditionalfeedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range oftrainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latentvariable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervisedlearning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditionalartificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review anddetailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within thecontext of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library(PRECO) for practical implementation.

Variational inference and Markov chain MonteCarlo methods are the predominant tools for this task; however, both methodsare often challenging to apply reliably, particularly when the posterior hascomplex geometry. Here, we introduce Soft Contrastive Variational Inference(SoftCVI), which allows a family of variational objectives to be derivedthrough a contrastive estimation framework. These objectives have zero variancegradient when the variational approximation is exact, without the need forspecialized gradient estimators. The approach involves parameterizing aclassifier in terms of the variational distribution, which allows the inferencetask to be reframed as a contrastive estimation problem, aiming to identify asingle true posterior sample among a set of samples. Despite this framing, wedo not require positive or negative samples, but rather learn by sampling thevariational distribution and computing ground truth soft classification labelsfrom the unnormalized posterior itself. We empirically investigate theperformance on a variety of Bayesian inference tasks, using both using bothsimple (e.g. normal) and expressive (normalizing flow) variationaldistributions. We find that SoftCVI objectives often outperform other commonlyused variational objectives.</description><author>Daniel Ward, Mark Beaumont, Matteo Fasiolo</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 14:54:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15687v1</guid></item></channel></rss>

First, forstronger vision-language alignment, we unfreeze the large language model (LLM)during pre-training, and introduce a weight mix strategy between LLMs trainedby real-world and synthetic data. By directly integrating the weights from twodomains, the mixed LLM can efficiently incorporate diverse semantics withfavorable robustness. Then, to enable multi-purpose capabilities, we mix avariety of tasks for joint visual instruction tuning, and design task-specificinstructions to avoid inter-task conflict. In addition to the basic visualquestion answering, we include more challenging tasks such as region-levelunderstanding, caption grounding, document layout detection, and human poseestimation, contributing to mutual enhancement over different scenarios.Additionally, we propose to extract comprehensive visual embeddings fromvarious network architectures, pre-training paradigms, and informationgranularity, providing language models with more robust image representations.Based on our proposed joint mixing, SPHINX exhibits superior multi-modalunderstanding capabilities on a wide range of applications. On top of this, wefurther propose an efficient strategy aiming to better capture fine-grainedappearances of high-resolution images. With a mixing of different scales andhigh-resolution sub-images, SPHINX attains exceptional visual parsing andreasoning performance on existing evaluation benchmarks. We hope our work maycast a light on the exploration of joint mixing in future MLLM research.

Furthermore, theinstructions might even contradict the visual content without observing theentire visual context. To address this challenge, we introduce a fine-grainedvisual instruction dataset, LVIS-Instruct4V, which contains 220K visuallyaligned and context-aware instructions produced by prompting the powerfulGPT-4V with images from LVIS. Through experimental validation and case studies,we demonstrate that high-quality visual instructional data could improve theperformance of LLaVA-1.5, a state-of-the-art large multimodal model, across awide spectrum of benchmarks by clear margins. Notably, by simply replacing theLLaVA-Instruct with our LVIS-Instruct4V, we achieve better results than LLaVAon most challenging LMM benchmarks, e.g., LLaVA$^w$ (76.7 vs. 70.7) and MM-Vet(40.2 vs. 35.4).

While there have beensignificant recent strides in some cases towards understanding how neuralnetworks implement specific target functions, this paper explores acomplementary question -- why do networks arrive at particular computationalstrategies? Our inquiry focuses on the algebraic learning tasks of modularaddition, sparse parities, and finite group operations. Our primary theoreticalfindings analytically characterize the features learned by stylized neuralnetworks for these algebraic tasks. Notably, our main technique demonstrateshow the principle of margin maximization alone can be used to fully specify thefeatures learned by the network. Specifically, we prove that the trainednetworks utilize Fourier features to perform modular addition and employfeatures corresponding to irreducible group-theoretic representations toperform compositions in general groups, aligning closely with the empiricalobservations of Nanda et al. and Chughtai et al. More generally, we hope ourtechniques can help to foster a deeper understanding of why neural networksadopt specific computational strategies.</description><author>Depen Morwani, Benjamin L.

During a typical free-breathing DCE-CMRI scan, close to 300time-resolved images of myocardial perfusion are acquired at various contrast"wash in/out" phases. Manual segmentation of myocardial contours in eachtime-frame of a DCE image series can be tedious and time-consuming,particularly when non-rigid motion correction has failed or is unavailable.While deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown promise for analyzing DCE-CMRIdatasets, a "dynamic quality control" (dQC) technique for reliably detectingfailed segmentations is lacking. Here we propose a new space-time uncertaintymetric as a dQC tool for DNN-based segmentation of free-breathing DCE-CMRIdatasets by validating the proposed metric on an external dataset andestablishing a human-in-the-loop framework to improve the segmentation results.In the proposed approach, we referred the top 10% most uncertain segmentationsas detected by our dQC tool to the human expert for refinement. This approachresulted in a significant increase in the Dice score (p&lt;0.001) and a notabledecrease in the number of images with failed segmentation (16.2% to 11.3%)whereas the alternative approach of randomly selecting the same number ofsegmentations for human referral did not achieve any significant improvement.Our results suggest that the proposed dQC framework has the potential toaccurately identify poor-quality segmentations and may enable efficientDNN-based analysis of DCE-CMRI in a human-in-the-loop pipeline for clinicalinterpretation and reporting of dynamic CMRI datasets.</description><author>Dilek M.

We show that, for the case of generalised linearbandits, EVILL reduces to perturbed history exploration (PHE), a method whereexploration is done by training on randomly perturbed rewards. In doing so, weprovide a simple and clean explanation of when and why random rewardperturbations give rise to good bandit algorithms. With the data-dependentperturbations we propose, not present in previous PHE-type methods, EVILL isshown to match the performance of Thompson-sampling-styleparameter-perturbation methods, both in theory and in practice.

In this paper, we explore the attribution of transcribedspeech, which poses novel challenges. The main challenge is that many stylisticfeatures, such as punctuation and capitalization, are not available orreliable. Therefore, we expect a priori that transcribed speech is a morechallenging domain for attribution. On the other hand, other stylisticfeatures, such as speech disfluencies, may enable more successful attributionbut, being specific to speech, require special purpose models. To betterunderstand the challenges of this setting, we contribute the first systematicstudy of speaker attribution based solely on transcribed speech. Specifically,we propose a new benchmark for speaker attribution focused on conversationalspeech transcripts. To control for spurious associations of speakers withtopic, we employ both conversation prompts and speakers' participating in thesame conversation to construct challenging verification trials of varyingdifficulties. We establish the state of the art on this new benchmark bycomparing a suite of neural and non-neural baselines, finding that althoughwritten text attribution models achieve surprisingly good performance incertain settings, they struggle in the hardest settings we consider.</description><author>Cristina Aggazzotti, Nicholas Andrews, Elizabeth Allyn Smith</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 18:54:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07564v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning Control Policies of Hodgkin-Huxley Neuronal Dynamics</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07563v1</link><description>We present a neural network approach for closed-loop deep brain stimulation(DBS).

In this setting, control policies aim to optimize therapeuticoutcomes by tailoring the parameters of a DBS system, typically via electricalstimulation, in real time based on the patient's ongoing neuronal activity. Weapproximate the value function offline using a neural network to enablegenerating controls (stimuli) in real time via the feedback form. The neuronalactivity is characterized by a nonlinear, stiff system of differentialequations as dictated by the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

When it is computed in Fourier space, it can handleefficiently template translations but it cannot do so with template rotations.Including rotations requires sampling the whole space of rotations, repeatingthe computation of the correlation each time. This article develops an alternative mathematical theory to handleefficiently, at the same time, rotations and translations. Our proposal has areduced computational complexity because it does not require to repeatedlysample the space of rotations. To do so, we integrate the information relativeto all rotated versions of the template into a unique symmetric tensor template-which is computed only once per template-. Afterward, we demonstrate that thecorrelation between the image to be processed with the independent tensorcomponents of the tensorial template contains enough information to recovertemplate instance positions and rotations. Our proposed method has the potential to speed up conventional templatematching computations by a factor of several magnitude orders for the case of3D images.</description><author>Jos√© Mar√≠a Almira, Harold Phelippeau, Antonio Martinez-Sanchez</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 18:53:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07561v1</guid></item><item><title>Data-Efficient Task Generalization via Probabilistic Model-based Meta Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07558v1</link><description>We introduce PACOH-RL, a novel model-based Meta-Reinforcement Learning(Meta-RL) algorithm designed to efficiently adapt control policies to changingdynamics. PACOH-RL meta-learns priors for the dynamics model, allowing swiftadaptation to new dynamics with minimal interaction data. Existing Meta-RLmethods require abundant meta-learning data, limiting their applicability insettings such as robotics, where data is costly to obtain. To address this,PACOH-RL incorporates regularization and epistemic uncertainty quantificationin both the meta-learning and task adaptation stages. When facing new dynamics,we use these uncertainty estimates to effectively guide exploration and datacollection. Overall, this enables positive transfer, even when access to datafrom prior tasks or dynamic settings is severely limited. Our experimentresults demonstrate that PACOH-RL outperforms model-based RL and model-basedMeta-RL baselines in adapting to new dynamic conditions. Finally, on a realrobotic car, we showcase the potential for efficient RL policy adaptation indiverse, data-scarce conditions.</description><author>Arjun Bhardwaj, Jonas Rothfuss, Bhavya Sukhija, Yarden As, Marco Hutter, Stelian Coros, Andreas Krause</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 18:51:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07558v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning to Generate Better Than Your LLM</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11816v2</link><description>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm forfine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for text generation. In particular,recent LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 can engage in fluent conversations withusers after finetuning with RL. Capitalizing on key properties of textgeneration, we seek to investigate RL algorithms beyond general purposealgorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In particular, we extend RLalgorithms to allow them to interact with a dynamic black-box guide LLM andpropose RL with guided feedback (RLGF), a suite of RL algorithms for LLMfine-tuning. We provide two ways for the guide LLM to interact with the LLM tobe optimized for maximizing rewards. The guide LLM can generate text whichserves as additional starting states for the RL optimization procedure. Theguide LLM can also be used to complete the partial sentences generated by theLLM that is being optimized, treating the guide LLM as an expert to imitate andsurpass eventually. We experiment on the IMDB positive sentiment, CommonGen,and TL;DR summarization tasks. We show that our RL algorithms achieve higherperformance than supervised learning (SL) and the RL baseline PPO,demonstrating the benefit of interaction with the guide LLM. On both CommonGenand TL;DR, we not only outperform our SL baselines but also improve upon PPOacross a variety of metrics beyond the one we optimized for.

However, the existing literature shows that ICLencounters performance deterioration when exposed to adversarial inputs.Enhanced performance has been observed when ICL is augmented with naturallanguage explanations (NLEs) (we refer to it as X-ICL). Thus, this workinvestigates whether X-ICL can improve the robustness of LLMs on a suite ofseven adversarial and challenging natural language inference datasets.Moreover, we introduce a new approach to X-ICL by prompting an LLM (ChatGPT inour case) with few human-generated NLEs to produce further NLEs (we call itChatGPT few-shot), which we show superior to both ChatGPT zero-shot andhuman-generated NLEs alone. We evaluate five popular LLMs (GPT3.5-turbo,LLaMa2, Vicuna, Zephyr, Mistral) and show that X-ICL with ChatGPT few-shotyields over 6% improvement over ICL. Furthermore, while prompt selectionstrategies were previously shown to significantly improve ICL onin-distribution test sets, we show that these strategies do not match theefficacy of the X-ICL paradigm in robustness-oriented evaluations.</description><author>Xuanli He, Yuxiang Wu, Oana-Maria Camburu, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 18:49:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07556v1</guid></item><item><title>An Extensive Study on Adversarial Attack against Pre-trained Models of Code</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07553v1</link><description>Transformer-based pre-trained models of code (PTMC) have been widely utilizedand have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many mission-criticalapplications. However, they can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks throughidentifier substitution or coding style transformation, which can significantlydegrade accuracy and may further incur security concerns. Although severalapproaches have been proposed to generate adversarial examples for PTMC, theeffectiveness and efficiency of such approaches, especially on different codeintelligence tasks, has not been well understood. To bridge this gap, thisstudy systematically analyzes five state-of-the-art adversarial attackapproaches from three perspectives: effectiveness, efficiency, and the qualityof generated examples. The results show that none of the five approachesbalances all these perspectives. Particularly, approaches with a high attacksuccess rate tend to be time-consuming; the adversarial code they generateoften lack naturalness, and vice versa. To address this limitation, we explorethe impact of perturbing identifiers under different contexts and find thatidentifier substitution within for and if statements is the most effective.Based on these findings, we propose a new approach that prioritizes differenttypes of statements for various tasks and further utilizes beam search togenerate adversarial examples. Evaluation results show that it outperforms thestate-of-the-art ALERT in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency whilepreserving the naturalness of the generated adversarial examples.</description><author>Xiaohu Du, Ming Wen, Zichao Wei, Shangwen Wang, Hai Jin</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 18:48:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07553v1</guid></item><item><title>Ghostbuster: Detecting Text Ghostwritten by Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15047v2</link><description>We introduce Ghostbuster, a state-of-the-art system for detectingAI-generated text. Our method works by passing documents through a series ofweaker language models, running a structured search over possible combinationsof their features, and then training a classifier on the selected features topredict whether documents are AI-generated. Crucially, Ghostbuster does notrequire access to token probabilities from the target model, making it usefulfor detecting text generated by black-box models or unknown model versions.

We compare Ghostbuster to a variety ofexisting detectors, including DetectGPT and GPTZero, as well as a new RoBERTabaseline. Ghostbuster achieves 99.0 F1 when evaluated across domains, which is5.9 F1 higher than the best preexisting model. It also outperforms all previousapproaches in generalization across writing domains (+7.5 F1), promptingstrategies (+2.1 F1), and language models (+4.4 F1).

Ourapproach equips a robotic agent with a self-guided propose-generate-learncycle: the agent first proposes interesting tasks and skills to develop, andthen generates corresponding simulation environments by populating pertinentobjects and assets with proper spatial configurations. Afterwards, the agentdecomposes the proposed high-level task into sub-tasks, selects the optimallearning approach (reinforcement learning, motion planning, or trajectoryoptimization), generates required training supervision, and then learnspolicies to acquire the proposed skill.

These attacks involve thesubtle insertion of triggers during model training, allowing for manipulatedpredictions. More recently, DNNs for tabular data have gained increasingattention due to the rise of transformer models. Our research presents a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on tabulardata using DNNs, particularly focusing on transformer-based networks. Given theinherent complexities of tabular data, we explore the challenges of embeddingbackdoors. Through systematic experimentation across benchmark datasets, weuncover that transformer-based DNNs for tabular data are highly susceptible tobackdoor attacks, even with minimal feature value alterations.

The goal of this work is to introduce aninterpretable fine-tuning strategy for GNNs, with application to unstructuredmesh-based fluid dynamics modeling. The end result is a fine-tuned GNN thatadds interpretability to a pre-trained baseline GNN through an adaptivesub-graph sampling strategy that isolates regions in physical spaceintrinsically linked to the forecasting task, while retaining the predictivecapability of the baseline. The structures identified by the fine-tuned GNNs,which are adaptively produced in the forward pass as explicit functions of theinput, serve as an accessible link between the baseline model architecture, theoptimization goal, and known problem-specific physics. Additionally, through aregularization procedure, the fine-tuned GNNs can also be used to identify,during inference, graph nodes that correspond to a majority of the anticipatedforecasting error, adding a novel interpretable error-tagging capability tobaseline models.

Understanding social multimedia content remains a challengingproblem for contemporary machine learning frameworks. In this paper, we exploreGPT-4V(ision)'s capabilities for social multimedia analysis. We select fiverepresentative tasks, including sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, fakenews identification, demographic inference, and political ideology detection,to evaluate GPT-4V. Our investigation begins with a preliminary quantitativeanalysis for each task using existing benchmark datasets, followed by a carefulreview of the results and a selection of qualitative samples that illustrateGPT-4V's potential in understanding multimodal social media content. GPT-4Vdemonstrates remarkable efficacy in these tasks, showcasing strengths such asjoint understanding of image-text pairs, contextual and cultural awareness, andextensive commonsense knowledge. Despite the overall impressive capacity ofGPT-4V in the social media domain, there remain notable challenges. GPT-4Vstruggles with tasks involving multilingual social multimedia comprehension andhas difficulties in generalizing to the latest trends in social media.Additionally, it exhibits a tendency to generate erroneous information in thecontext of evolving celebrity and politician knowledge, reflecting the knownhallucination problem.

In the original formulation, simplicial models werealways assumed to be pure, meaning that all worlds have the same dimension.This is equivalent to the standard S5n semantics of epistemic logic, based onKripke models. By removing the assumption that models must be pure, we can gobeyond the usual Kripke semantics and study epistemic logics where the numberof agents participating in a world can vary. This approach has been developedin a number of papers, with applications in fault-tolerant distributedcomputing where processes may crash during the execution of a system. Adifficulty that arises is that subtle design choices in the definition ofimpure simplicial models can result in different axioms of the resulting logic.In this paper, we classify those design choices systematically, and axiomatizethe corresponding logics.

Menon etal., 2022). While these classifiers can generalize in zero-shot settings, theirtask performance often varies substantially between different languageexplanations in unpredictable ways (Lu et al., 2022; Gonen et al., 2022). Also,current approaches fail to leverage unlabeled examples that may be available inmany scenarios. Here, we introduce TALC, a framework that uses data programmingto adapt a language-guided classifier for a new task during inference whenprovided with explanations from multiple teachers and unlabeled test examples.Our results show that TALC consistently outperforms a competitive baseline fromprior work by an impressive 9.3% (relative improvement). Further, wedemonstrate the robustness of TALC to variations in the quality and quantity ofprovided explanations, highlighting its potential in scenarios where learningfrom multiple teachers or a crowd is involved.

Wethen use this benchmark to study and improve the generalization ability ofscientific document representation models. We show how state-of-the-art modelslike SPECTER and SciNCL struggle to generalize across the task formats, andthat simple multi-task training fails to improve them.

To do so, the music needs to be tokenized,i.e. converted into a sequence of discrete tokens. This can be achieved bydifferent approaches, as music can be composed of simultaneous tracks, ofsimultaneous notes with several attributes. Until now, the proposedtokenizations rely on small vocabularies of tokens describing the noteattributes and time events, resulting in fairly long token sequences, and asub-optimal use of the embedding space of language models. Recent research hasput efforts on reducing the overall sequence length by merging embeddings orcombining tokens. In this paper, we show that Byte Pair Encoding, a compressiontechnique widely used for natural language, significantly decreases thesequence length while increasing the vocabulary size. By doing so, we leveragethe embedding capabilities of such models with more expressive tokens,resulting in both better results and faster inference in generation andclassification tasks.

The recent deep feature reweighting (DFR) technique achievesstate-of-the-art group robustness via simple last-layer retraining, but itrequires held-out group and class annotations to construct a group-balancedreweighting dataset. In this work, we examine this impractical requirement andfind that last-layer retraining can be surprisingly effective with no groupannotations (other than for model selection) and only a handful of classannotations. We first show that last-layer retraining can greatly improveworst-group accuracy even when the reweighting dataset has only a smallproportion of worst-group data. This implies a "free lunch" where holding out asubset of training data to retrain the last layer can substantially outperformERM on the entire dataset with no additional data or annotations. To furtherimprove group robustness, we introduce a lightweight method called selectivelast-layer finetuning (SELF), which constructs the reweighting dataset usingmisclassifications or disagreements. Our empirical and theoretical resultspresent the first evidence that model disagreement upsamples worst-group data,enabling SELF to nearly match DFR on four well-established benchmarks acrossvision and language tasks with no group annotations and less than 3% of theheld-out class annotations.

However, continuous monitoring based onoptical satellite data can be hampered by atmospheric effects such as clouds.On the contrary, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can offer insightful andsystematic forest monitoring with complete time series due to signalpenetration through clouds and day and night acquisitions. The goal of thiswork is to overcome the issues affecting optical data with SAR data and serveas a substitute for estimating optical VIs for forests using machine learning.Time series of four VIs (LAI, FAPAR, EVI and NDVI) were estimated usingmultitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR and ancillary data. This was enabled by creating apaired multi-temporal and multi-modal dataset in Google Earth Engine (GEE),including temporally and spatially aligned Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, digitalelevation model (DEM), weather and land cover datasets (MMT-GEE). The use ofancillary features generated from DEM and weather data improved the results.The open-source Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML) approach, auto-sklearn,outperformed Random Forest Regression for three out of four VIs, while a 1-houroptimization length was enough to achieve sufficient results with an R2 of69-84% low errors (0.05-0.32 of MAE depending on VI). Great agreement was alsofound for selected case studies in the time series analysis and in the spatialcomparison between the original and estimated SAR-based VIs. In general,compared to VIs from currently freely available optical satellite data andavailable global VI products, a better temporal resolution (up to 240measurements/year) and a better spatial resolution (20 m) were achieved usingestimated SAR-based VIs. A great advantage of the SAR-based VI is the abilityto detect abrupt forest changes with a sub-weekly temporal accuracy.</description><author>Daniel Paluba, Bertrand Le Saux, Francesco Sarti, P≈ôemysl Stych</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 18:23:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07537v1</guid></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Evaluation of GPT-4V on Knowledge-Intensive Visual Question Answering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07536v1</link><description>The emergence of multimodal large models (MLMs) has significantly advancedthe field of visual understanding, offering remarkable capabilities in therealm of visual question answering (VQA). Yet, the true challenge lies in thedomain of knowledge-intensive VQA tasks, which necessitate not just recognitionof visual elements, but also a deep comprehension of the visual information inconjunction with a vast repository of learned knowledge. To uncover suchcapabilities of MLMs, particularly the newly introduced GPT-4V, we provide anin-depth evaluation from three perspectives: 1) Commonsense Knowledge, whichassesses how well models can understand visual cues and connect to generalknowledge; 2) Fine-grained World Knowledge, which tests the model's skill inreasoning out specific knowledge from images, showcasing their proficiencyacross various specialized fields; 3) Comprehensive Knowledge withDecision-making Rationales, which examines model's capability to providelogical explanations for its inference, facilitating a deeper analysis from theinterpretability perspective. Extensive experiments indicate that GPT-4Vachieves SOTA performance on above three tasks. Interestingly, we find that: a)GPT-4V demonstrates enhanced reasoning and explanation when using compositeimages as few-shot; b) GPT-4V produces severe hallucinations when dealing withworld knowledge, highlighting the future need for advancements in this researchdirection.</description><author>Yunxin Li, Longyue Wang, Baotian Hu, Xinyu Chen, Wanqi Zhong, Chenyang Lyu, Min Zhang</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 18:22:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07536v1</guid></item><item><title>Comprehensive Comparison of Deep Learning Models for Lung and COVID-19 Lesion Segmentation in CT scans</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06412v7</link><description>Recently there has been an explosion in the use of Deep Learning (DL) methodsfor medical image segmentation. However the field's reliability is hindered bythe lack of a common base of reference for accuracy/performance evaluation andthe fact that previous research uses different datasets for evaluation. In thispaper, an extensive comparison of DL models for lung and COVID-19 lesionsegmentation in Computerized Tomography (CT) scans is presented, which can alsobe used as a benchmark for testing medical image segmentation models. Four DLarchitectures (Unet, Linknet, FPN, PSPNet) are combined with 25 randomlyinitialized and pretrained encoders (variations of VGG, DenseNet, ResNet,ResNext, DPN, MobileNet, Xception, Inception-v4, EfficientNet), to construct200 tested models. Three experimental setups are conducted for lungsegmentation, lesion segmentation and lesion segmentation using the originallung masks. A public COVID-19 dataset with 100 CT scan images (80 for train, 20for validation) is used for training/validation and a different public datasetconsisting of 829 images from 9 CT scan volumes for testing. Multiple findingsare provided including the best architecture-encoder models for each experimentas well as mean Dice results for each experiment, architecture and encoderindependently. Finally, the upper bounds improvements when using lung masks asa preprocessing step or when using pretrained models are quantified.

Despiteconsiderable research in the physical and natural sciences, the empirical studyof this phenomenon in societal systems is relatively underdeveloped. The goalof this study is to explore whether the dynamics of collective civil unrest canbe plausibly characterized as a sequence of recurrent phase shifts, with eachphase having measurable and identifiable latent characteristics. Building onprevious efforts to characterize civil unrest as a self-organized criticalsystem, we introduce a macro-level statistical model of civil unrest andevaluate its plausibility using a comprehensive dataset of civil unrest eventsin 170 countries from 1946 to 2017. Our findings demonstrate that themacro-level phase model effectively captures the characteristics of civilunrest data from diverse countries globally and that universal mechanisms mayunderlie certain aspects of the dynamics of civil unrest. We also introduce ascale to quantify a country's long-term unrest per unit of time and show thatcivil unrest events tend to cluster geographically, with the magnitude of civilunrest concentrated in specific regions. Our approach has the potential toidentify and measure phase transitions in various collective human phenomenabeyond civil unrest, contributing to a better understanding of complex socialsystems.</description><author>Dan Braha</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 18:19:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08698v3</guid></item><item><title>It's Not Easy Being Wrong: Evaluating Process of Elimination Reasoning in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07532v1</link><description>Chain-of-thought (COT) prompting can help large language models (LLMs) reasontoward correct answers, but its efficacy in reasoning toward incorrect answersis unexplored.

The patterns learned are often used in transportation research areas suchas eco-driving, road safety, and intelligent vehicles. One such model capableof modeling these patterns is the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process HiddenSemi-Markov Model (HDP-HSMM), as it is often used to estimate datasegmentation, state duration, and transition probabilities. While this model isa powerful tool for automatically clustering observed sequential data, theexisting HDP-HSMM estimation suffers from an inherent tendency to overestimatethe number of states. This can result in poor estimation, which can potentiallyimpact impact transportation research through incorrect inference of drivingpatterns. In this paper, a new robust HDP-HSMM (rHDP-HSMM) method is proposedto reduce the number of redundant states and improve the consistency of themodel's estimation. Both a simulation study and a case study using naturalisticdriving data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposedrHDP-HSMM in identifying and inference of driving maneuver patterns.</description><author>Matthew Aguirre, Wenbo Sun, Jionghua, Jin, Yang Chen</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 18:13:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07527v1</guid></item><item><title>A Step Towards Worldwide Biodiversity Assessment: The BIOSCAN-1M Insect Dataset</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10455v3</link><description>In an effort to catalog insect biodiversity, we propose a new large datasetof hand-labelled insect images, the BIOSCAN-Insect Dataset.

Here, we study an aspect of model epistemology: howepistemic markers of certainty, uncertainty, or evidentiality like "I'm sureit's", "I think it's", or "Wikipedia says it's" affect models, and whether theycontribute to model failures. We develop a typology of epistemic markers andinject 50 markers into prompts for question answering. We find that LMs arehighly sensitive to epistemic markers in prompts, with accuracies varying morethan 80%. Surprisingly, we find that expressions of high certainty result in a7% decrease in accuracy as compared to low certainty expressions; similarly,factive verbs hurt performance, while evidentials benefit performance. Ouranalysis of a popular pretraining dataset shows that these markers ofuncertainty are associated with answers on question-answering websites, whilemarkers of certainty are associated with questions. These associations maysuggest that the behavior of LMs is based on mimicking observed language use,rather than truly reflecting epistemic uncertainty.</description><author>Kaitlyn Zhou, Dan Jurafsky, Tatsunori Hashimoto</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 18:10:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13439v2</guid></item><item><title>Machine Learning For Beamline Steering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07519v1</link><description>Beam steering is the process involving the calibration of the angle andposition at which a particle accelerator's electron beam is incident upon thex-ray target with respect to the rotation axis of the collimator.

It is essential for TBPS to extractfine-grained local features and align them crossing modality. Existing methodsutilize external tools or heavy cross-modal interaction to achieve explicitalignment of cross-modal fine-grained features, which is inefficient andtime-consuming. In this work, we propose a Vision-Guided Semantic-Group Network(VGSG) for text-based person search to extract well-aligned fine-grained visualand textual features. In the proposed VGSG, we develop a Semantic-Group TextualLearning (SGTL) module and a Vision-guided Knowledge Transfer (VGKT) module toextract textual local features under the guidance of visual local clues. InSGTL, in order to obtain the local textual representation, we group textualfeatures from the channel dimension based on the semantic cues of languageexpression, which encourages similar semantic patterns to be grouped implicitlywithout external tools. In VGKT, a vision-guided attention is employed toextract visual-related textual features, which are inherently aligned withvisual cues and termed vision-guided textual features. Furthermore, we design arelational knowledge transfer, including a vision-language similarity transferand a class probability transfer, to adaptively propagate information of thevision-guided textual features to semantic-group textual features. With thehelp of relational knowledge transfer, VGKT is capable of aligningsemantic-group textual features with corresponding visual features withoutexternal tools and complex pairwise interaction.

This has led to the rise of eXplainableArtificial Intelligence (XAI) methods aimed at creating models that are easilyunderstood by humans. Classical XAI methods, such as LIME and SHAP, have beendeveloped to provide explanations for complex models. While these methods havemade significant contributions, they also have limitations, includingcomputational complexity, inherent model bias, sensitivity to data sampling,and challenges in dealing with feature dependence. In this context, this paperexplores good practices for deploying explainability in AI-based systems forfinance, emphasising the importance of data quality, audience-specific methods,consideration of data properties, and the stability of explanations.

Furthermore, the benefits thatmachine learning can bring to the task of providing such estimates have notbeen broadly realized and properly explored through benchmark experiments. Thepresent study aims at filling in this specific gap by conducting the firstbenchmark tests on the topic. On a large dataset that comprises 15-year-longmonthly data spanning across the contiguous United States, we extensivelycompared six learners that are, by their construction, appropriate forpredictive uncertainty quantification.

Additionally, the potential of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) toenhance LLM-based question answering by providing business context is not wellunderstood. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of LLM-powered questionanswering systems in the context of enterprise questions and SQL databases,while also exploring the role of knowledge graphs in improving accuracy. Toachieve this, we introduce a benchmark comprising an enterprise SQL schema inthe insurance domain, a range of enterprise queries encompassing reporting tometrics, and a contextual layer incorporating an ontology and mappings thatdefine a knowledge graph. Our primary finding reveals that question answeringusing GPT-4, with zero-shot prompts directly on SQL databases, achieves anaccuracy of 16%.

Common oversampling techniques such as SMOTE rely on localinformation and can introduce marginalization issues.

To this end, we propose STEM, which combines SMOTE-ENNand Mixup at the instance level. This integration enables us to effectivelyleverage the entire distribution of minority classes, thereby mitigating bothbetween-class and within-class imbalances. We focus on the breast cancerproblem, where imbalanced datasets are prevalent. The results demonstrate theeffectiveness of STEM, which achieves AUC values of 0.96 and 0.99 in theDigital Database for Screening Mammography and Wisconsin Breast Cancer(Diagnostics) datasets, respectively.

Inthis paper, we propose a computationally efficient alternative for optimizingneural networks that can both reduce the costs of scaling neural networks andprovide high-efficiency optimizations for low-resource applications. We derivean explicit solution to a simple feed-forward language model (LM) bymathematically analyzing its gradients. This solution generalizes fromsingle-layer LMs to the class of all single-layer feed-forwardsoftmax-activated neural models trained on positive-valued features, as isdemonstrated by our extension of this solution application to MNIST digitclassification. For both LM and digit classifiers, we find computationally thatexplicit solutions perform near-optimality in experiments showing that 1)iterative optimization only marginally improves the explicit solutionparameters and 2) randomly initialized parameters iteratively optimize towardsthe explicit solution. We also preliminarily apply the explicit solutionlocally by layer in multi-layer networks and discuss how the solution'scomputational savings increase with model complexity -- for both single- andmult-layer applications of the explicit solution, we emphasize that the optimaachieved cannot be reached by backpropagation alone, i.e., better optima appeardiscoverable only after explicit solutions are applied. Finally, we discuss thesolution's computational savings alongside its impact on model interpretabilityand suggest future directions for the derivation of explicit solutions tocomplex- and multi-layer architectures.</description><author>Jake Ryland Williams, Haoran Zhao</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 17:38:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07498v1</guid></item><item><title>Multilingual Nonce Dependency Treebanks: Understanding how LLMs represent and process syntactic structure</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07497v1</link><description>We introduce SPUD (Semantically Perturbed Universal Dependencies), aframework for creating nonce treebanks for the multilingual UniversalDependencies (UD) corpora.

However, its broad adoption is hinderedby the high communication costs of transmitting a large number of modelparameters. This paper presents EvoFed, a novel approach that integratesEvolutionary Strategies (ES) with FL to address these challenges. EvoFedemploys a concept of 'fitness-based information sharing', deviatingsignificantly from the conventional model-based FL. Rather than exchanging theactual updated model parameters, each node transmits a distance-basedsimilarity measure between the locally updated model and each member of thenoise-perturbed model population. Each node, as well as the server, generatesan identical population set of perturbed models in a completely synchronizedfashion using the same random seeds. With properly chosen noise variance andpopulation size, perturbed models can be combined to closely reflect the actualmodel updated using the local dataset, allowing the transmitted similaritymeasures (or fitness values) to carry nearly the complete information about themodel parameters. As the population size is typically much smaller than thenumber of model parameters, the savings in communication load is large. Theserver aggregates these fitness values and is able to update the global model.This global fitness vector is then disseminated back to the nodes, each ofwhich applies the same update to be synchronized to the global model. Ouranalysis shows that EvoFed converges, and our experimental results validatethat at the cost of increased local processing loads, EvoFed achievesperformance comparable to FedAvg while reducing overall communicationrequirements drastically in various practical settings.</description><author>Mohammad Mahdi Rahimi, Hasnain Irshad Bhatti, Younghyun Park, Humaira Kousar, Jaekyun Moon</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 17:25:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07485v1</guid></item><item><title>Semantic segmentation of sparse irregular point clouds for leaf/wood discrimination</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16963v2</link><description>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) has become an essential part of theremote sensing toolbox used for biosphere monitoring. In particular, LiDARprovides the opportunity to map forest leaf area with unprecedented accuracy,while leaf area has remained an important source of uncertainty affectingmodels of gas exchanges between the vegetation and the atmosphere. UnmannedAerial Vehicles (UAV) are easy to mobilize and therefore allow frequentrevisits to track the response of vegetation to climate change. However,miniature sensors embarked on UAVs usually provide point clouds of limiteddensity, which are further affected by a strong decrease in density from top tobottom of the canopy due to progressively stronger occlusion. In such acontext, discriminating leaf points from wood points presents a significantchallenge due in particular to strong class imbalance and spatially irregularsampling intensity. Here we introduce a neural network model based on thePointnet ++ architecture which makes use of point geometry only (excluding anyspectral information). To cope with local data sparsity, we propose aninnovative sampling scheme which strives to preserve local important geometricinformation. We also propose a loss function adapted to the severe classimbalance. We show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives onUAV point clouds.

An Analysis and Mitigation of the Reversal Curse</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07468v1</link><description>Recent studies have highlighted a phenomenon in large language models (LLMs)known as "the reversal curse," in which the order of knowledge entities in thetraining data biases the models' comprehension. For example, if a model istrained on sentences where entity A consistently appears before entity B, itcan respond to queries about A by providing B. However, it may encounterconfusion when presented with questions concerning B. We contend that thereversal curse is partially a result of specific model training objectives,particularly evident in the prevalent use of the next-token prediction withinmost causal language models. For the next-token prediction, models solely focuson a token's preceding context, resulting in a restricted comprehension of theinput. In contrast, we illustrate that the GLM, trained using theautoregressive blank infilling objective where tokens to be predicted haveaccess to the entire context, exhibits better resilience against the reversalcurse. We propose a novel training method, BIdirectional Casual languagemodeling Optimization (BICO), designed to mitigate the reversal curse whenfine-tuning pretrained causal language models on new data. BICO modifies thecausal attention mechanism to function bidirectionally and employs a maskdenoising optimization. In the task designed to assess the reversal curse, ourapproach improves Llama's accuracy from the original 0% to around 70%. We hopethat more attention can be focused on exploring and addressing these inherentweaknesses of the current LLMs, in order to achieve a higher level ofintelligence.</description><author>Ang Lv, Kaiyi Zhang, Shufang Xie, Quan Tu, Yuhan Chen, Ji-Rong Wen, Rui Yan</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 17:01:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07468v1</guid></item><item><title>Summon a Demon and Bind it: A Grounded Theory of LLM Red Teaming in the Wild</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06237v2</link><description>Engaging in the deliberate generation of abnormal outputs from large languagemodels (LLMs) by attacking them is a novel human activity.

Due to the heterogeneous nature of local datasets, updated clientmodels may overfit and diverge from one another, commonly known as the problemof client drift. In this paper, we propose FedBug (Federated Learning withBottom-Up Gradual Unfreezing), a novel FL framework designed to effectivelymitigate client drift. FedBug adaptively leverages the client model parameters,distributed by the server at each global round, as the reference points forcross-client alignment. Specifically, on the client side, FedBug begins byfreezing the entire model, then gradually unfreezes the layers, from the inputlayer to the output layer. This bottom-up approach allows models to train thenewly thawed layers to project data into a latent space, wherein the separatinghyperplanes remain consistent across all clients. We theoretically analyzeFedBug in a novel over-parameterization FL setup, revealing its superiorconvergence rate compared to FedAvg. Through comprehensive experiments,spanning various datasets, training conditions, and network architectures, wevalidate the efficacy of FedBug. Our contributions encompass a novel FLframework, theoretical analysis, and empirical validation, demonstrating thewide potential and applicability of FedBug.</description><author>Chia-Hsiang Kao, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 16:57:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10317v2</guid></item><item><title>On Measuring Faithfulness of Natural Language Explanations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07466v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) can explain their own predictions, throughpost-hoc or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations. However the LLM could make upreasonably sounding explanations that are unfaithful to its underlyingreasoning. Recent work has designed tests that aim to judge the faithfulness ofeither post-hoc or CoT explanations. In this paper we argue that existingfaithfulness tests are not actually measuring faithfulness in terms of themodels' inner workings, but only evaluate their self-consistency on the outputlevel. The aims of our work are two-fold. i) We aim to clarify the status ofexisting faithfulness tests in terms of model explainability, characterisingthem as self-consistency tests instead. This assessment we underline byconstructing a Comparative Consistency Bank for self-consistency tests that forthe first time compares existing tests on a common suite of 11 open-source LLMsand 5 datasets -- including ii) our own proposed self-consistency measureCC-SHAP. CC-SHAP is a new fine-grained measure (not test) of LLMself-consistency that compares a model's input contributions to answerprediction and generated explanation. With CC-SHAP, we aim to take a stepfurther towards measuring faithfulness with a more interpretable andfine-grained method.

In this article, we revisit itsmathematical formalism, and propose an innovative approach making use ofReproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Within this framework, the X-raytransform can be considered as a natural analogue of Euclidean projections. TheRKHS framework considerably simplifies projection image interpolation, andleads to an analogue of the celebrated representer theorem for the problem oftomographic reconstruction. It leads to methodology that is dimension-free andstands apart from conventional filtered back-projection techniques, as it doesnot hinge on the Fourier transform. It also allows us to establish sharpstability results at a genuinely functional level, but in the realistic settingwhere the data are discrete and noisy. The RKHS framework is amenable to anyreproducing kernel on a unit ball, affording a high level of generality. Whenthe kernel is chosen to be rotation-invariant, one can obtain explicit spectralrepresentations which elucidate the regularity structure of the associatedHilbert spaces, and one can also solve the reconstruction problem at the samecomputational cost as filtered back-projection.</description><author>Ho Yun, Victor M.

In parallel, modern neural densityestimators, such as normalizing flows, are becoming increasingly popular foruncertainty quantification, especially when both parameters and observationsare high-dimensional. However, parameter inference is an inverse problem andnot a prediction task; thus, an open challenge is to construct conditionallyvalid and precise confidence regions, with a guaranteed probability of coveringthe true parameters of the data-generating process, no matter what the(unknown) parameter values are, and without relying on large-sample theory.Many simulator-based inference (SBI) methods are indeed known to produce biasedor overly confident parameter regions, yielding misleading uncertaintyestimates. This paper presents WALDO, a novel method to construct confidenceregions with finite-sample conditional validity by leveraging predictionalgorithms or posterior estimators that are currently widely adopted in SBI.WALDO reframes the well-known Wald test statistic, and uses a computationallyefficient regression-based machinery for classical Neyman inversion ofhypothesis tests. We apply our method to a recent high-energy physics problem,where prediction with DNNs has previously led to estimates with predictionbias. We also illustrate how our approach can correct overly confidentposterior regions computed with normalizing flows.</description><author>Luca Masserano, Tommaso Dorigo, Rafael Izbicki, Mikael Kuusela, Ann B.

Consequently, there has been a surge in LLM evaluationresearch to comprehend the models' capabilities and limitations. However, muchof this research has been confined to the English language, leaving LLMbuilding and evaluation for non-English languages relatively unexplored. Therehas been an introduction of several new LLMs, necessitating their evaluation onnon-English languages. This study aims to expand our MEGA benchmarking suite byincluding six new datasets to form the MEGAVERSE benchmark. The benchmarkcomprises 22 datasets covering 81 languages, including low-resource Africanlanguages. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT4,PaLM2, and Llama2 on the MEGAVERSE datasets. Additionally, we include twomultimodal datasets in the benchmark and assess the performance of theLLaVa-v1.5 model. Our experiments suggest that GPT4 and PaLM2 outperform theLlama models on various tasks, notably on low-resource languages, with GPT4outperforming PaLM2 on more datasets than vice versa. However, issues such asdata contamination must be addressed to obtain an accurate assessment of LLMperformance on non-English languages.</description><author>Sanchit Ahuja, Divyanshu Aggarwal, Varun Gumma, Ishaan Watts, Ashutosh Sathe, Millicent Ochieng, Rishav Hada, Prachi Jain, Maxamed Axmed, Kalika Bali, Sunayana Sitaram</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 16:45:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07463v1</guid></item><item><title>On Self-Supervised Dynamic Incremental Regularised Adaptation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07461v1</link><description>In this paper, we overview a recent method for dynamic domain adaptationnamed DIRA, which relies on a few samples in addition to a regularisationapproach named elastic weight consolidation to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA)domain adaptation results.

This paper proposesa combined knowledge and data driven approach, KnowSafe, for the design ofsafety engines that can predict and mitigate safety hazards resulting fromsafety-critical malicious attacks or accidental faults targeting a CPScontroller. We integrate domain-specific knowledge of safety constraints andcontext-specific mitigation actions with machine learning (ML) techniques toestimate system trajectories in the far and near future, infer potentialhazards, and generate optimal corrective actions to keep the system safe.Experimental evaluation on two realistic closed-loop testbeds for artificialpancreas systems (APS) and a real-world clinical trial dataset for diabetestreatment demonstrates that KnowSafe outperforms the state-of-the-art byachieving higher accuracy in predicting system state trajectories and potentialhazards, a low false positive rate, and no false negatives. It also maintainsthe safe operation of the simulated APS despite faults or attacks withoutintroducing any new hazards, with a hazard mitigation success rate of 92.8%,which is at least 76% higher than solely rule-based (50.9%) and data-driven(52.7%) methods.</description><author>Xugui Zhou, Maxfield Kouzel, Chloe Smith, Homa Alemzadeh</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 16:43:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07460v1</guid></item><item><title>HyperMixer: An MLP-based Low Cost Alternative to Transformers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03691v3</link><description>Transformer-based architectures are the model of choice for natural languageunderstanding, but they come at a significant cost, as they have quadraticcomplexity in the input length, require a lot of training data, and can bedifficult to tune. In the pursuit of lower costs, we investigate simpleMLP-based architectures.

While remarkable progress has been achieved, existingworks on AQA assume that all the training data are visible for training in onetime, but do not enable continual learning on assessing new technical actions.In this work, we address such a Continual Learning problem in AQA(Continual-AQA), which urges a unified model to learn AQA tasks sequentiallywithout forgetting. Our idea for modeling Continual-AQA is to sequentiallylearn a task-consistent score-discriminative feature distribution, in which thelatent features express a strong correlation with the score labels regardlessof the task or action types. From this perspective, we aim to mitigate theforgetting in Continual-AQA from two aspects. Firstly, to fuse the features ofnew and previous data into a score-discriminative distribution, a novelFeature-Score Correlation-Aware Rehearsal is proposed to store and reuse datafrom previous tasks with limited memory size. Secondly, an ActionGeneral-Specific Graph is developed to learn and decouple the action-generaland action-specific knowledge so that the task-consistent score-discriminativefeatures can be better extracted across various tasks. Extensive experimentsare conducted to evaluate the contributions of proposed components. Thecomparisons with the existing continual learning methods additionally verifythe effectiveness and versatility of our approach.</description><author>Yuan-Ming Li, Ling-An Zeng, Jing-Ke Meng, Wei-Shi Zheng</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 16:37:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17105v2</guid></item><item><title>Causal Discovery under Latent Class Confounding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07454v1</link><description>Directed acyclic graphs are used to model the causal structure of a system.``Causal discovery'' describes the problem of learning this structure fromdata.

Wedemonstrate that, if the confounding is of bounded cardinality (i.e. the datacomes from a limited number of sources), causal discovery can still beachieved.

However, EBMs become readily less transparentand harder to interpret in high-dimensional settings with many predictorvariables; they also become more difficult to use in production due toincreases in scoring time. We propose a simple solution based on the leastabsolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) that can help introducesparsity by reweighting the individual model terms and removing the lessrelevant ones, thereby allowing these models to maintain their transparency andrelatively fast scoring times in higher-dimensional settings. In short,post-processing a fitted EBM with many (i.e., possibly hundreds or thousands)of terms using the LASSO can help reduce the model's complexity and drasticallyimprove scoring time.

A new and challengingtask, Story-to-Motion, arises when characters are required to move to variouslocations and perform specific motions based on a long text description. Thistask demands a fusion of low-level control (trajectories) and high-levelcontrol (motion semantics). Previous works in character control andtext-to-motion have addressed related aspects, yet a comprehensive solutionremains elusive: character control methods do not handle text description,whereas text-to-motion methods lack position constraints and often produceunstable motions. In light of these limitations, we propose a novel system thatgenerates controllable, infinitely long motions and trajectories aligned withthe input text. (1) We leverage contemporary Large Language Models to act as atext-driven motion scheduler to extract a series of (text, position, duration)pairs from long text. (2) We develop a text-driven motion retrieval scheme thatincorporates motion matching with motion semantic and trajectory constraints.(3) We design a progressive mask transformer that addresses common artifacts inthe transition motion such as unnatural pose and foot sliding. Beyond itspioneering role as the first comprehensive solution for Story-to-Motion, oursystem undergoes evaluation across three distinct sub-tasks: trajectoryfollowing, temporal action composition, and motion blending, where itoutperforms previous state-of-the-art motion synthesis methods across theboard.

To make LLMs more anthropomorphic and proactiveduring the conversation, we add five communication skills to the responsegeneration process: topic transition, proactively asking questions, conceptguidance, empathy, and summarising often. The addition of communication skillsincreases the interest of users in the conversation and attracts them to chatfor longer. To enable LLMs better understand and use communication skills, wedesign and add the inner monologue to LLMs. The complete process is achievedthrough prompt engineering and in-context learning. To evaluate communicationskills, we construct a benchmark named Cskills for evaluating variouscommunication skills, which can also more comprehensively evaluate the dialoguegeneration ability of the model.

As an alternative, we propose MaxEns, acombination strategy that is biased towards the most confident predictions,hypothesising that confident predictions are less prone to be hallucinations.We evaluate different strategies on the FLORES benchmark for 20 low-resourcelanguage directions, demonstrating that MaxEns improves translation quality forlow-resource languages while reducing hallucination in translations, comparedto both direct translation and an averaging approach.

Extensive research has been conducted on human tracking,pose estimation, gesture recognition, and activity recognition, which arepredominantly based on cameras in traditional methods. However, the intrusivenature of cameras limits their use in smart home applications. To address this,mmWave radars have gained popularity due to their privacy-friendly features. Inthis work, we propose milliFlow, a novel deep learning method for scene flowestimation as a complementary motion information for mmWave point cloud,serving as an intermediate level of features and directly benefiting downstreamhuman motion sensing tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superiorperformance of our method with an average 3D endpoint error of 4.6cm,significantly surpassing the competing approaches. Furthermore, byincorporating scene flow information, we achieve remarkable improvements inhuman activity recognition, human parsing, and human body part tracking. Tofoster further research in this area, we will provide our codebase and datasetfor open access upon acceptance.</description><author>Fangqiang Ding, Zhen Luo, Peijun Zhao, Chris Xiaoxuan Lu</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 16:06:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17010v3</guid></item><item><title>Supersampling of Data from Structured-light Scanner with Deep Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07432v1</link><description>This paper focuses on increasing the resolution of depth maps obtained from3D cameras using structured light technology. Two deep learning models FDSR andDKN are modified to work with high-resolution data, and data pre-processingtechniques are implemented for stable training. The models are trained on ourcustom dataset of 1200 3D scans. The resulting high-resolution depth maps areevaluated using qualitative and quantitative metrics. The approach for depthmap upsampling offers benefits such as reducing the processing time of apipeline by first downsampling a high-resolution depth map, performing variousprocessing steps at the lower resolution and upsampling the resulting depth mapor increasing the resolution of a point cloud captured in lower resolution by acheaper device. The experiments demonstrate that the FDSR model excels in termsof faster processing time, making it a suitable choice for applications wherespeed is crucial. On the other hand, the DKN model provides results with higherprecision, making it more suitable for applications that prioritize accuracy.</description><author>Martin Melicherƒç√≠k, Luk√°≈° Gajdo≈°ech, Viktor Kocur, Martin Madaras</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 16:04:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07432v1</guid></item><item><title>Controlled Text Generation for Black-box Language Models via Score-based Progressive Editor</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07430v1</link><description>Despite recent progress in language models, generating constrained text forspecific domains remains a challenge, particularly when utilizing black-boxmodels that lack domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we introduce ScoPE(Score-based Progressive Editor) generation, a novel approach for controlledtext generation for black-box language models. We employ ScoPE to facilitatetext generation in the target domain by integrating it with language modelsthrough a cascading approach. Trained to enhance the target domain score of theedited text, ScoPE progressively edits intermediate output discrete tokens toalign with the target attributes throughout the auto-regressive generationprocess of the language model. This iterative process guides subsequent stepsto produce desired output texts for the target domain. Our experimental resultson diverse controlled generations demonstrate that ScoPE effectivelyfacilitates controlled text generation for black-box language models in bothin-domain and out-of-domain conditions, which is challenging for existingmethods.</description><author>Sangwon Yu, Changmin Lee, Hojin Lee, Sungroh Yoon</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 16:03:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07430v1</guid></item><item><title>ChaTA: Towards an Intelligent Question-Answer Teaching Assistant using Open-Source LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02775v2</link><description>Responding to the thousands of student questions on online QA platforms eachsemester has a considerable human cost, particularly in computing courses withrapidly growing enrollments.

This poses challenges, particularly whenmodels have hard-to-detect failure modes and are able to take actions withoutoversight. In order to handle this challenge, we propose a method for acollaborative system that remains safe by having a human ultimately makingdecisions, while giving the model the best opportunity to convince and debatethem with interpretable explanations. However, the most helpful explanationvaries among individuals and may be inconsistent across stated preferences. Tothis end we develop an algorithm, Ardent, to efficiently learn a rankingthrough interaction and best assist humans complete a task. By utilising acollaborative approach, we can ensure safety and improve performance whileaddressing transparency and accountability concerns.

In contrast,counterfactual open book QA datasets would further improve attribution becausethe answer could only be grounded in the given text. We propose HallucinationAugmented Recitations (HAR) for creating counterfactual datasets by utilizinghallucination in LLMs to improve attribution. For open book QA as a case study,we demonstrate that models finetuned with our counterfactual datasets improvetext grounding, leading to better open book QA performance, with up to an 8.0%increase in F1 score.

Denoising diffusion probabilisticmodels (DDPM) have recently shown promise in modelling the distribution ofnatural images and were successfully applied to various medical imaging tasks.This work focuses on semi-supervised image segmentation using diffusion models,particularly addressing domain generalisation. Firstly, we demonstrate thatsmaller diffusion steps generate latent representations that are more robustfor downstream tasks than larger steps. Secondly, we use this insight topropose an improved esembling scheme that leverages information-dense smallsteps and the regularising effect of larger steps to generate predictions.

A common practice is to outsource thetraining process or collect more data over the Internet, which introduces therisks of a backdoored DNN. A backdoored DNN shows normal behavior on clean datawhile behaving maliciously once a trigger is injected into a sample at the testtime. In such cases, the defender faces multiple difficulties. First, theavailable clean dataset may not be sufficient for fine-tuning and recoveringthe backdoored DNN. Second, it is impossible to recover the trigger in manyreal-world applications without information about it. In this paper, weformulate some characteristics of poisoned neurons. This backdoorsuspiciousness score can rank network neurons according to their activationvalues, weights, and their relationship with other neurons in the same layer.Our experiments indicate the proposed method decreases the chance of attacksbeing successful by more than 50% with a tiny clean dataset, i.e., ten cleansamples for the CIFAR-10 dataset, without significantly deteriorating themodel's performance.

Traditional numericalmethods can simulate the complex behaviors of such flows that involvesolid-like to fluid-like transitions, but they are computationally intractablewhen simulating large-scale systems. Surrogate models based on statistical ormachine learning methods are a viable alternative, but they are typicallyempirical and rely on a confined set of parameters in evaluating associatedrisks. Due to their permutation-dependent learning, conventional machinelearning models require an unreasonably large amount of training data forbuilding generalizable surrogate models. We employ a graph neural network(GNN), a novel deep learning technique, to develop a GNN-based simulator (GNS)for granular flows to address these issues. Graphs represent the state ofgranular flows and interactions, like the exchange of energy and momentumbetween grains, and GNN learns the local interaction law. GNS takes the currentstate of the granular flow and estimates the next state using Euler explicitintegration. We train GNS on a limited set of granular flow trajectories andevaluate its performance in a three-dimensional granular column collapsedomain. GNS successfully reproduces the overall behaviors of column collapseswith various aspect ratios that were not encountered during training. Thecomputation speed of GNS outperforms high-fidelity numerical simulators by 300times.</description><author>Yongjin Choi, Krishna Kumar</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 15:54:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07416v1</guid></item><item><title>FIRST: A Million-Entry Dataset for Text-Driven Fashion Synthesis and Design</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07414v1</link><description>Text-driven fashion synthesis and design is an extremely valuable part ofartificial intelligence generative content(AIGC), which has the potential topropel a tremendous revolution in the traditional fashion industry.

For quantization FDTMsuggests that over 80% of parameters can naively be transformed to int8 withoutspecial outlier management. These evaluations indicate the necessity ofchoosing appropriate compressions for parameters individually-and that FDTM canidentify those-while standard metrics result in deteriorated outcomes.</description><author>Bj√∂rn Deiseroth, Max Meuer, Nikolas Gritsch, Constantin Eichenberg, Patrick Schramowski, Matthias A√üenmacher, Kristian Kersting</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 15:33:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01544v2</guid></item><item><title>Processing and Segmentation of Human Teeth from 2D Images using Weakly Supervised Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07398v1</link><description>Teeth segmentation is an essential task in dental image analysis for accuratediagnosis and treatment planning.

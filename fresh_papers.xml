Rotation and injection are some of the proven ways in active flowcontrol for drag reduction on blunt bodies. In this paper, rotation will beadded to the cylinder alongside the deep reinforcement learning (DRL)algorithm, which uses multiple controlled jets to reach the maximum possibledrag suppression. Characteristics of the DRL code, including controllingparameters, their limitations, and optimization of the DRL network for use withrotation will be presented. This work will focus on optimizing the number andpositions of the jets, the sensors location, and the maximum allowed flow rateto jets in the form of the maximum allowed flow rate of each actuation and thetotal number of them per episode. It is found that combining the rotation andDRL is promising since it suppresses the vortex shedding, stabilizes the Karmanvortex street, and reduces the drag coefficient by up to 49.75%. Also, it willbe shown that having more sensors at more locations is not always a good choiceand the sensor number and location should be determined based on the need ofthe user and corresponding configuration. Also, allowing the agent to haveaccess to higher flow rates, mostly reduces the performance, except when thecylinder rotates. In all cases, the agent can keep the lift coefficient at avalue near zero, or stabilize it at a smaller number.</description><author>Kamyar Dobakhti, Jafar Ghazanfarian</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 18:46:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12083v3</guid></item><item><title>A Turing Test: Are AI Chatbots Behaviorally Similar to Humans?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00798v2</link><description>We administer a Turing Test to AI Chatbots. We examine how Chatbots behave ina suite of classic behavioral games that are designed to elicit characteristicssuch as trust, fairness, risk-aversion, cooperation, \textit{etc.}, as well ashow they respond to a traditional Big-5 psychological survey that measurespersonality traits. ChatGPT-4 exhibits behavioral and personality traits thatare statistically indistinguishable from a random human from tens of thousandsof human subjects from more than 50 countries. Chatbots also modify theirbehavior based on previous experience and contexts ``as if'' they were learningfrom the interactions, and change their behavior in response to differentframings of the same strategic situation. Their behaviors are often distinctfrom average and modal human behaviors, in which case they tend to behave onthe more altruistic and cooperative end of the distribution. We estimate thatthey act as if they are maximizing an average of their own and partner'spayoffs.</description><author>Qiaozhu Mei, Yutong Xie, Walter Yuan, Matthew O.

Among many vulnerabilities, the risk of Byzantine attacks isof particular concern, which refers to the possibility of malicious clientsparticipating in the learning process. Hence, a crucial objective in FL is toneutralize the potential impact of Byzantine attacks and to ensure that thefinal model is trustable. It has been observed that the higher the varianceamong the clients' models/updates, the more space there is for Byzantineattacks to be hidden. As a consequence, by utilizing momentum, and thus,reducing the variance, it is possible to weaken the strength of known Byzantineattacks. The centered clipping (CC) framework has further shown that themomentum term from the previous iteration, besides reducing the variance, canbe used as a reference point to neutralize Byzantine attacks better. In thiswork, we first expose vulnerabilities of the CC framework, and introduce anovel attack strategy that can circumvent the defences of CC and other robustaggregators and reduce their test accuracy up to %33 on best-case scenarios inimage classification tasks. Then, we propose a new robust and fast defencemechanism that is effective against the proposed and other existing Byzantineattacks.</description><author>Kerem Ozfatura, Emre Ozfatura, Alptekin Kupcu, Deniz Gunduz</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 17:55:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09894v3</guid></item><item><title>Revisiting inference after prediction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13746v2</link><description>Recent work has focused on the very common practice of prediction-basedinference: that is, (i) using a pre-trained machine learning model to predictan unobserved response variable, and then (ii) conducting inference on theassociation between that predicted response and some covariates. As pointed outby Wang et al. (2020), applying a standard inferential approach in (ii) doesnot accurately quantify the association between the unobserved (as opposed tothe predicted) response and the covariates. In recent work, Wang et al. (2020)and Angelopoulos et al. (2023) propose corrections to step (ii) in order toenable valid inference on the association between the unobserved response andthe covariates. Here, we show that the method proposed by Angelopoulos et al.(2023) successfully controls the type 1 error rate and provides confidenceintervals with correct nominal coverage, regardless of the quality of thepre-trained machine learning model used to predict the unobserved response.However, the method proposed by Wang et al. (2020) provides valid inferenceonly under very strong conditions that rarely hold in practice: for instance,if the machine learning model perfectly estimates the true regression functionin the study population of interest.</description><author>Keshav Motwani, Daniela Witten</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 17:11:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13746v2</guid></item><item><title>Transfer Learning for Causal Effect Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09126v3</link><description>We present a Transfer Causal Learning (TCL) framework when target and sourcedomains share the same covariate/feature spaces, aiming to improve causaleffect estimation accuracy in limited data. Limited data is very common inmedical applications, where some rare medical conditions, such as sepsis, areof interest. Our proposed method, named \texttt{$\ell_1$-TCL}, incorporates$\ell_1$ regularized TL for nuisance models (e.g., propensity score model); theTL estimator of the nuisance parameters is plugged into downstream averagecausal/treatment effect estimators (e.g., inverse probability weightedestimator). We establish non-asymptotic recovery guarantees for the\texttt{$\ell_1$-TCL} with generalized linear model (GLM) under the sparsityassumption in the high-dimensional setting, and demonstrate the empiricalbenefits of \texttt{$\ell_1$-TCL} through extensive numerical simulation forGLM and recent neural network nuisance models. Our method is subsequentlyextended to real data and generates meaningful insights consistent with medicalliterature, a case where all baseline methods fail.</description><author>Song Wei, Hanyu Zhang, Ronald Moore, Rishikesan Kamaleswaran, Yao Xie</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 17:04:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09126v3</guid></item><item><title>Decision-Focused Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Reward Transfer</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03365v2</link><description>Decision-focused (DF) model-based reinforcement learning has recently beenintroduced as a powerful algorithm that can focus on learning the MDP dynamicsthat are most relevant for obtaining high returns. While this approachincreases the agent's performance by directly optimizing the reward, it does soby learning less accurate dynamics from a maximum likelihood perspective. Wedemonstrate that when the reward function is defined by preferences overmultiple objectives, the DF model may be sensitive to changes in the objectivepreferences.In this work, we develop the robust decision-focused (RDF)algorithm, which leverages the non-identifiability of DF solutions to learnmodels that maximize expected returns while simultaneously learning models thattransfer to changes in the preference over multiple objectives.

Most DP-FLapproaches ensure DP at the record-level within each silo for cross-silo FL.However, a single user's data may extend across multiple silos, and the desireduser-level DP guarantee for such a setting remains unknown. In this study, wepresent Uldp-FL, a novel FL framework designed to guarantee user-level DP incross-silo FL where a single user's data may belong to multiple silos. Ourproposed algorithm directly ensures user-level DP through per-user weightedclipping, departing from group-privacy approaches. We provide a theoreticalanalysis of the algorithm's privacy and utility. Additionally, we enhance theutility of the proposed algorithm with an enhanced weighting strategy based onuser record distribution and design a novel private protocol that ensures noadditional information is revealed to the silos and the server. Experiments onreal-world datasets show substantial improvements in our methods inprivacy-utility trade-offs under user-level DP compared to baseline methods. Tothe best of our knowledge, our work is the first FL framework that effectivelyprovides user-level DP in the general cross-silo FL setting.</description><author>Fumiyuki Kato, Li Xiong, Shun Takagi, Yang Cao, Masatoshi Yoshikawa</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 15:52:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12210v2</guid></item><item><title>COMBHelper: A Neural Approach to Reduce Search Space for Graph Combinatorial Problems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09086v2</link><description>Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems over graphs appear routinely in manyapplications such as in optimizing traffic, viral marketing in social networks,and matching for job allocation. Due to their combinatorial nature, theseproblems are often NP-hard. Existing approximation algorithms and heuristicsrely on the search space to find the solutions and become time-consuming whenthis space is large. In this paper, we design a neural method called COMBHelperto reduce this space and thus improve the efficiency of the traditional COalgorithms based on node selection. Specifically, it employs a Graph NeuralNetwork (GNN) to identify promising nodes for the solution set. This prunedsearch space is then fed to the traditional CO algorithms. COMBHelper also usesa Knowledge Distillation (KD) module and a problem-specific boosting module tobring further efficiency and efficacy. Our extensive experiments show that thetraditional CO algorithms with COMBHelper are at least 2 times faster thantheir original versions.</description><author>Hao Tian, Sourav Medya, Wei Ye</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 15:21:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09086v2</guid></item><item><title>Q-Bench: A Benchmark for General-Purpose Foundation Models on Low-level Vision</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14181v3</link><description>The rapid evolution of Multi-modality Large Language Models (MLLMs) hascatalyzed a shift in computer vision from specialized models to general-purposefoundation models. Nevertheless, there is still an inadequacy in assessing theabilities of MLLMs on low-level visual perception and understanding. To addressthis gap, we present Q-Bench, a holistic benchmark crafted to systematicallyevaluate potential abilities of MLLMs on three realms: low-level visualperception, low-level visual description, and overall visual qualityassessment. a) To evaluate the low-level perception ability, we construct theLLVisionQA dataset, consisting of 2,990 diverse-sourced images, each equippedwith a human-asked question focusing on its low-level attributes. We thenmeasure the correctness of MLLMs on answering these questions. b) To examinethe description ability of MLLMs on low-level information, we propose theLLDescribe dataset consisting of long expert-labelled golden low-level textdescriptions on 499 images, and a GPT-involved comparison pipeline betweenoutputs of MLLMs and the golden descriptions. c) Besides these two tasks, wefurther measure their visual quality assessment ability to align with humanopinion scores. Specifically, we design a softmax-based strategy that enablesMLLMs to predict quantifiable quality scores, and evaluate them on variousexisting image quality assessment (IQA) datasets. Our evaluation across thethree abilities confirms that MLLMs possess preliminary low-level visualskills. However, these skills are still unstable and relatively imprecise,indicating the need for specific enhancements on MLLMs towards these abilities.We hope that our benchmark can encourage the research community to delve deeperto discover and enhance these untapped potentials of MLLMs. Project Page:https://q-future.github.io/Q-Bench.</description><author>Haoning Wu, Zicheng Zhang, Erli Zhang, Chaofeng Chen, Liang Liao, Annan Wang, Chunyi Li, Wenxiu Sun, Qiong Yan, Guangtao Zhai, Weisi Lin</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 14:48:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14181v3</guid></item><item><title>FENet: Focusing Enhanced Network for Lane Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17163v2</link><description>Inspired by human driving focus, this research pioneers networks augmentedwith Focusing Sampling, Partial Field of View Evaluation, Enhanced FPNarchitecture and Directional IoU Loss - targeted innovations addressingobstacles to precise lane detection for autonomous driving.

However,applying the VSR model to real-world video with unknown and complex degradationremains a challenging task. First, existing degradation metrics in most VSRmethods are not able to effectively simulate real-world noise and blur. On thecontrary, simple combinations of classical degradation are used for real-worldnoise modeling, which led to the VSR model often being violated byout-of-distribution noise. Second, many SR models focus on noise simulation andtransfer. Nevertheless, the sampled noise is monotonous and limited. To addressthe aforementioned problems, we propose a Negatives augmentation strategy forgeneralized noise modeling in Video Super-Resolution (NegVSR) task.Specifically, we first propose sequential noise generation toward real-worlddata to extract practical noise sequences. Then, the degeneration domain iswidely expanded by negative augmentation to build up various yet challengingreal-world noise sets. We further propose the augmented negative guidance lossto learn robust features among augmented negatives effectively. Extensiveexperiments on real-world datasets (e.g., VideoLQ and FLIR) show that ourmethod outperforms state-of-the-art methods with clear margins, especially invisual quality.

This paper presents a novel benchmark, AssistGUI, toevaluate whether models are capable of manipulating the mouse and keyboard onthe Windows platform in response to user-requested tasks. We carefullycollected a set of 100 tasks from nine widely-used software applications, suchas, After Effects and MS Word, each accompanied by the necessary project filesfor better evaluation. Moreover, we propose an advanced Actor-Critic EmbodiedAgent framework, which incorporates a sophisticated GUI parser driven by anLLM-agent and an enhanced reasoning mechanism adept at handling lengthyprocedural tasks. Our experimental results reveal that our GUI Parser andReasoning mechanism outshine existing methods in performance. Nevertheless, thepotential remains substantial, with the best model attaining only a 46% successrate on our benchmark. We conclude with a thorough analysis of the currentmethods' limitations, setting the stage for future breakthroughs in thisdomain.</description><author>Difei Gao, Lei Ji, Zechen Bai, Mingyu Ouyang, Peiran Li, Dongxing Mao, Qinchen Wu, Weichen Zhang, Peiyi Wang, Xiangwu Guo, Hengxu Wang, Luowei Zhou, Mike Zheng Shou</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 14:26:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13108v2</guid></item><item><title>Asynchronous Evolution of Deep Neural Network Architectures</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04102v3</link><description>Many evolutionary algorithms (EAs) take advantage of parallel evaluation ofcandidates. However, if evaluation times vary significantly, many worker nodes(i.e.,\ compute clients) are idle much of the time, waiting for the nextgeneration to be created. Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS), aclass of EAs that optimizes the architecture and hyperparameters of deep neuralnetworks, is particularly vulnerable to this issue. This paper proposes ageneric asynchronous evaluation strategy (AES) that is then adapted to workwith ENAS. AES increases throughput by maintaining a queue of up to $K$individuals ready to be sent to the workers for evaluation and proceeding tothe next generation as soon as $M&lt;&lt;K$ individuals have been evaluated. Asuitable value for $M$ is determined experimentally, balancing diversity andefficiency. To showcase the generality and power of AES, it was first evaluatedin eight-line sorting network design (a single-population optimization taskwith limited evaluation-time variability), achieving an over two-fold speedup.Next, it was evaluated in 11-bit multiplexer design (a single-populationdiscovery task with extended variability), where a 14-fold speedup wasobserved. It was then scaled up to ENAS for image captioning (amulti-population open-ended-optimization task), resulting in an over two-foldspeedup. In all problems, a multifold performance improvement was observed,suggesting that AES is a promising method for parallelizing the evolution ofcomplex systems with long and variable evaluation times, such as those in ENAS.</description><author>Jason Liang, Hormoz Shahrzad, Risto Miikkulainen</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 14:16:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04102v3</guid></item><item><title>UDTIRI: An Online Open-Source Intelligent Road Inspection Benchmark Suite</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08842v3</link><description>In the nascent domain of urban digital twins (UDT), the prospects forleveraging cutting-edge deep learning techniques are vast and compelling.Particularly within the specialized area of intelligent road inspection (IRI),a noticeable gap exists, underscored by the current dearth of dedicatedresearch efforts and the lack of large-scale well-annotated datasets.

State-of-the-art anytimeMAPF is based on Large Neighborhood Search (LNS), where a fast initial solutionis iteratively optimized by destroying and repairing a fixed number of parts,i.e., the neighborhood, of the solution, using randomized destroy heuristicsand prioritized planning. Despite their recent success in various MAPFinstances, current LNS-based approaches lack exploration and flexibility due togreedy optimization with a fixed neighborhood size which can lead to lowquality solutions in general. So far, these limitations have been addressedwith extensive prior effort in tuning or offline machine learning beyond actualplanning. In this paper, we focus on online learning in LNS and proposeBandit-based Adaptive LArge Neighborhood search Combined with Exploration(BALANCE). BALANCE uses a bi-level multi-armed bandit scheme to adapt theselection of destroy heuristics and neighborhood sizes on the fly duringsearch. We evaluate BALANCE on multiple maps from the MAPF benchmark set andempirically demonstrate cost improvements of at least 50% compared tostate-of-the-art anytime MAPF in large-scale scenarios.

Additionally, utilizing a parallel configuration within eachTransformer block rather than the conventional serialized method has beenrevealed to accelerate the training of LLMs without significantly impactingperformance. However, when the MLP and attention block were run in parallel forthe image classification task, we observed a noticeable decline in performance.We propose a novel transformer variant that integrates non-linearity within theattention block to tackle this problem. We implemented the GLU-based activationfunction on the Value tensor, and this new technique surpasses the currentstate-of-the-art S/16 variant of Vision Transformers by 0.6% on the ImageNet-1Kdataset while utilizing fewer parameters. It also supersedes the B/16 variantwhile using only half the parameters. Furthermore, we provide results with theGELU activation function variant to confirm our assertions.

FL expands the availability of data for FMs andenables computation sharing, distributing the training process and reducing theburden on FL participants. It promotes collaborative FM development,democratizing the process and fostering inclusivity and innovation.

We also employ ameta-consistency training scheme to simulate domain shifts, optimizing themodel with a carefully designed consistency loss to encourage domain-invariantrepresentations. In the inference phase, we introduce an intra-system domainalignment mechanism to reduce or potentially eliminate the domain discrepancyamong CAVs prior to inference. Comprehensive experiments substantiate theeffectiveness of our method in comparison with the existing state-of-the-artworks.

Current techniques rely heavily on HDR panorama datasets to trainneural networks to regress an input with limited field-of-view to a fullenvironment map. However, these approaches often struggle with real-world,uncontrolled settings due to the limited diversity and size of their datasets.To address this problem, we leverage diffusion models trained on billions ofstandard images to render a chrome ball into the input image. Despite itssimplicity, this task remains challenging: the diffusion models often insertincorrect or inconsistent objects and cannot readily generate images in HDRformat. Our research uncovers a surprising relationship between the appearanceof chrome balls and the initial diffusion noise map, which we utilize toconsistently generate high-quality chrome balls. We further fine-tune an LDRdifusion model (Stable Diffusion XL) with LoRA, enabling it to perform exposurebracketing for HDR light estimation. Our method produces convincing lightestimates across diverse settings and demonstrates superior generalization toin-the-wild scenarios.</description><author>Pakkapon Phongthawee, Worameth Chinchuthakun, Nontaphat Sinsunthithet, Amit Raj, Varun Jampani, Pramook Khungurn, Supasorn Suwajanakorn</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 10:15:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09168v2</guid></item><item><title>Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms for Multi-Valued Decision Variables</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14420v2</link><description>The majority of research on estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs)concentrates on pseudo-Boolean optimization and permutation problems, leavingthe domain of EDAs for problems in which the decision variables can take morethan two values, but which are not permutation problems, mostly unexplored. Torender this domain more accessible, we propose a natural way to extend theknown univariate EDAs to this setting. Different from a naive reduction to thebinary case, our approach avoids additional constraints. Since understanding genetic drift is crucial for an optimal parameter choice,we extend the known quantitative analysis of genetic drift to EDAs formulti-valued variables. Roughly speaking, when the variables take $r$ differentvalues, the time for genetic drift to become significant is $r$ times shorterthan in the binary case. Consequently, the update strength of the probabilisticmodel has to be chosen $r$ times lower now. To investigate how desired model updates take place in this framework, weundertake a mathematical runtime analysis on the $r$-valued \leadingonesproblem. We prove that with the right parameters, the multi-valued UMDA solvesthis problem efficiently in $O(r\ln(r)^2 n^2 \ln(n))$ function evaluations.This bound is nearly tight as our lower bound $\Omega(r\ln(r) n^2 \ln(n))$shows. Overall, our work shows that our good understanding of binary EDAs naturallyextends to the multi-valued setting, and it gives advice on how to set the mainparameters of multi-values EDAs.</description><author>Firas Ben Jedidia, Benjamin Doerr, Martin S.

Despitethe growing research outcomes in this area, there has been a notable oversightregarding the temporal dynamic relationships between these streams, leading tothe issue of negative transfer arising from irrelevant data. In this paper, wepropose a novel Online Boosting Adaptive Learning (OBAL) method thateffectively addresses this limitation by adaptively learning the dynamiccorrelation among different streams. Specifically, OBAL operates in adual-phase mechanism, in the first of which we design an Adaptive COvariateShift Adaptation (AdaCOSA) algorithm to construct an initialized ensemble modelusing archived data from various source streams, thus mitigating the covariateshift while learning the dynamic correlations via an adaptive re-weightingstrategy. During the online process, we employ a Gaussian Mixture Model-basedweighting mechanism, which is seamlessly integrated with the acquiredcorrelations via AdaCOSA to effectively handle asynchronous drift. Thisapproach significantly improves the predictive performance and stability of thetarget stream. We conduct comprehensive experiments on several synthetic andreal-world data streams, encompassing various drifting scenarios and types. Theresults clearly demonstrate that OBAL achieves remarkable advancements inaddressing multistream classification problems by effectively leveragingpositive knowledge derived from multiple sources.</description><author>En Yu, Jie Lu, Bin Zhang, Guangquan Zhang</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 09:39:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10841v2</guid></item><item><title>An attempt to generate new bridge types from latent space of variational autoencoder</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03380v2</link><description>Try to generate new bridge types using generative artificial intelligencetechnology.

However, the rich structured information in Wikipedia, suchas the titles, abstracts, hierarchical heading (multi-level title) structure,relationship between articles, references, hyperlink structures, and thewriting organizations, has not been fully explored. In this paper, we devisefour pre-training objectives tailored for IR tasks based on the structuredknowledge of Wikipedia.

Encoding such highly similar texture features often requiresdeep layers and a large number of channels, making it is also the main sourceof the entire model's parameter count and computational load, and inferencetime. We propose a lightweight texture transfer based on texture feature preset(TFP). TFP takes full advantage of the high repetitiveness of texture featuresby providing preset universal texture feature maps for a given style. Thesepreset feature maps can be fused and decoded directly with shallow colortransfer feature maps of any content to generate texture transfer results,thereby avoiding redundant texture information from being encoded repeatedly.The texture feature map we preset is encoded through noise input images withconsistent distribution (standard normal distribution). This consistent inputdistribution can completely avoid the problem of texture transferdifferentiation, and by randomly sampling different noise inputs, we can obtaindifferent texture features and texture transfer results under the samereference style. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, our TFP not onlyproduces visually superior results but also reduces the model size by 3.2-3538times and speeds up the process by 1.8-5.6 times.</description><author>ShiQi Jiang</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 06:25:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16846v3</guid></item><item><title>A Method to Improve the Performance of Reinforcement Learning Based on the Y Operator for a Class of Stochastic Differential Equation-Based Child-Mother Systems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04014v3</link><description>This paper introduces a novel operator, termed the Y operator, to elevatecontrol performance in Actor-Critic(AC) based reinforcement learning forsystems governed by stochastic differential equations(SDEs).

However, determining an optimal knowledge fusion ratio that balancesthese supervisory signals remains challenging. Prior methods generally resortto a constant or heuristic-based fusion ratio, which often falls short of aproper balance. In this study, we introduce a novel adaptive method forlearning a sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio, exploiting both the correctnessof teacher and student, as well as how well the student mimics the teacher oneach sample. Our method naturally leads to the intra-sample trilateralgeometric relations among the student prediction ($S$), teacher prediction($T$), and ground truth ($G$). To counterbalance the impact of outliers, wefurther extend to the inter-sample relations, incorporating the teacher'sglobal average prediction $\bar{T}$ for samples within the same class.

It proves that stochasticgradient-based training implicitly regularizes neural networks towards low-ranksolutions through a gradual increase of the rank during training. However,there is a gap between theory and practice since GLRL requires an infinitesimalinitialization of the weights, which is not practical due to the fact that itis a saddle point. In this work, we remove the assumption of infinitesimalinitialization by focusing on cumulative weight updates. We prove thecumulative weight updates follow an incremental low-rank trajectory forarbitrary orthogonal initialization of weights in a three-layer linear network.Empirically, we demonstrate that our theory holds on a broad range of neuralnetworks (e.g., transformers) and standard training algorithms (e.g., SGD,Adam). However, existing training algorithms do not exploit the low-rankproperty to improve computational efficiency as the networks are notparameterized in low-rank. To remedy this, we design a new training algorithmIncremental Low-Rank Learning (InRank), which explicitly expresses cumulativeweight updates as low-rank matrices while incrementally augmenting their ranksduring training. We evaluate InRank on GPT-2, and our results indicate thatInRank achieves comparable prediction performance as the full-rank counterpartwhile requiring at most 33% of the total ranks throughout training.

It is useful for various real-world applications, such as abstractivesnippet generation or more recent retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Aprototypical QFS pipeline consists of a retriever (sparse or dense retrieval)and a generator (usually a large language model). However, applying largelanguage models (LLM) potentially leads to hallucinations, especially when theevidence contradicts the prior belief of LLMs. There has been growing interestin developing new decoding methods to improve generation quality and reducehallucination. In this work, we conduct a large-scale reproducibility study onone recently proposed decoding method -- Context-aware Decoding (CAD). Inaddition to replicating CAD's experiments on news summarization datasets, weinclude experiments on QFS datasets, and conduct more rigorous analysis oncomputational complexity and hyperparameter sensitivity. Experiments with eightdifferent language models show that performance-wise, CAD improves QFS qualityby (1) reducing factuality errors/hallucinations while (2) mostly retaining thematch of lexical patterns, measured by ROUGE scores, while also at a cost ofincreased inference-time FLOPs and reduced decoding speed.

To partially overcome theissue, max K sliced Wasserstein (Max-K-SW) distance ($K\geq 1$), seeks the bestdiscriminative orthogonal projecting directions. Despite being able to reducethe number of projections, the metricity of Max-K-SW cannot be guaranteed inpractice due to the non-optimality of the optimization. Moreover, theorthogonality constraint is also computationally expensive and might not beeffective. To address the problem, we introduce a new family of SW distances,named Markovian sliced Wasserstein (MSW) distance, which imposes a first-orderMarkov structure on projecting directions. We discuss various members of MSW byspecifying the Markov structure including the prior distribution, thetransition distribution, and the burning and thinning technique. Moreover, weinvestigate the theoretical properties of MSW including topological properties(metricity, weak convergence, and connection to other distances), statisticalproperties (sample complexity, and Monte Carlo estimation error), andcomputational properties (computational complexity and memory complexity).Finally, we compare MSW distances with previous SW variants in variousapplications such as gradient flows, color transfer, and deep generativemodeling to demonstrate the favorable performance of MSW.</description><author>Khai Nguyen, Tongzheng Ren, Nhat Ho</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 21:54:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03749v3</guid></item><item><title>Stable Unlearnable Example: Enhancing the Robustness of Unlearnable Examples via Stable Error-Minimizing Noise</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13091v2</link><description>The open source of large amounts of image data promotes the development ofdeep learning techniques. Along with this comes the privacy risk of theseopen-source image datasets being exploited by unauthorized third parties totrain deep learning models for commercial or illegal purposes. To avoid theabuse of public data, a poisoning-based technique, the unlearnable example, isproposed to significantly degrade the generalization performance of models byadding a kind of imperceptible noise to the data. To further enhance itsrobustness against adversarial training, existing works leverage iterativeadversarial training on both the defensive noise and the surrogate model.However, it still remains unknown whether the robustness of unlearnableexamples primarily comes from the effect of enhancement in the surrogate modelor the defensive noise. Observing that simply removing the adversarial noise onthe training process of the defensive noise can improve the performance ofrobust unlearnable examples, we identify that solely the surrogate model'srobustness contributes to the performance. Furthermore, we found a negativecorrelation exists between the robustness of defensive noise and the protectionperformance, indicating defensive noise's instability issue. Motivated by this,to further boost the robust unlearnable example, we introduce stableerror-minimizing noise (SEM), which trains the defensive noise against randomperturbation instead of the time-consuming adversarial perturbation to improvethe stability of defensive noise. Through extensive experiments, we demonstratethat SEM achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,and ImageNet Subset in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

The number of quantum measurements N required for areasonable kernel estimate is a critical resource, both from complexityconsiderations and because of the constraints of near-term quantum hardware. Weemphasize that for classification tasks, the aim is reliable classification andnot precise kernel evaluation, and demonstrate that the former is far moreresource efficient. Furthermore, it is shown that the accuracy ofclassification is not a suitable performance metric in the presence of noiseand we motivate a new metric that characterizes the reliability ofclassification. We then obtain a bound for N which ensures, with highprobability, that classification errors over a dataset are bounded by themargin errors of an idealized quantum kernel classifier. Using chanceconstraint programming and the subgaussian bounds of quantum kerneldistributions, we derive several Shot-frugal and Robust (ShofaR) programsstarting from the primal formulation of the Support Vector Machine. Thissignificantly reduces the number of quantum measurements needed and is robustto noise by construction. Our strategy is applicable to uncertainty in quantumkernels arising from any source of unbiased noise.</description><author>Abhay Shastry, Abhijith Jayakumar, Apoorva Patel, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 18:33:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06971v3</guid></item><item><title>PGS: Pose-Guided Supervision for Mitigating Clothes-Changing in Person Re-Identification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05634v2</link><description>Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) task seeks to enhance the tracking ofmultiple individuals by surveillance cameras. It provides additional supportfor multimodal tasks, including text-based person retrieval and human matching.Among the significant challenges faced in Re-ID, one of the most prominent isdealing with clothes-changing, where the same person may appear in differentoutfits. While previous methods have made notable progress in maintainingclothing data consistency and handling clothing change data, they still tend torely excessively on clothing information, which can limit performance due tothe dynamic nature of human appearances. To mitigate this challenge, we proposethe Pose-Guided Supervision (PGS), an effective framework for learning poseguidance within the Re-ID task. Our PGS consists of three modules: a humanencoder, a pose encoder, and a Pose-to-Human Projection module (PHP). The poseencoder module utilizes a frozen pre-trained model while we fine-tune apre-trained human-centric model for the human encoder module. Our PHP transferspose knowledge from the pose encoder module to the human encoder module throughmultiple projectors.

Unlike previous approaches, weuse a convolutional neural network (CNN) that was trained solely usingsimulated data. Using only simulated data has the benefit of completelysidestepping the time-consuming process of manual annotation that is requiredfor supervised training on real eye images. To systematically evaluate theaccuracy of our method, we first tested it on images with simulated CRs placedon different backgrounds and embedded in varying levels of noise. Second, wetested the method on high-quality videos captured from real eyes. Our methodoutperformed state-of-the-art algorithmic methods on real eye images with a 35%reduction in terms of spatial precision, and performed on par withstate-of-the-art on simulated images in terms of spatial accuracy.We concludethat our method provides a precise method for CR center localization andprovides a solution to the data availability problem which is one of theimportant common roadblocks in the development of deep learning models for gazeestimation.

While thefield of CausalNLP has attracted much interest in the recent years, existingcausal inference datasets in NLP primarily rely on discovering causality fromempirical knowledge (e.g., commonsense knowledge). In this work, we propose thefirst benchmark dataset to test the pure causal inference skills of largelanguage models (LLMs). Specifically, we formulate a novel task Corr2Cause,which takes a set of correlational statements and determines the causalrelationship between the variables. We curate a large-scale dataset of morethan 200K samples, on which we evaluate seventeen existing LLMs. Through ourexperiments, we identify a key shortcoming of LLMs in terms of their causalinference skills, and show that these models achieve almost close to randomperformance on the task. This shortcoming is somewhat mitigated when we try tore-purpose LLMs for this skill via finetuning, but we find that these modelsstill fail to generalize -- they can only perform causal inference inin-distribution settings when variable names and textual expressions used inthe queries are similar to those in the training set, but fail inout-of-distribution settings generated by perturbing these queries. Corr2Causeis a challenging task for LLMs, and would be helpful in guiding future researchon improving LLMs' pure reasoning skills and generalizability.

However, this impressive rangedoes not inherently imply that all these colours have been precisely named anddescribed within our lexicon. We often associate colours with familiar objectsand concepts in our daily lives. This research endeavors to bridge the gapbetween our visual perception of countless shades and our ability to articulateand name them accurately. A novel model has been developed to achieve thisgoal, leveraging Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks withActive learning. This model operates on a proprietary dataset meticulouslycurated for this study. The primary objective of this research is to create aversatile tool for categorizing and naming previously unnamed colours oridentifying intermediate shades that elude traditional colour terminology. Thefindings underscore the potential of this innovative approach inrevolutionizing our understanding of colour perception and language. Throughrigorous experimentation and analysis, this study illuminates a promisingavenue for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications in diverseindustries. By facilitating the exploration of the vast colour spectrum thepotential applications of NLP are extended beyond conventional boundaries.</description><author>A.

However, they can produce subpar fake images due to limitedtraining data. Although Negative Data Augmentation (NDA) effectively enhancesunconditional and class-conditional GANs by introducing anomalies into realtraining images, guiding the GANs away from low-quality outputs, its impact onCcGANs is limited, as it fails to replicate negative samples that may occurduring the CcGAN sampling. We present a novel NDA approach called Dual-NDAspecifically tailored for CcGANs to address this problem. Dual-NDA employs twotypes of negative samples: visually unrealistic images generated from apre-trained CcGAN and label-inconsistent images created by manipulating realimages' labels. Leveraging these negative samples, we introduce a noveldiscriminator objective alongside a modified CcGAN training algorithm.Empirical analysis on UTKFace and Steering Angle reveals that Dual-NDAconsistently enhances the visual fidelity and label consistency of fake imagesgenerated by CcGANs, exhibiting a substantial performance gain over the vanillaNDA.

Measurements of nuclear characteristics (morphometry) canimprove reproducibility, but manual methods are time consuming. In this study,we evaluated fully automated morphometry using a deep learning-based algorithmin 96 canine cutaneous mast cell tumors with information on patient survival.Algorithmic morphometry was compared with karyomegaly estimates by 11pathologists, manual nuclear morphometry of 12 cells by 9 pathologists, and themitotic count as a benchmark. The prognostic value of automated morphometry washigh with an area under the ROC curve regarding the tumor-specific survival of0.943 (95% CI: 0.889 - 0.996) for the standard deviation (SD) of nuclear area,which was higher than manual morphometry of all pathologists combined (0.868,95% CI: 0.737 - 0.991) and the mitotic count (0.885, 95% CI: 0.765 - 1.00). Atthe proposed thresholds, the hazard ratio for algorithmic morphometry (SD ofnuclear area $\geq 9.0 \mu m^2$) was 18.3 (95% CI: 5.0 - 67.1), for manualmorphometry (SD of nuclear area $\geq 10.9 \mu m^2$) 9.0 (95% CI: 6.0 - 13.4),for karyomegaly estimates 7.6 (95% CI: 5.7 - 10.1), and for the mitotic count30.5 (95% CI: 7.8 - 118.0). Inter-rater reproducibility for karyomegalyestimates was fair ($\kappa$ = 0.226) with highly variablesensitivity/specificity values for the individual pathologists. Reproducibilityfor manual morphometry (SD of nuclear area) was good (ICC = 0.654).

Current solutions can be divided into two categories,reconstruction-based and Siamese network-based. The former requires that thetransformed or transforming image can be perfectly converted back to theoriginal image, which is sometimes too strict and limits the generativeperformance. The latter involves feeding the original and generated images intoa feature extractor and then matching their outputs. This is not efficientenough, and a universal feature extractor is not easily available. In thispaper, we propose EnCo, a simple but efficient way to maintain the content byconstraining the representational similarity in the latent space of patch-levelfeatures from the same stage of the \textbf{En}coder and de\textbf{Co}der ofthe generator. For the similarity function, we use a simple MSE loss instead ofcontrastive loss, which is currently widely used in I2I tasks. Benefits fromthe design, EnCo training is extremely efficient, while the features from theencoder produce a more positive effect on the decoding, leading to moresatisfying generations. In addition, we rethink the role played bydiscriminators in sampling patches and propose a discriminativeattention-guided (DAG) patch sampling strategy to replace random sampling. DAGis parameter-free and only requires negligible computational overhead, whilesignificantly improving the performance of the model. Extensive experiments onmultiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of EnCo, and weachieve multiple state-of-the-art compared to previous methods.

Traditional approaches in the semi-supervised (SS) and missing dataliterature may not adequately handle these complexities, leading to biasedestimates. To address these challenges, our paper introduces a novel decayingmissing-at-random (decaying MAR) framework. This framework tackles missingoutcomes in high-dimensional settings and accounts for selection bias arisingfrom the dependence of labeling probability on covariates. Notably, we relaxthe need for a positivity condition, commonly required in the missing dataliterature, and allow uniform decay of labeling propensity scores with samplesize, accommodating faster growth of unlabeled data. Our decaying MAR frameworkenables easy rate double-robust (DR) estimation of average treatment effects,succeeding where other methods fail, even with correctly specified nuisancemodels. Additionally, it facilitates asymptotic normality under modelmisspecification. To achieve this, we propose adaptive new targetedbias-reducing nuisance estimators and asymmetric cross-fitting, along with anovel semi-parametric approach that fully leverages large volumes of unlabeleddata. Our approach requires weak sparsity conditions. Numerical results confirmour estimators' efficacy and versatility, addressing selection bias and modelmisspecification.</description><author>Yuqian Zhang, Abhishek Chakrabortty, Jelena Bradic</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 11:35:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12789v2</guid></item><item><title>Ensemble forecasts in reproducing kernel Hilbert space family</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14653v4</link><description>A methodological framework for ensemble-based estimation and simulation ofhigh dimensional dynamical systems such as the oceanic or atmospheric flows isproposed.

This paper aims to uncover the underlyingfactors contributing to such performance deterioration when dealing withexpanded state spaces, using a novel analysis technique known as statedivision. In contrast to prior approaches that employ state division merely asa post-hoc explanatory tool, our methodology delves into the intrinsiccharacteristics of DRL policy networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that theexpansion of state space induces the activation function $\tanh$ to exhibitsaturability, resulting in the transformation of the state division boundaryfrom nonlinear to linear. Our analysis centers on the paradigm of thedouble-integrator system, revealing that this gradual shift towards linearityimparts a control behavior reminiscent of bang-bang control. However, theinherent linearity of the division boundary prevents the attainment of an idealbang-bang control, thereby introducing unavoidable overshooting. Ourexperimental investigations, employing diverse RL algorithms, establish thatthis performance phenomenon stems from inherent attributes of the DRL policynetwork, remaining consistent across various optimization algorithms.</description><author>Ruining Zhang, Haoran Han, Maolong Lv, Qisong Yang, Jian Cheng</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 11:05:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10472v2</guid></item><item><title>Hopfield model with planted patterns: a teacher-student self-supervised learning model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13710v3</link><description>While Hopfield networks are known as paradigmatic models for memory storageand retrieval, modern artificial intelligence systems mainly stand on themachine learning paradigm.

Some existing work has applied it in the field ofwildfire recognition or detection. However, we observed that the vanillaTransformer is not friendly for extracting smoke features. Because low-levelinformation such as color, transparency and texture is very important for smokerecognition, and transformer pays more attention to the semantic relevancebetween middle- or high-level features, and is not sensitive to the subtlechanges of low-level features along the space. To solve this problem, wepropose the Cross Contrast Patch Embedding(CCPE) module based on the SwinTransformer, which uses the multi-scales spatial frequency contrast informationin both vertical and horizontal directions to improve the discrimination of thenetwork on the underlying details. The fuzzy boundary of smoke makes thepositive and negative label assignment for instances in a dilemma, which isanother challenge for wildfires detection. To solve this problem, a SeparableNegative Sampling Mechanism(SNSM) is proposed. By using two different negativeinstance sampling strategies on positive images and negative imagesrespectively, the problem of supervision signal confusion caused by labeldiversity in the process of network training is alleviated.

However, they stillsuffer from high computational costs or poor quality of the generated saliencymaps. To solve these problems, we design a space-time memory (STM)-basednetwork, which extracts useful temporal information of the current frame fromadjacent frames as the temporal branch of VSOD. Furthermore, previous methodsonly considered single-frame prediction without temporal association. As aresult, the model may not focus on the temporal information sufficiently. Thus,we initially introduce object motion prediction between inter-frame into VSOD.Our model follows standard encoder--decoder architecture. In the encodingstage, we generate high-level temporal features by using high-level featuresfrom the current and its adjacent frames. This approach is more efficient thanthe optical flow-based methods. In the decoding stage, we propose an effectivefusion strategy for spatial and temporal branches. The semantic information ofthe high-level features is used to fuse the object details in the low-levelfeatures, and then the spatiotemporal features are obtained step by step toreconstruct the saliency maps. Moreover, inspired by the boundary supervisioncommonly used in image salient object detection (ISOD), we design amotion-aware loss for predicting object boundary motion and simultaneouslyperform multitask learning for VSOD and object motion prediction, which canfurther facilitate the model to extract spatiotemporal features accurately andmaintain the object integrity. Extensive experiments on several datasetsdemonstrated the effectiveness of our method and can achieve state-of-the-artmetrics on some datasets. The proposed model does not require optical flow orother preprocessing, and can reach a speed of nearly 100 FPS during inference.</description><author>Xing Zhao, Haoran Liang, Peipei Li, Guodao Sun, Dongdong Zhao, Ronghua Liang, Xiaofei He</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 07:43:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00946v2</guid></item><item><title>Language-Assisted 3D Scene Understanding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11451v2</link><description>The scale and quality of point cloud datasets constrain the advancement ofpoint cloud learning.

Moleculesinherently exist in the real world as three-dimensional structures;furthermore, they are not static but in continuous motion in the 3D Euclideanspace, forming a potential energy surface. Therefore, it is desirable togenerate multiple conformations in advance and extract molecularrepresentations using a 4D-QSAR model that incorporates multiple conformations.However, this approach is impractical for drug and material discovery tasksbecause of the computational cost of obtaining multiple conformations. Toaddress this issue, we propose a pre-training method for molecular GNNs usingan existing dataset of molecular conformations to generate a latent vectoruniversal to multiple conformations from a 2D molecular graph.

While considerable efforts were directedtowards improving pre-text tasks, architectures, or robustness (e.g., Siamesenetworks or teacher-softmax centering), the majority of these methods remainstrongly reliant on the random sampling of operations within the imageaugmentation pipeline, such as the random resized crop or color distortionoperation. In this paper, we argue that the role of the view generation and itseffect on performance has so far received insufficient attention. To addressthis, we propose an easy, learning-free, yet powerful Hard View Selection (HVS)strategy designed to extend the random view generation to expose the pretrainedmodel to harder samples during SSL training. It encompasses the followingiterative steps: 1) randomly sample multiple views and create pairs of twoviews, 2) run forward passes for each view pair on the currently trained model,3) adversarially select the pair yielding the worst loss, and 4) run thebackward pass with the selected pair. In our empirical analysis we show thatunder the hood, HVS increases task difficulty by controlling the Intersectionover Union of views during pretraining. With only 300-epoch pretraining, HVS isable to closely rival the 800-epoch DINO baseline which remains very favorableeven when factoring in the slowdown induced by the additional forwards of HVS.Additionally, HVS consistently achieves accuracy improvements on ImageNetbetween 0.4% and 1.9% on linear evaluation and similar improvements on transfertasks across multiple SSL methods, such as DINO, SimSiam, iBOT, and SimCLR.</description><author>Fabio Ferreira, Ivo Rapant, Frank Hutter</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 05:46:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03940v4</guid></item><item><title>Stochastic Approximation with Decision-Dependent Distributions: Asymptotic Normality and Optimality</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04173v2</link><description>We analyze a stochastic approximation algorithm for decision-dependentproblems, wherein the data distribution used by the algorithm evolves along theiterate sequence.

To understand how models resolve such conflicts, we studyLlama-2-chat models on the forbidden fact task. Specifically, we instructLlama-2 to truthfully complete a factual recall statement while forbidding itfrom saying the correct answer. This often makes the model give incorrectanswers. We decompose Llama-2 into 1000+ components, and rank each one withrespect to how useful it is for forbidding the correct answer. We find that inaggregate, around 35 components are enough to reliably implement the fullsuppression behavior. However, these components are fairly heterogeneous andmany operate using faulty heuristics. We discover that one of these heuristicscan be exploited via a manually designed adversarial attack which we call TheCalifornia Attack.

Such anapproach can be useful in learning the relationship between input and outputwhen the regression parameters for estimating output are different in differentregions of the input space. Variational Inference (VI), a machine learningapproach to obtain posterior probability densities using optimizationtechniques, is used to identify clusters of explanatory variables andregression parameters for each cluster. From these results, one can obtain boththe expected value and the full distribution of predicted output. Otheradvantages of the proposed approach include the elegant theoretical solutionand clear interpretability of results. The proposed approach is well-suited forfinancial forecasting where markets have different regimes (or clusters) withdifferent patterns and correlations of market changes in each regime. Infinancial applications, knowledge about such clusters can provide usefulinsights about portfolio performance and identify the relative importance ofvariables in different market regimes. An illustrative example of predictingone-day S&amp;P change is considered to illustrate the approach and compare theperformance of the proposed approach with standard regression without clusters.Due to the broad applicability of the problem, its elegant theoreticalsolution, and the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm, theapproach may be useful in a number of areas extending beyond the financialdomain.</description><author>Udai Nagpal, Krishan Nagpal</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 04:40:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00605v3</guid></item><item><title>Empower Nested Boolean Logic via Self-Supervised Curriculum Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05450v2</link><description>Beyond the great cognitive powers showcased by language models, it is crucialto scrutinize whether their reasoning capabilities stem from stronggeneralization or merely exposure to relevant data.

We find that any pre-trained language modelseven including large language models only behave like a random selector in theface of multi-nested boolean logic, a task that humans can handle with ease. Toempower language models with this fundamental capability, this paper proposes anew self-supervised learning method \textit{Curriculum Logical Reasoning}(\textsc{Clr}), where we augment the training data with nested boolean logicchain step-by-step, and program the training from simpler logical patternsgradually to harder ones. This new training paradigm allows language models toeffectively generalize to much harder and longer-hop logic, which can hardly belearned through naive training.

Hopkinsamended sampling is adopted to determine the appropriate timing for clusteringand the sampling weight of public unlabeled data. In addition, a simple yeteffective approach is developed to adaptively adjust the personalization layersbased on varying degrees of data skew. Experimental results show that ourproposed method has reliable performance on both IID and non-IID scenarios.</description><author>Hangyu Zhu, Yuxiang Fan, Zhenping Xie</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 01:53:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15821v2</guid></item><item><title>Wave Physics-informed Matrix Factorizations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13584v2</link><description>With the recent success of representation learning methods, which includesdeep learning as a special case, there has been considerable interest indeveloping techniques that incorporate known physical constraints into thelearned representation. As one example, in many applications that involve asignal propagating through physical media (e.g., optics, acoustics, fluiddynamics, etc), it is known that the dynamics of the signal must satisfyconstraints imposed by the wave equation. Here we propose a matrixfactorization technique that decomposes such signals into a sum of components,where each component is regularized to ensure that it {nearly} satisfies waveequation constraints. Although our proposed formulation is non-convex, we provethat our model can be efficiently solved to global optimality. Through thisline of work we establish theoretical connections between wave-informedlearning and filtering theory in signal processing. We further demonstrate theapplication of this work on modal analysis problems commonly arising instructural diagnostics and prognostics.</description><author>Harsha Vardhan Tetali, Joel B.

Generative modelstrained with differential privacy (DP) on sensitive data can sidestep thischallenge, providing access to synthetic data instead. We build on the recentsuccess of diffusion models (DMs) and introduce Differentially PrivateDiffusion Models (DPDMs), which enforce privacy using differentially privatestochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). We investigate the DM parameterizationand the sampling algorithm, which turn out to be crucial ingredients in DPDMs,and propose noise multiplicity, a powerful modification of DP-SGD tailored tothe training of DMs. We validate our novel DPDMs on image generation benchmarksand achieve state-of-the-art performance in all experiments. Moreover, onstandard benchmarks, classifiers trained on DPDM-generated synthetic dataperform on par with task-specific DP-SGD-trained classifiers, which has notbeen demonstrated before for DP generative models.

A common keystep for behavioral analysis is first extracting relevant keypoints on animals,known as pose estimation. However, reliable inference of poses currentlyrequires domain knowledge and manual labeling effort to build supervisedmodels. We present a series of technical innovations that enable a new method,collectively called SuperAnimal, to develop unified foundation models that canbe used on over 45 species, without additional human labels. Concretely, weintroduce a method to unify the keypoint space across differently labeleddatasets (via our generalized data converter) and for training these diversedatasets in a manner such that they don't catastrophically forget keypointsgiven the unbalanced inputs (via our keypoint gradient masking and memoryreplay approaches). These models show excellent performance across six posebenchmarks. Then, to ensure maximal usability for end-users, we demonstrate howto fine-tune the models on differently labeled data and provide tooling forunsupervised video adaptation to boost performance and decrease jitter acrossframes. If the models are fine-tuned, we show SuperAnimal models are10-100$\times$ more data efficient than prior transfer-learning-basedapproaches. We illustrate the utility of our models in behavioralclassification in mice and gait analysis in horses. Collectively, this presentsa data-efficient solution for animal pose estimation.</description><author>Shaokai Ye, Anastasiia Filippova, Jessy Lauer, Steffen Schneider, Maxime Vidal, Tian Qiu, Alexander Mathis, Mackenzie Weygandt Mathis</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 01:17:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07436v4</guid></item><item><title>DiffusionNAG: Predictor-guided Neural Architecture Generation with Diffusion Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16943v2</link><description>Existing NAS methods suffer from either an excessive amount of time forrepetitive sampling and training of many task-irrelevant architectures. Totackle such limitations of existing NAS methods, we propose a paradigm shiftfrom NAS to a novel conditional Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) frameworkbased on diffusion models, dubbed DiffusionNAG. Specifically, we consider theneural architectures as directed graphs and propose a graph diffusion model forgenerating them. Moreover, with the guidance of parameterized predictors,DiffusionNAG can flexibly generate task-optimal architectures with the desiredproperties for diverse tasks, by sampling from a region that is more likely tosatisfy the properties. This conditional NAG scheme is significantly moreefficient than previous NAS schemes which sample the architectures and filterthem using the property predictors. We validate the effectiveness ofDiffusionNAG through extensive experiments in two predictor-based NASscenarios: Transferable NAS and Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based NAS.DiffusionNAG achieves superior performance with speedups of up to 20 times whencompared to the baselines on Transferable NAS benchmarks. Furthermore, whenintegrated into a BO-based algorithm, DiffusionNAG outperforms existingBO-based NAS approaches, particularly in the large MobileNetV3 search space onthe ImageNet 1K dataset.</description><author>Sohyun An, Hayeon Lee, Jaehyeong Jo, Seanie Lee, Sung Ju Hwang</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 00:30:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16943v2</guid></item><item><title>Diffusion-HPC: Synthetic Data Generation for Human Mesh Recovery in Challenging Domains</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09541v2</link><description>Recent text-to-image generative models have exhibited remarkable abilities ingenerating high-fidelity and photo-realistic images.

Due to this reason, while generative modelshave shown promising results in aiding downstream image recognition tasks bygenerating large volumes of synthetic data, they are not suitable for improvingdownstream human pose perception and understanding. In this work, we propose aDiffusion model with Human Pose Correction (Diffusion-HPC), a text-conditionedmethod that generates photo-realistic images with plausible posed humans byinjecting prior knowledge about human body structure. Our generated images areaccompanied by 3D meshes that serve as ground truths for improving Human MeshRecovery tasks, where a shortage of 3D training data has long been an issue.Furthermore, we show that Diffusion-HPC effectively improves the realism ofhuman generations under varying conditioning strategies.</description><author>Zhenzhen Weng, Laura Bravo-Sánchez, Serena Yeung-Levy</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 00:17:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09541v2</guid></item><item><title>Phoneme Hallucinator: One-shot Voice Conversion via Set Expansion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06382v2</link><description>Voice conversion (VC) aims at altering a person's voice to make it soundsimilar to the voice of another person while preserving linguistic content.Existing methods suffer from a dilemma between content intelligibility andspeaker similarity; i.e., methods with higher intelligibility usually have alower speaker similarity, while methods with higher speaker similarity usuallyrequire plenty of target speaker voice data to achieve high intelligibility. Inthis work, we propose a novel method \textit{Phoneme Hallucinator} thatachieves the best of both worlds. Phoneme Hallucinator is a one-shot VC model;it adopts a novel model to hallucinate diversified and high-fidelity targetspeaker phonemes based just on a short target speaker voice (e.g. 3 seconds).The hallucinated phonemes are then exploited to perform neighbor-based voiceconversion. Our model is a text-free, any-to-any VC model that requires no textannotations and supports conversion to any unseen speaker. Objective andsubjective evaluations show that \textit{Phoneme Hallucinator} outperformsexisting VC methods for both intelligibility and speaker similarity.</description><author>Siyuan Shan, Yang Li, Amartya Banerjee, Junier B.

Benefiting from the rapid development ofdeep learning technologies, image-based 3D detection has achieved remarkableprogress. Particularly, more than 200 works have studied this problem from 2015to 2021, encompassing a broad spectrum of theories, algorithms, andapplications. However, to date no recent survey exists to collect and organizethis knowledge. In this paper, we fill this gap in the literature and providethe first comprehensive survey of this novel and continuously growing researchfield, summarizing the most commonly used pipelines for image-based 3Ddetection and deeply analyzing each of their components. Additionally, we alsopropose two new taxonomies to organize the state-of-the-art methods intodifferent categories, with the intent of providing a more systematic review ofexisting methods and facilitating fair comparisons with future works. Inretrospect of what has been achieved so far, we also analyze the currentchallenges in the field and discuss future directions for image-based 3Ddetection research.</description><author>Xinzhu Ma, Wanli Ouyang, Andrea Simonelli, Elisa Ricci</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 22:26:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02980v6</guid></item><item><title>Time is Encoded in the Weights of Finetuned Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13401v2</link><description>We present time vectors, a simple tool to customize language models to newtime periods. Time vectors are created by finetuning a language model on datafrom a single time (e.g., a year or month), and then subtracting the weights ofthe original pretrained model. This vector specifies a direction in weightspace that, as our experiments show, improves performance on text from thattime period. Time vectors specialized to adjacent time periods appear to bepositioned closer together in a manifold. Using this structure, we interpolatebetween time vectors to induce new models that perform better on interveningand future time periods, without any additional training. We demonstrate theconsistency of our findings across different tasks, domains, model sizes, andtime scales.

The problem has becomeeven more important with the widespread adoption of machine-learning techniquesin science, as it underpins the capacity of models to accurately reproducephysical relationships while being consistent with fundamental symmetries andconservation laws. However, some of the descriptors that are commonly used torepresent point clouds -- most notably those based on discretized correlationsof the neighbor density, that underpin most of the existing ML models of matterat the atomic scale -- are unable to distinguish between special arrangementsof particles in three dimensions. This makes it impossible to machine learntheir properties. Atom-density correlations are provably complete in the limitin which they simultaneously describe the mutual relationship between allatoms, which is impractical. We present a novel approach to constructdescriptors of \emph{finite} correlations based on the relative arrangement ofparticle triplets, which can be employed to create symmetry-adapted models withuniversal approximation capabilities, which have the resolution of the neighbordiscretization as the sole convergence parameter. Our strategy is demonstratedon a class of atomic arrangements that are specifically built to defy a broadclass of conventional symmetric descriptors, showcasing its potential foraddressing their limitations.</description><author>Jigyasa Nigam, Sergey N.

Scene graphs provide a highly suitable interfaceto facilitate these applications by abstracting the scene context in a compactmanner. Existing methods, reliant on retrieval from extensive databases orpre-trained shape embeddings, often overlook scene-object and object-objectrelationships, leading to inconsistent results due to their limited generationcapacity. To address this issue, we present CommonScenes, a fully generativemodel that converts scene graphs into corresponding controllable 3D scenes,which are semantically realistic and conform to commonsense. Our pipelineconsists of two branches, one predicting the overall scene layout via avariational auto-encoder and the other generating compatible shapes via latentdiffusion, capturing global scene-object and local inter-object relationshipsin the scene graph while preserving shape diversity. The generated scenes canbe manipulated by editing the input scene graph and sampling the noise in thediffusion model. Due to lacking a scene graph dataset offering high-qualityobject-level meshes with relations, we also construct SG-FRONT, enriching theoff-the-shelf indoor dataset 3D-FRONT with additional scene graph labels.Extensive experiments are conducted on SG-FRONT where CommonScenes shows clearadvantages over other methods regarding generation consistency, quality, anddiversity.

Photonicprocessors that execute operations using photons instead of electrons, havepromised to enable optical neural networks with ultra-low latency and powerconsumption. However, existing optical neural networks, limited by theunderlying network designs, have achieved image recognition accuracy far belowthat of state-of-the-art electronic neural networks. In this work, we closethis gap by embedding massively parallelized optical computation into flatcamera optics that perform neural network computation during the capture,before recording an image on the sensor. Specifically, we harness large kernelsand propose a large-kernel spatially-varying convolutional neural networklearned via low-dimensional reparameterization techniques. We experimentallyinstantiate the network with a flat meta-optical system that encompasses anarray of nanophotonic structures designed to induce angle-dependent responses.Combined with an extremely lightweight electronic backend with approximately 2Kparameters we demonstrate a reconfigurable nanophotonic neural network reaches72.76\% blind test classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset, and, as such,the first time, an optical neural network outperforms the first modern digitalneural network -- AlexNet (72.64\%) with 57M parameters, bringing opticalneural network into modern deep learning era.</description><author>Kaixuan Wei, Xiao Li, Johannes Froech, Praneeth Chakravarthula, James Whitehead, Ethan Tseng, Arka Majumdar, Felix Heide</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 21:44:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03407v3</guid></item><item><title>Symbol tuning improves in-context learning in language models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08298v2</link><description>We present symbol tuning - finetuning language models on in-contextinput-label pairs where natural language labels (e.g., "positive/negativesentiment") are replaced with arbitrary symbols (e.g., "foo/bar").

We experiment with symbol tuning across Flan-PaLM models up to 540Bparameters and observe benefits across various settings. First, symbol tuningboosts performance on unseen in-context learning tasks and is much more robustto underspecified prompts, such as those without instructions or withoutnatural language labels. Second, symbol-tuned models are much stronger atalgorithmic reasoning tasks, with up to 18.2% better performance on the ListFunctions benchmark and up to 15.3% better performance on the Simple TuringConcepts benchmark.

Furthermore, these neuron populations are notmerely passive transmitters. They act as operators within this algebraicstructure, mirroring the functionality of a low-level programming language.When these populations interconnect, they embody succinct yet potent algebraicexpressions. These networks allow them to implement many operations, such asspecialization, generalization, novelty detection, dimensionality reduction,inverse modeling, prediction, and associative memory.

Its general formulationcaptures many real-world problems at the intersection of symbolic andstatistical Artificial Intelligence. SMC searches for policy interventions tocontrol probabilistic outcomes. Solving SMC is challenging because of itshighly intractable nature($\text{NP}^{\text{PP}}$-complete), incorporatingstatistical inference and symbolic reasoning. Previous research on SMC solvinglacks provable guarantees and/or suffers from sub-optimal empiricalperformance, especially when combinatorial constraints are present. We proposeXOR-SMC, a polynomial algorithm with access to NP-oracles, to solve highlyintractable SMC problems with constant approximation guarantees. XOR-SMCtransforms the highly intractable SMC into satisfiability problems, byreplacing the model counting in SMC with SAT formulae subject to randomized XORconstraints. Experiments on solving important SMC problems in AI for socialgood demonstrate that XOR-SMC finds solutions close to the true optimum,outperforming several baselines which struggle to find good approximations forthe intractable model counting in SMC.</description><author>Jinzhao Li, Nan Jiang, Yexiang Xue</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 21:05:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08883v2</guid></item><item><title>Geometry-Aware Approaches for Balancing Performance and Theoretical Guarantees in Linear Bandits</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14872v3</link><description>This paper is motivated by recent research in the $d$-dimensional stochasticlinear bandit literature, which has revealed an unsettling discrepancy:algorithms like Thompson sampling and Greedy demonstrate promising empiricalperformance, yet this contrasts with their pessimistic theoretical regretbounds.

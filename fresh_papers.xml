This technique maintains a queue of videoframes with progressively increasing noise, continuously producing clean framesat the queue's head while Gaussian noise is enqueued at the tail. However,FIFO-Diffusion often struggles to keep long-range temporal consistency in thegenerated videos due to the lack of correspondence modeling across frames. Inthis paper, we propose Ouroboros-Diffusion, a novel video denoising frameworkdesigned to enhance structural and content (subject) consistency, enabling thegeneration of consistent videos of arbitrary length. Specifically, we introducea new latent sampling technique at the queue tail to improve structuralconsistency, ensuring perceptually smooth transitions among frames. To enhancesubject consistency, we devise a Subject-Aware Cross-Frame Attention (SACFA)mechanism, which aligns subjects across frames within short segments to achievebetter visual coherence. Furthermore, we introduce self-recurrent guidance.This technique leverages information from all previous cleaner frames at thefront of the queue to guide the denoising of noisier frames at the end,fostering rich and contextual global information interaction. Extensiveexperiments of long video generation on the VBench benchmark demonstrate thesuperiority of our Ouroboros-Diffusion, particularly in terms of subjectconsistency, motion smoothness, and temporal consistency.</description><author>Jingyuan Chen, Fuchen Long, Jie An, Zhaofan Qiu, Ting Yao, Jiebo Luo, Tao Mei</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:59:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09019v1</guid></item><item><title>T2V-CompBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Compositional Text-to-video Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14505v2</link><description>Text-to-video (T2V) generative models have advanced significantly, yet theirability to compose different objects, attributes, actions, and motions into avideo remains unexplored. Previous text-to-video benchmarks also neglect thisimportant ability for evaluation. In this work, we conduct the first systematicstudy on compositional text-to-video generation. We propose T2V-CompBench, thefirst benchmark tailored for compositional text-to-video generation.T2V-CompBench encompasses diverse aspects of compositionality, includingconsistent attribute binding, dynamic attribute binding, spatial relationships,motion binding, action binding, object interactions, and generative numeracy.We further carefully design evaluation metrics of multimodal large languagemodel (MLLM)-based, detection-based, and tracking-based metrics, which canbetter reflect the compositional text-to-video generation quality of sevenproposed categories with 1400 text prompts. The effectiveness of the proposedmetrics is verified by correlation with human evaluations. We also benchmarkvarious text-to-video generative models and conduct in-depth analysis acrossdifferent models and various compositional categories. We find thatcompositional text-to-video generation is highly challenging for currentmodels, and we hope our attempt could shed light on future research in thisdirection.</description><author>Kaiyue Sun, Kaiyi Huang, Xian Liu, Yue Wu, Zihan Xu, Zhenguo Li, Xihui Liu</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:57:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14505v2</guid></item><item><title>How Do Generative Models Draw a Software Engineer? A Case Study on Stable Diffusion Bias</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09014v1</link><description>Generative models are nowadays widely used to generate graphical content usedfor multiple purposes, e.g. web, art, advertisement. However, it has been shownthat the images generated by these models could reinforce societal biasesalready existing in specific contexts. In this paper, we focus on understandingif this is the case when one generates images related to various softwareengineering tasks. In fact, the Software Engineering (SE) community is notimmune from gender and ethnicity disparities, which could be amplified by theuse of these models. Hence, if used without consciousness, artificiallygenerated images could reinforce these biases in the SE domain. Specifically,we perform an extensive empirical evaluation of the gender and ethnicity biasexposed by three versions of the Stable Diffusion (SD) model (a very popularopen-source text-to-image model) - SD 2, SD XL, and SD 3 - towards SE tasks. Weobtain 6,720 images by feeding each model with two sets of prompts describingdifferent software-related tasks: one set includes the Software Engineerkeyword, and one set does not include any specification of the personperforming the task. Next, we evaluate the gender and ethnicity disparities inthe generated images. Results show how all models are significantly biasedtowards male figures when representing software engineers. On the contrary,while SD 2 and SD XL are strongly biased towards White figures, SD 3 isslightly more biased towards Asian figures. Nevertheless, all modelssignificantly under-represent Black and Arab figures, regardless of the promptstyle used. The results of our analysis highlight severe concerns aboutadopting those models to generate content for SE tasks and open the field forfuture research on bias mitigation in this context.</description><author>Tosin Fadahunsi, Giordano d'Aloisio, Antinisca Di Marco, Federica Sarro</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:57:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09014v1</guid></item><item><title>Multimodal LLMs Can Reason about Aesthetics in Zero-Shot</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09012v1</link><description>We present the first study on how Multimodal LLMs' (MLLMs) reasoning abilityshall be elicited to evaluate the aesthetics of artworks.

Although MLFFFMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods,there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, whileresearch is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transferacross chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset ofsystems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFsrelevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physicalsoundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introducea method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundationmodels to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemicalspace. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, wherethe smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energypredictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be upto 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, andin some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. Wealso show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct forceparameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e.,computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages therepresentations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, whilemaintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamicssimulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFFdevelopment, in which foundation models are released along with smaller,specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.</description><author>Ishan Amin, Sanjeev Raja, Aditi Krishnapriyan</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:50:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09009v1</guid></item><item><title>SimGen: A Diffusion-Based Framework for Simultaneous Surgical Image and Segmentation Mask Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09008v1</link><description>Acquiring and annotating surgical data is often resource-intensive, ethicalconstraining, and requiring significant expert involvement. While generative AImodels like text-to-image can alleviate data scarcity, incorporating spatialannotations, such as segmentation masks, is crucial for precision-drivensurgical applications, simulation, and education. This study introduces both anovel task and method, SimGen, for Simultaneous Image and Mask Generation.SimGen is a diffusion model based on the DDPM framework and Residual U-Net,designed to jointly generate high-fidelity surgical images and theircorresponding segmentation masks. The model leverages cross-correlation priorsto capture dependencies between continuous image and discrete maskdistributions. Additionally, a Canonical Fibonacci Lattice (CFL) is employed toenhance class separability and uniformity in the RGB space of the masks. SimGendelivers high-fidelity images and accurate segmentation masks, outperformingbaselines across six public datasets assessed on image and semantic inceptiondistance metrics. Ablation study shows that the CFL improves mask quality andspatial separation. Downstream experiments suggest generated image-mask pairsare usable if regulations limit human data release for research. This workoffers a cost-effective solution for generating paired surgical images andcomplex labels, advancing surgical AI development by reducing the need forexpensive manual annotations.</description><author>Aditya Bhat, Rupak Bose, Chinedu Innocent Nwoye, Nicolas Padoy</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:48:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09008v1</guid></item><item><title>AI-RAN: Transforming RAN with AI-driven Computing Infrastructure</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09007v1</link><description>The radio access network (RAN) landscape is undergoing a transformative shiftfrom traditional, communication-centric infrastructures towards convergedcompute-communication platforms. This article introduces AI-RAN whichintegrates both RAN and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads on the sameinfrastructure. By doing so, AI-RAN not only meets the performance demands offuture networks but also improves asset utilization. We begin by examining howRANs have evolved beyond mobile broadband towards AI-RAN and articulatingmanifestations of AI-RAN into three forms: AI-for-RAN, AI-on-RAN, andAI-and-RAN. Next, we identify the key requirements and enablers for theconvergence of communication and computing in AI-RAN. We then provide areference architecture for advancing AI-RAN from concept to practice. Toillustrate the practical potential of AI-RAN, we present a proof-of-conceptthat concurrently processes RAN and AI workloads utilizing NVIDIA Grace-HopperGH200 servers. Finally, we conclude the article by outlining future workdirections to guide further developments of AI-RAN.</description><author>Lopamudra Kundu, Xingqin Lin, Rajesh Gadiyar, Jean-Francois Lacasse, Shuvo Chowdhury</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:47:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09007v1</guid></item><item><title>DeblurDiNAT: A Compact Model with Exceptional Generalization and Visual Fidelity on Unseen Domains</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13163v5</link><description>Recent deblurring networks have effectively restored clear images from theblurred ones. However, they often struggle with generalization to unknowndomains. Moreover, these models typically focus on distortion metrics such asPSNR and SSIM, neglecting the critical aspect of metrics aligned with humanperception. To address these limitations, we propose DeblurDiNAT, a deblurringTransformer based on Dilated Neighborhood Attention. First, DeblurDiNAT employsan alternating dilation factor paradigm to capture both local and globalblurred patterns, enhancing generalization and perceptual clarity. Second, alocal cross-channel learner aids the Transformer block to understand theshort-range relationships between adjacent channels. Additionally, we present alinear feed-forward network with a simple while effective design. Finally, adual-stage feature fusion module is introduced as an alternative to theexisting approach, which efficiently process multi-scale visual informationacross network levels. Compared to state-of-the-art models, our compactDeblurDiNAT demonstrates superior generalization capabilities and achievesremarkable performance in perceptual metrics, while maintaining a favorablemodel size.</description><author>Hanzhou Liu, Binghan Li, Chengkai Liu, Mi Lu</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:45:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13163v5</guid></item><item><title>Improving Stability Estimates in Adversarial Explainable AI through Alternate Search Methods</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09006v1</link><description>Advances in the effectiveness of machine learning models have come at thecost of enormous complexity resulting in a poor understanding of how theyfunction. Local surrogate methods have been used to approximate the workings ofthese complex models, but recent work has revealed their vulnerability toadversarial attacks where the explanation produced is appreciably differentwhile the meaning and structure of the complex model's output remains similar.This prior work has focused on the existence of these weaknesses but not ontheir magnitude. Here we explore using an alternate search method with the goalof finding minimum viable perturbations, the fewest perturbations necessary toachieve a fixed similarity value between the original and altered text'sexplanation. Intuitively, a method that requires fewer perturbations to exposea given level of instability is inferior to one which requires more. Thisnuance allows for superior comparisons of the stability of explainabilitymethods.</description><author>Christopher Burger, Charles Walter</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:45:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09006v1</guid></item><item><title>Delay Sensitive Hierarchical Federated Learning with Stochastic Local Updates</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04851v2</link><description>The impact of local averaging on the performance of federated learning (FL)systems is studied in the presence of communication delay between the clientsand the parameter server. To minimize the effect of delay, clients are assignedinto different groups, each having its own local parameter server (LPS) thataggregates its clients' models. The groups' models are then aggregated at aglobal parameter server (GPS) that only communicates with the LPSs. Suchsetting is known as hierarchical FL (HFL). Unlike most works in the literature,the number of local and global communication rounds in our work is randomlydetermined by the (different) delays experienced by each group of clients.Specifically, the number of local averaging rounds is tied to a wall-clock timeperiod coined the sync time $S$, after which the LPSs synchronize their modelsby sharing them with the GPS. Such sync time $S$ is then reapplied until aglobal wall-clock time is exhausted. First, an upper bound on the deviation between the updated model at each LPSwith respect to that available at the GPS is derived. This is then used as atool to derive the convergence analysis of our proposed delay-sensitive HFLalgorithm, first at each LPS individually, and then at the GPS. Our theoreticalconvergence bound showcases the effects of the whole system's parameters,including the number of groups, the number of clients per group, and the valueof $S$. Our results show that the value of $S$ should be carefully chosen,especially since it implicitly governs how the delay statistics affect theperformance of HFL in situations where training time is restricted.</description><author>Abdulmoneam Ali, Ahmed Arafa</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:45:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04851v2</guid></item><item><title>Aegis2.0: A Diverse AI Safety Dataset and Risks Taxonomy for Alignment of LLM Guardrails</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09004v1</link><description>As Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI become increasinglywidespread, concerns about content safety have grown in parallel. Currently,there is a clear lack of high-quality, human-annotated datasets that addressthe full spectrum of LLM-related safety risks and are usable for commercialapplications. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive and adaptabletaxonomy for categorizing safety risks, structured into 12 top-level hazardcategories with an extension to 9 fine-grained subcategories. This taxonomy isdesigned to meet the diverse requirements of downstream users, offering moregranular and flexible tools for managing various risk types. Using a hybriddata generation pipeline that combines human annotations with a multi-LLM"jury" system to assess the safety of responses, we obtain Aegis 2.0, acarefully curated collection of 34,248 samples of human-LLM interactions,annotated according to our proposed taxonomy. To validate its effectiveness, wedemonstrate that several lightweight models, trained using parameter-efficienttechniques on Aegis 2.0, achieve performance competitive with leading safetymodels fully fine-tuned on much larger, non-commercial datasets. In addition,we introduce a novel training blend that combines safety with topic followingdata.This approach enhances the adaptability of guard models, enabling them togeneralize to new risk categories defined during inference. We plan toopen-source Aegis 2.0 data and models to the research community to aid in thesafety guardrailing of LLMs.</description><author>Shaona Ghosh, Prasoon Varshney, Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar, Aishwarya Padmakumar, Traian Rebedea, Jibin Rajan Varghese, Christopher Parisien</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:37:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09004v1</guid></item><item><title>Vision Foundation Models for Computed Tomography</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09001v1</link><description>Foundation models (FMs) have shown transformative potential in radiology byperforming diverse, complex tasks across imaging modalities.

By exposing the underlying structure of a reward function, theyenable the decomposition of an RL task, leading to impressive gains in sampleefficiency. Although Reward Machines and similar formal specifications have arich history of application towards sequential decision-making problems, theycritically rely on a ground-truth interpretation of the domain-specificvocabulary that forms the building blocks of the reward function--suchground-truth interpretations are elusive in the real world due in part topartial observability and noisy sensing. In this work, we explore the use ofReward Machines for Deep RL in noisy and uncertain environments. Wecharacterize this problem as a POMDP and propose a suite of RL algorithms thatexploit task structure under uncertain interpretation of the domain-specificvocabulary. Through theory and experiments, we expose pitfalls in naiveapproaches to this problem while simultaneously demonstrating how taskstructure can be successfully leveraged under noisy interpretations of thevocabulary.</description><author>Andrew C.

However,conventional offline extrinsic calibration methods are cumbersome andtime-consuming as they rely heavily on physical patterns. Additionally, thesemethods primarily focus on short-range areas surrounding the vehicle, resultingin lower calibration quality in more distant zones. To address theselimitations, we propose Click-Calib, a pattern-free approach for offline SVSextrinsic calibration. Without requiring any special setup, the user only needsto click a few keypoints on the ground in natural scenes. Unlike other offlinecalibration approaches, Click-Calib optimizes camera poses over a wide range byminimizing reprojection distance errors of keypoints, thereby achievingaccurate calibrations at both short and long distances. Furthermore,Click-Calib supports both single-frame and multiple-frame modes, with thelatter offering even better results.

However, generating samples withuser-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposesfine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, butthese methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. Inthis work, we propose Feynman Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time frameworkfor steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works bysampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, calledparticles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scorescomputed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined usingrewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high valueindicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore variouschoices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FKsteering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-imagemodels with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8Bparameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on promptfidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusionmodels with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find thatFK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputsand enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our resultsdemonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models, evenwith off-the-shelf rewards, can provide significant sample quality gains andcontrollability benefits.

However, recent research has primarily focused on scaling up modeltraining, while offering limited insights into the direct impact ofrepresentations on the video generation process. In this paper, we initiallyinvestigate the characteristics of features in intermediate layers, findingsubstantial variations in attention maps across different layers. Thesevariations lead to unstable semantic representations and contribute tocumulative differences between features, which ultimately reduce the similaritybetween adjacent frames and negatively affect temporal coherence. To addressthis, we propose RepVideo, an enhanced representation framework fortext-to-video diffusion models. By accumulating features from neighboringlayers to form enriched representations, this approach captures more stablesemantic information. These enhanced representations are then used as inputs tothe attention mechanism, thereby improving semantic expressiveness whileensuring feature consistency across adjacent frames. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate that our RepVideo not only significantly enhances the ability togenerate accurate spatial appearances, such as capturing complex spatialrelationships between multiple objects, but also improves temporal consistencyin video generation.</description><author>Chenyang Si, Weichen Fan, Zhengyao Lv, Ziqi Huang, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:20:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08994v1</guid></item><item><title>Consistency of Responses and Continuations Generated by Large Language Models on Social Media</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08102v2</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in textgeneration, yet their emotional consistency and semantic coherence in socialmedia contexts remain insufficiently understood. This study investigates howLLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships throughcontinuation and response tasks using two open-source models: Gemma and Llama.By analyzing climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examineemotional transitions, intensity patterns, and semantic similarity betweenhuman-authored and LLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while bothmodels maintain high semantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotionalpatterns: Gemma shows a tendency toward negative emotion amplification,particularly anger, while maintaining certain positive emotions like optimism.Llama demonstrates superior emotional preservation across a broader spectrum ofaffects. Both models systematically generate responses with attenuatedemotional intensity compared to human-authored content and show a bias towardpositive emotions in response tasks. Additionally, both models maintain strongsemantic similarity with original texts, though performance varies betweencontinuation and response tasks. These findings provide insights into LLMs'emotional and semantic processing capabilities, with implications for theirdeployment in social media contexts and human-AI interaction design.</description><author>Wenlu Fan, Yuqi Zhu, Chenyang Wang, Bin Wang, Wentao Xu</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:10:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08102v2</guid></item><item><title>Optimal Federated Learning for Functional Mean Estimation under Heterogeneous Privacy Constraints</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18992v2</link><description>Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique designedto preserve data privacy and security, and it has gained significant importancedue to its broad range of applications. This paper addresses the problem ofoptimal functional mean estimation from discretely sampled data in a federatedsetting. We consider a heterogeneous framework where the number of individuals,measurements per individual, and privacy parameters vary across one or moreservers, under both common and independent design settings. In the commondesign setting, the same design points are measured for each individual,whereas in the independent design, each individual has their own randomcollection of design points. Within this framework, we establish minimax upperand lower bounds for the estimation error of the underlying mean function,highlighting the nuanced differences between common and independent designsunder distributed privacy constraints. We propose algorithms that achieve the optimal trade-off between privacy andaccuracy and provide optimality results that quantify the fundamental limits ofprivate functional mean estimation across diverse distributed settings.

Existing studies for learning such ability focus onhuman-object patterns (e.g., contact, spatial relation, orientation) in staticsituations, and learning Human-Object Interaction (HOI) patterns over time(i.e., movement of human and object) is relatively less explored. In thispaper, we introduce a novel type of affordance named Dynamic Affordance. For agiven input 3D object mesh, we learn dynamic affordance which models thedistribution of both (1) human motion and (2) human-guided object pose duringinteractions. As a core idea, we present a method to learn the 3D dynamicaffordance from synthetically generated 2D videos, leveraging a pre-trainedvideo diffusion model. Specifically, we propose a pipeline that first generates2D HOI videos from the 3D object and then lifts them into 3D to generate 4D HOIsamples. Once we generate diverse 4D HOI samples on various target objects, wetrain our DAViD, where we present a method based on the Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA) module for pre-trained human motion diffusion model (MDM) and an objectpose diffusion model with human pose guidance. Our motion diffusion model isextended for multi-object interactions, demonstrating the advantage of ourpipeline with LoRA for combining the concepts of object usage. Throughextensive experiments, we demonstrate our DAViD outperforms the baselines ingenerating human motion with HOIs.</description><author>Hyeonwoo Kim, Sangwon Beak, Hanbyul Joo</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08333v1</guid></item><item><title>MangaNinja: Line Art Colorization with Precise Reference Following</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08332v1</link><description>Derived from diffusion models, MangaNinjia specializes in the task ofreference-guided line art colorization.

This is achieved by just a change in data: wepre-process training videos to yield structured noise. Consequently, our methodis agnostic to diffusion model design, requiring no changes to modelarchitectures or training pipelines. Specifically, we propose a novel noisewarping algorithm, fast enough to run in real time, that replaces randomtemporal Gaussianity with correlated warped noise derived from optical flowfields, while preserving the spatial Gaussianity. The efficiency of ouralgorithm enables us to fine-tune modern video diffusion base models usingwarped noise with minimal overhead, and provide a one-stop solution for a widerange of user-friendly motion control: local object motion control, globalcamera movement control, and motion transfer. The harmonization betweentemporal coherence and spatial Gaussianity in our warped noise leads toeffective motion control while maintaining per-frame pixel quality. Extensiveexperiments and user studies demonstrate the advantages of our method, makingit a robust and scalable approach for controlling motion in video diffusionmodels.

Ingeneral, this condition is not implied by nor implies sublinear regret. Itturns out that gradient equilibrium is achievable by standard online learningmethods such as gradient descent and mirror descent with constant step sizes(rather than decaying step sizes, as is usually required for no regret).Further, as we show through examples, gradient equilibrium translates into aninterpretable and meaningful property in online prediction problems spanningregression, classification, quantile estimation, and others. Notably, we showthat the gradient equilibrium framework can be used to develop a debiasingscheme for black-box predictions under arbitrary distribution shift, based onsimple post hoc online descent updates. We also show that post hoc gradientupdates can be used to calibrate predicted quantiles under distribution shift,and that the framework leads to unbiased Elo scores for pairwise preferenceprediction.</description><author>Anastasios N.

Current video-based hand pose reconstruction methodsprimarily focus on improving frame-wise 3D pose using adjacent frames ratherthan studying consistent 4D hand trajectories in space. Despite the additionaltemporal cues, they generally underperform compared to image-based methods dueto the scarcity of annotated video data. To address these issues, we repurposea state-of-the-art image-based transformer to take in multiple frames anddirectly predict a coherent trajectory. We introduce two types of lightweightattention layers: cross-view self-attention to fuse temporal information, andglobal cross-attention to bring in larger spatial context. Our method infers 4Dhand trajectories similar to the ground truth while maintaining strong 2Dreprojection alignment. We apply the method to both egocentric and allocentricvideos.

As LLMs excel in traditional NLPtasks, their application to complex, strategic games like poker poses a newchallenge. Poker, an incomplete information game, demands a multitude of skillssuch as mathematics, reasoning, planning, strategy, and a deep understanding ofgame theory and human psychology. This makes Poker the ideal next frontier forlarge language models. PokerBench consists of a comprehensive compilation of11,000 most important scenarios, split between pre-flop and post-flop play,developed in collaboration with trained poker players. We evaluate prominentmodels including GPT-4, ChatGPT 3.5, and various Llama and Gemma series models,finding that all state-of-the-art LLMs underperform in playing optimal poker.However, after fine-tuning, these models show marked improvements. We validatePokerBench by having models with different scores compete with each other,demonstrating that higher scores on PokerBench lead to higher win rates inactual poker games. Through gameplay between our fine-tuned model and GPT-4, wealso identify limitations of simple supervised fine-tuning for learning optimalplaying strategy, suggesting the need for more advanced methodologies foreffectively training language models to excel in games. PokerBench thuspresents a unique benchmark for a quick and reliable evaluation of thepoker-playing ability of LLMs as well as a comprehensive benchmark to study theprogress of LLMs in complex game-playing scenarios.

These descriptions are derived usinginputs that activate the feature, which may be a dimension or a direction inthe model's representation space. However, identifying activating inputs iscostly, and the mechanistic role of a feature in model behavior is determinedboth by how inputs cause a feature to activate and by how feature activationaffects outputs. Using steering evaluations, we reveal that current pipelinesprovide descriptions that fail to capture the causal effect of the feature onoutputs. To fix this, we propose efficient, output-centric methods forautomatically generating feature descriptions. These methods use the tokensweighted higher after feature stimulation or the highest weight tokens afterapplying the vocabulary "unembedding" head directly to the feature. Ouroutput-centric descriptions better capture the causal effect of a feature onmodel outputs than input-centric descriptions, but combining the two leads tothe best performance on both input and output evaluations. Lastly, we show thatoutput-centric descriptions can be used to find inputs that activate featurespreviously thought to be "dead".</description><author>Yoav Gur-Arieh, Roy Mayan, Chen Agassy, Atticus Geiger, Mor Geva</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:53:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08319v1</guid></item><item><title>A Similarity Measure Between Functions with Applications to Statistical Learning and Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08317v1</link><description>In this note, we present a novel measure of similarity between two functions.It quantifies how the sub-optimality gaps of two functions convert to eachother, and unifies several existing notions of functional similarity.

Monte Carlo Dropout is awidely used technique for approximating predictive uncertainty by performingstochastic forward passes with dropout during inference. However, using staticdropout rates across all layers and inputs can lead to suboptimal uncertaintyestimates, as it fails to adapt to the varying characteristics of individualinputs and network layers. Existing approaches optimize dropout rates duringtraining using labeled data, resulting in fixed inference-time parameters thatcannot adjust to new data distributions, compromising uncertainty estimates inMonte Carlo simulations. In this paper, we propose Rate-In, an algorithm that dynamically adjustsdropout rates during inference by quantifying the information loss induced bydropout in each layer's feature maps. By treating dropout as controlled noiseinjection and leveraging information-theoretic principles, Rate-In adaptsdropout rates per layer and per input instance without requiring ground truthlabels. By quantifying the functional information loss in feature maps, weadaptively tune dropout rates to maintain perceptual quality across diversemedical imaging tasks and architectural configurations. Our extensive empiricalstudy on synthetic data and real-world medical imaging tasks demonstrates thatRate-In improves calibration and sharpens uncertainty estimates compared tofixed or heuristic dropout rates without compromising predictive performance.Rate-In offers a practical, unsupervised, inference-time approach to optimizingdropout for more reliable predictive uncertainty estimation in criticalapplications.</description><author>Tal Zeevi, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, Yann LeCun, Lawrence H.

These variants are developed and evaluated witha standardized data pipeline and training/validation/testing strategy on 26widely-used suspensor MTSC datasets.

The availability of public Wi-Fi networks hasfacilitated a vast variety of online content, including social mediaapplications. Although anonymity and ease of access can be a convenient meansof communication for their users, it is difficult to manage and protect itsvulnerable users against sexual predators. Using an automated identificationsystem that can attribute predators to their text would make the solution moreattainable. In this survey, we provide a review of the methods of pedophileattribution used in social media platforms. We examine the effect of the sizeof the suspect set and the length of the text on the task of attribution.Moreover, we review the most-used datasets, features, classification techniquesand performance measures for attributing sexual predators. We found that fewstudies have proposed tools to mitigate the risk of online sexual predators,but none of them can provide suspect attribution. Finally, we list several openresearch problems.</description><author>Hiba Fallatah, Ching Suen, Olga Ormandjieva</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:25:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08296v1</guid></item><item><title>LayerAnimate: Layer-specific Control for Animation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08295v1</link><description>Animated video separates foreground and background elements into layers, withdistinct processes for sketching, refining, coloring, and in-betweening.Existing video generation methods typically treat animation as a monolithicdata domain, lacking fine-grained control over individual layers. In thispaper, we introduce LayerAnimate, a novel architectural approach that enhancesfine-grained control over individual animation layers within a video diffusionmodel, allowing users to independently manipulate foreground and backgroundelements in distinct layers. To address the challenge of limited layer-specificdata, we propose a data curation pipeline that features automated elementsegmentation, motion-state hierarchical merging, and motion coherencerefinement. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, and user study,we demonstrate that LayerAnimate outperforms current methods in terms ofanimation quality, control precision, and usability, making it an ideal toolfor both professional animators and amateur enthusiasts. This framework opensup new possibilities for layer-specific animation applications and creativeflexibility.

To address this gap, we introduce Gaussian Eigen Models (GEM), whichprovide high-quality, lightweight, and easily controllable head avatars. GEMutilizes 3D Gaussian primitives for representing the appearance combined withGaussian splatting for rendering. Building on the success of mesh-based 3Dmorphable face models (3DMM), we define GEM as an ensemble of linear eigenbasesfor representing the head appearance of a specific subject. In particular, weconstruct linear bases to represent the position, scale, rotation, and opacityof the 3D Gaussians. This allows us to efficiently generate Gaussian primitivesof a specific head shape by a linear combination of the basis vectors, onlyrequiring a low-dimensional parameter vector that contains the respectivecoefficients. We propose to construct these linear bases (GEM) by distillinghigh-quality compute-intense CNN-based Gaussian avatar models that can generateexpression-dependent appearance changes like wrinkles. These high-qualitymodels are trained on multi-view videos of a subject and are distilled using aseries of principal component analyses. Once we have obtained the bases thatrepresent the animatable appearance space of a specific human, we learn aregressor that takes a single RGB image as input and predicts thelow-dimensional parameter vector that corresponds to the shown facialexpression. In a series of experiments, we compare GEM's self-reenactment andcross-person reenactment results to state-of-the-art 3D avatar methods,demonstrating GEM's higher visual quality and better generalization to newexpressions.</description><author>Wojciech Zielonka, Timo Bolkart, Thabo Beeler, Justus Thies</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:20:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04545v2</guid></item><item><title>HALoGEN: Fantastic LLM Hallucinations and Where to Find Them</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08292v1</link><description>Despite their impressive ability to generate high-quality and fluent text,generative large language models (LLMs) also produce hallucinations: statementsthat are misaligned with established world knowledge or provided input context.However, measuring hallucination can be challenging, as having humans verifymodel generations on-the-fly is both expensive and time-consuming. In thiswork, we release HALoGEN, a comprehensive hallucination benchmark consistingof: (1) 10,923 prompts for generative models spanning nine domains includingprogramming, scientific attribution, and summarization, and (2) automatichigh-precision verifiers for each use case that decompose LLM generations intoatomic units, and verify each unit against a high-quality knowledge source. Weuse this framework to evaluate ~150,000 generations from 14 language models,finding that even the best-performing models are riddled with hallucinations(sometimes up to 86% of generated atomic facts depending on the domain). Wefurther define a novel error classification for LLM hallucinations based onwhether they likely stem from incorrect recollection of training data (Type Aerrors), or incorrect knowledge in training data (Type B errors), or arefabrication (Type C errors).

For instance, consider a stochastic realization, $x$,generated from the addition or multiplication of two stochastic signals $a$ and$b$, namely $x=a+b$ or $x = ab$. For the $x=a+b$ example, $a$ can befluorescence background and $b$ the signal of interest whose statistics are tobe learned from the measured $x$. Similarly, when writing $x=ab$, $a$ can bethought of as the illumination intensity and $b$ the density of fluorescentmolecules of interest. Yet dividing or subtracting stochastic signals amplifiesnoise, and we ask instead whether, using the statistics of $a$ and themeasurement of $x$ as input, we can recover the statistics of $b$. Here, weshow how normalizing flows can generate an approximation of the probabilitydistribution over $b$, thereby avoiding subtraction or division altogether.This method is implemented in our software package, NFdeconvolve, available onGitHub with a tutorial linked in the main text.</description><author>Pedro Pessoa, Max Schweiger, Lance W.

These spoofing attacks ofteninvolve unique 3D structures, such as printed papers or mobile device screens.Although stereo-depth cameras can detect such attacks effectively, theirhigh-cost limits their widespread adoption. Conversely, two-sensor systemswithout extrinsic calibration offer a cost-effective alternative but are unableto calculate depth using stereo techniques. In this work, we propose a methodto overcome this challenge by leveraging facial attributes to derive disparityinformation and estimate relative depth for anti-spoofing purposes, usingnon-calibrated systems. We introduce a multi-modal anti-spoofing model, coinedDisparity Model, that incorporates created disparity maps as a third modalityalongside the two original sensor modalities. We demonstrate the effectivenessof the Disparity Model in countering various spoof attacks using acomprehensive dataset collected from the Intel RealSense ID Solution F455. Ourmethod outperformed existing methods in the literature, achieving an EqualError Rate (EER) of 1.71% and a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 2.77% at a FalsePositive Rate (FPR) of 1%. These errors are lower by 2.45% and 7.94% than theerrors of the best comparison method, respectively. Additionally, we introducea model ensemble that addresses 3D spoof attacks as well, achieving an EER of2.04% and an FNR of 3.83% at an FPR of 1%. Overall, our work provides astate-of-the-art solution for the challenging task of anti-spoofing innon-calibrated systems that lack depth information.</description><author>Ariel Larey, Eyal Rond, Omer Achrack</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:03:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24031v2</guid></item><item><title>VINGS-Mono: Visual-Inertial Gaussian Splatting Monocular SLAM in Large Scenes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08286v1</link><description>VINGS-Mono is a monocular (inertial) Gaussian Splatting (GS) SLAM frameworkdesigned for large scenes. The framework comprises four main components: VIOFront End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIOFront End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment anduncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on thisoutput, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussianmap. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer,Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speedand localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scaleurban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure globalconsistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, whichinnovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of GaussianSplatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map.Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence ofdynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoorand outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localizationperformance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recentGS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods interms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile appand verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in realtime using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the bestof our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM methodcapable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scalelarge scenes.</description><author>Ke Wu, Zicheng Zhang, Muer Tie, Ziqing Ai, Zhongxue Gan, Wenchao Ding</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:01:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08286v1</guid></item><item><title>Can Bayesian Neural Networks Explicitly Model Input Uncertainty?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08285v1</link><description>Inputs to machine learning models can have associated noise or uncertainties,but they are often ignored and not modelled.

This challenge stems from twokey issues: first, incorporating spatial-temporal localization introduces avast number of coordinate combinations, complicating the alignment oflinguistic and visual coordinate representations; second, encoding fine-grainedtemporal and spatial information during video feature compression is inherentlydifficult. To address these issues, we propose LLaVA-ST, a MLLM forfine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. In LLaVA-ST, we proposeLanguage-Aligned Positional Embedding, which embeds the textual coordinatespecial token into the visual space, simplifying the alignment of fine-grainedspatial-temporal correspondences. Additionally, we design the Spatial-TemporalPacker, which decouples the feature compression of temporal and spatialresolutions into two distinct point-to-region attention processing streams.Furthermore, we propose ST-Align dataset with 4.3M training samples forfine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. With ST-align, wepresent a progressive training pipeline that aligns the visual and textualfeature through sequential coarse-to-fine stages.Additionally, we introduce anST-Align benchmark to evaluate spatial-temporal interleaved fine-grainedunderstanding tasks, which include Spatial-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) ,Event Localization and Captioning (ELC) and Spatial Video Grounding (SVG).LLaVA-ST achieves outstanding performance on 11 benchmarks requiringfine-grained temporal, spatial, or spatial-temporal interleaving multimodalunderstanding.

Inparticular, interpretability has become increasingly essential for applicationsthat demand high safety and knowledge rigor, such as drug discovery, autonomousdriving, and genomics. However, progress in understanding even the simplestdeep neural networks - such as fully connected networks - has been limited,despite their role as foundational elements in state-of-the-art models likeResNet and Transformer. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducingNeuroLogic, a novel approach for decoding interpretable logic rules from neuralnetworks. NeuroLogic leverages neural activation patterns to capture themodel's critical decision-making processes, translating them into logical rulesrepresented by hidden predicates. Thanks to its flexible design in thegrounding phase, NeuroLogic can be adapted to a wide range of neural networks.For simple fully connected neural networks, hidden predicates can be groundedin certain split patterns of original input features to derivedecision-tree-like rules. For large, complex vision neural networks, NeuroLogicgrounds hidden predicates into high-level visual concepts that areunderstandable to humans. Our empirical study demonstrates that NeuroLogic canextract global and interpretable rules from state-of-the-art models such asResNet, a task at which existing work struggles. We believe NeuroLogic can helppave the way for understanding the black-box nature of neural networks.</description><author>Chuqin Geng, Xiaojie Xu, Zhaoyue Wang, Ziyu Zhao, Xujie Si</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:57:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08281v1</guid></item><item><title>SmartEraser: Remove Anything from Images using Masked-Region Guidance</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08279v1</link><description>Object removal has so far been dominated by the mask-and-inpaint paradigm,where the masked region is excluded from the input, leaving models relying onunmasked areas to inpaint the missing region. However, this approach lackscontextual information for the masked area, often resulting in unstableperformance. In this work, we introduce SmartEraser, built with a new removingparadigm called Masked-Region Guidance. This paradigm retains the masked regionin the input, using it as guidance for the removal process. It offers severaldistinct advantages: (a) it guides the model to accurately identify the objectto be removed, preventing its regeneration in the output; (b) since the usermask often extends beyond the object itself, it aids in preserving thesurrounding context in the final result. Leveraging this new paradigm, wepresent Syn4Removal, a large-scale object removal dataset, where instancesegmentation data is used to copy and paste objects onto images as removaltargets, with the original images serving as ground truths. Experimentalresults demonstrate that SmartEraser significantly outperforms existingmethods, achieving superior performance in object removal, especially incomplex scenes with intricate compositions.</description><author>Longtao Jiang, Zhendong Wang, Jianmin Bao, Wengang Zhou, Dongdong Chen, Lei Shi, Dong Chen, Houqiang Li</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:55:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08279v1</guid></item><item><title>Efficient Distribution Matching of Representations via Noise-Injected Deep InfoMax</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06993v2</link><description>Deep InfoMax (DIM) is a well-established method for self-supervisedrepresentation learning (SSRL) based on maximization of the mutual informationbetween the input and the output of a deep neural network encoder.

Motivated by the importance of DM toseveral downstream tasks (including generative modeling, disentanglement,outliers detection and other), we enhance DIM to enable automatic matching oflearned representations to a selected prior distribution. To achieve this, wepropose injecting an independent noise into the normalized outputs of theencoder, while keeping the same InfoMax training objective. We show that suchmodification allows for learning uniformly and normally distributedrepresentations, as well as representations of other absolutely continuousdistributions.

Many works have proposed robustness evaluationmeasures for local adversarial attacks, but we need globally robust modelsunbiased to different language styles. We take a broader approach to explore awider range of variations across sociodemographic dimensions to performstructured reliability tests on the reasoning capacity of language models. Weextend the SocialIQA dataset to create diverse paraphrased sets conditioned onsociodemographic styles. The assessment aims to provide a deeper understandingof LLMs in (a) their capability of generating demographic paraphrases withengineered prompts and (b) their reasoning capabilities in real-world, complexlanguage scenarios. We also explore measures such as perplexity,explainability, and ATOMIC performance of paraphrases for fine-grainedreliability analysis of LLMs on these sets.

This diverges from the prevalent practice ofexpanding memory banks to accommodate extensive historical information. Ourspecially designed "memory deciphering" study offers a pivotal insightunderpinning such a strategy: expanding memory banks, while seeminglybeneficial, actually increases the difficulty for VOS modules to decoderelevant features due to the confusion from redundant information. Byrestricting memory banks to a limited number of essential frames, we achieve anotable improvement in VOS accuracy. This process balances the importance andfreshness of frames to maintain an informative memory bank within a boundedcapacity. Additionally, restricted memory banks reduce the training-inferencediscrepancy in memory lengths compared with continuous expansion. This fostersnew opportunities in temporal reasoning and enables us to introduce thepreviously overlooked "temporal positional embedding." Finally, our insightsare embodied in "RMem" ("R" for restricted), a simple yet effective VOSmodification that excels at challenging VOS scenarios and establishes new stateof the art for object state changes (on the VOST dataset) and long videos (onthe Long Videos dataset).

However, in manyreal-world scenarios, clients act as rational players with individualobjectives and strategic behaviors, a concept that existing FL frameworks arenot equipped to adequately address. To bridge this gap, we introduceMultiplayer Federated Learning (MpFL), a novel framework that models theclients in the FL environment as players in a game-theoretic context, aiming toreach an equilibrium. In this scenario, each player tries to optimize their ownutility function, which may not align with the collective goal. Within MpFL, wepropose Per-Player Local Stochastic Gradient Descent (PEARL-SGD), an algorithmin which each player/client performs local updates independently andperiodically communicates with other players. We theoretically analyzePEARL-SGD and prove that it reaches a neighborhood of equilibrium with lesscommunication in the stochastic setup compared to its non-local counterpart.Finally, we verify our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</description><author>TaeHo Yoon, Sayantan Choudhury, Nicolas Loizou</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:23:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08263v1</guid></item><item><title>CriSPO: Multi-Aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided Automatic Prompt Optimization for Text Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02748v3</link><description>Existing automatic prompt engineering methods are typically designed fordiscriminative tasks, where new task prompts are iteratively refined withlimited feedback from a single metric reflecting a single aspect. However,these approaches are suboptimal for generative tasks, which require morenuanced guidance beyond a single numeric metric to improve the prompt andoptimize multiple aspects of the generated text. To address these challenges,we propose a novel multi-aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided automatic PromptOptimization (CriSPO) approach. CriSPO introduces a critique-suggestion moduleas its core component. This module spontaneously discovers aspects, andcompares generated and reference texts across these aspects, providing specificsuggestions for prompt modification. These clear critiques and actionablesuggestions guide a receptive optimizer module to make more substantialchanges, exploring a broader and more effective search space. To furtherimprove CriSPO with multi-metric optimization, we introduce an Automatic SuffixTuning (AST) extension to enhance the performance of task prompts acrossmultiple metrics. We evaluate CriSPO on 4 state-of-the-art LLMs across 4summarization and 5 QA datasets. Extensive experiments show 3-4% ROUGE scoreimprovement on summarization and substantial improvement of various metrics onQA.

However,these techniques often struggle to adapt behavior to new preferences or changesin the environment. To address these limitations, we propose Fine-tuningDiffusion Policy with Human Preference (FDPP). FDPP learns a reward functionthrough preference-based learning. This reward is then used to fine-tune thepre-trained policy with reinforcement learning (RL), resulting in alignment ofpre-trained policy with new human preferences while still solving the originaltask. Our experiments across various robotic tasks and preferences demonstratethat FDPP effectively customizes policy behavior without compromisingperformance. Additionally, we show that incorporating Kullback-Leibler (KL)regularization during fine-tuning prevents over-fitting and helps maintain thecompetencies of the initial policy.</description><author>Yuxin Chen, Devesh K.

Given that previous studies have considered using projectors to applyadversarial attacks, we raise the following question: can adversarial learning(i.e., patch generation) be performed entirely in the physical domain with aprojector? In this work, we propose the Physical-domain Adversarial PatchLearning Augmentation (PAPLA) framework, a novel end-to-end (E2E) frameworkthat converts adversarial learning from the digital domain to the physicaldomain using a projector. We evaluate PAPLA across multiple scenarios,including controlled laboratory settings and realistic outdoor environments,demonstrating its ability to ensure attack success compared to conventionaldigital learning-physical application (DL-PA) methods. We also analyze theimpact of environmental factors, such as projection surface color, projectorstrength, ambient light, distance, and angle of the target object relative tothe camera, on the effectiveness of projected patches. Finally, we demonstratethe feasibility of the attack against a parked car and a stop sign in areal-world outdoor environment. Our results show that under specificconditions, E2E adversarial learning in the physical domain eliminates thetransferability issue and ensures evasion by object detectors. Finally, weprovide insights into the challenges and opportunities of applying adversariallearning in the physical domain and explain where such an approach is moreeffective than using a sticker.</description><author>Dudi Biton, Jacob Shams, Koda Satoru, Asaf Shabtai, Yuval Elovici, Ben Nassi</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:10:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08258v1</guid></item><item><title>Automated Detection and Analysis of Minor Deformations in Flat Walls Due to Railway Vibrations Using LiDAR and Machine Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06457v2</link><description>This study introduces an advanced methodology for automatically identifyingminor deformations in flat walls caused by vibrations from nearby railwaytracks. It leverages high-density Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) LiDAR surveysand AI/ML techniques to collect and analyze data. The scan data is processedinto a detailed point cloud, which is segmented to distinguish ground points,trees, buildings, and other objects. The analysis focuses on identifyingsections along flat walls and estimating their deformations relative to theground orientation. Findings from the study, conducted at the RGIPT campus, reveal significantdeformations in walls close to the railway corridor, with the highestdeformations ranging from 7 to 8 cm and an average of 3 to 4 cm. In contrast,walls further from the corridor show negligible deformations. The developedautomated process for feature extraction and deformation monitoringdemonstrates potential for structural health monitoring. By integrating LiDARdata with machine learning, the methodology provides an efficient system foridentifying and analyzing structural deformations, highlighting the importanceof continuous monitoring for ensuring structural integrity and public safety inurban infrastructure.

Existing autoencodermodels have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compressionratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy forhigh spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge byintroducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design ourmodels to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features toalleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders;(2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phasestraining strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of highspatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve theautoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining thereconstruction quality.

For example, on ImageNet512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedupon H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widelyused SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

Withtheir expanded context windows, LCLMs can process entire knowledge bases andperform retrieval and reasoning directly -- a capability we define asIn-Context Retrieval and Reasoning (ICR^2). However, existing benchmarks likeLOFT often overestimate LCLM performance by providing overly simplifiedcontexts. To address this, we introduce ICR^2, a benchmark that evaluates LCLMsin more realistic scenarios by including confounding passages retrieved withstrong retrievers. We then propose three methods to enhance LCLM performance:(1) retrieve-then-generate fine-tuning, (2) retrieval-attention-probing, whichuses attention heads to filter and de-noise long contexts during decoding, and(3) joint retrieval head training alongside the generation head. Our evaluationof five well-known LCLMs on LOFT and ICR^2 demonstrates significant gains withour best approach applied to Mistral-7B: +17 and +15 points by Exact Match onLOFT, and +13 and +2 points on ICR^2, compared to vanilla RAG and supervisedfine-tuning, respectively.

Additionally, it often lacks sufficient labeleddata for specific tasks requiring significant annotation effort. ContinualLearning (CL) tackles adaptability and generalizability by enabling lifelonglearning from a data stream while mitigating forgetting of previously learnedknowledge. Active Learning (AL) reduces the number of required annotations foreffective training. This work explores both approaches (CAL) to develop a novelframework for robust medical image analysis. Based on the automatic recognitionof shifts in image characteristics, Replay-Base Architecture for ContextAdaptation (RBACA) employs a CL rehearsal method to continually learn fromdiverse contexts, and an AL component to select the most informative instancesfor annotation. A novel approach to evaluate CAL methods is established using adefined metric denominated IL-Score, which allows for the simultaneousassessment of transfer learning, forgetting, and final model performance. Weshow that RBACA works in domain and class-incremental learning scenarios, byassessing its IL-Score on the segmentation and diagnosis of cardiac images.

An effective strategy to mitigate the COVID-19pandemic involves integrating testing to identify infected individuals. WhileRT-PCR is considered the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19, it has somelimitations such as the risk of false negatives. To address this problem, thispaper introduces a novel Deep Learning Diagnosis System that integratespre-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) within an ensemblelearning framework to achieve precise identification of COVID-19 cases fromChest X-ray (CXR) images.

Specifically,we introduce FramePainter as an efficient instantiation of this formulation.Initialized with Stable Video Diffusion, it only uses a lightweight sparsecontrol encoder to inject editing signals. Considering the limitations oftemporal attention in handling large motion between two frames, we furtherpropose matching attention to enlarge the receptive field while encouragingdense correspondence between edited and source image tokens. We highlight theeffectiveness and efficiency of FramePainter across various of editing signals:it domainantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with far lesstraining data, achieving highly seamless and coherent editing of images, \eg,automatically adjust the reflection of the cup. Moreover, FramePainter alsoexhibits exceptional generalization in scenarios not present in real-worldvideos, \eg, transform the clownfish into shark-like shape.

Considering the clearadvantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in optimizing decision-makingprocesses, researchers have delved into the development of Multi-Objective RL(MORL) methods for solving multi-objective decision problems. However, previousmethods either cannot obtain the entire Pareto front, or employ only a singlepolicy network for all the preferences over multiple objectives, which may notproduce personalized solutions for each preference. To address theselimitations, we propose a novel decomposition-based framework for MORL, ParetoSet Learning for MORL (PSL-MORL), that harnesses the generation capability ofhypernetwork to produce the parameters of the policy network for eachdecomposition weight, generating relatively distinct policies for variousscalarized subproblems with high efficiency. PSL-MORL is a general framework,which is compatible for any RL algorithm. The theoretical result guarantees thesuperiority of the model capacity of PSL-MORL and the optimality of theobtained policy network. Through extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks,we demonstrate the effectiveness of PSL-MORL in achieving dense coverage of thePareto front, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art MORL methods in thehypervolume and sparsity indicators.</description><author>Erlong Liu, Yu-Chang Wu, Xiaobin Huang, Chengrui Gao, Ren-Jian Wang, Ke Xue, Chao Qian</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 16:08:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06773v2</guid></item><item><title>Big Batch Bayesian Active Learning by Considering Predictive Probabilities</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08223v1</link><description>We observe that BatchBALD, a popular acquisition function for batch Bayesianactive learning for classification, can conflate epistemic and aleatoricuncertainty, leading to suboptimal performance.

Planning an optimal linkconfiguration is extremely complex and depends on many parameters and metrics.The optimal use of the limited resources, bandwidth and power of thetransponder is crucial. Such an optimization problem can be approximated usingmetaheuristic methods such as simulated annealing, but recent research resultsalso show that reinforcement learning can achieve comparable or even betterperformance in optimization methods. However, there have not yet been anystudies on link configuration on satellite transponders. In order to close thisresearch gap, a transponder environment was developed as part of this work. Forthis environment, the performance of the reinforcement learning algorithm PPOwas compared with the metaheuristic simulated annealing in two experiments. Theresults show that Simulated Annealing delivers better results for this staticproblem than the PPO algorithm, however, the research in turn also underlinesthe potential of reinforcement learning for optimization problems.</description><author>Tobias Rohe, Michael Kölle, Jan Matheis, Rüdiger Höpfl, Leo Sünkel, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 16:04:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08220v1</guid></item><item><title>Investigating Energy Efficiency and Performance Trade-offs in LLM Inference Across Tasks and DVFS Settings</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08219v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant improvements in manynatural language processing (NLP) tasks, accelerating their rapid adoptionacross many industries. These models are resource-intensive, requiringextensive computational resources both during training and inference, leadingto increased energy consumption and negative environmental impact. As theiradoption accelerates, the sustainability of LLMs has become a critical issue,necessitating strategies to optimize their runtime efficiency withoutcompromising performance. Hence, it is imperative to identify the parametersthat significantly influence the performance and energy efficiency of LLMs. Tothat end, in this work, we investigate the effect of important parameters onthe performance and energy efficiency of LLMs during inference and examinetheir trade-offs. First, we analyze how different types of models with varying numbers ofparameters and architectures perform on tasks like text generation, questionanswering, and summarization by benchmarking LLMs such as Falcon-7B,Mistral-7B-v0.1, T5-3B, GPT-2, GPT-J-6B, and GPT-Neo-2.7B. Second, we studyinput and output sequence characteristics such as sequence length concerningenergy consumption, performance, and throughput. Finally, we explore the impactof hardware-based power-saving techniques, i.e., Dynamic Voltage FrequencyScaling (DVFS), on the models' latency and energy efficiency. Our extensivebenchmarking and statistical analysis reveal many interesting findings,uncovering how specific optimizations can reduce energy consumption whilemaintaining throughput and accuracy.

Nevertheless, LLMs are neitherinterpretable nor reliable. To solve the dichotomy between LLMs and SKGs weenvision Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) that combines the benefits of the twoworlds. LAG uses LLMs as Reactive Continuous Knowledge Graphs that can generatepotentially infinite relations and tacit knowledge on-demand. SKGs are key forinjecting a discrete heuristic dimension with clear logical and factualboundaries. We exemplify LAG in two tasks of collective intelligence, i.e.,medical diagnostics and climate projections.

Using clinical human evaluations of responses isexpensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterativedevelopment of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID -an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveragingRAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy(RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, isdesigned to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to theknowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate ourtriad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to anLLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highestvolume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions foremergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstratethat CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existingdefinitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluationusing our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinicianassessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, usingnine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agreewith human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use inLLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts anddatasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for furtherresearch and development.</description><author>Mohita Chowdhury, Yajie Vera He, Aisling Higham, Ernest Lim</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 15:46:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08208v1</guid></item><item><title>Modeling Feature Maps for Quantum Machine Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08205v1</link><description>Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers significant potential for complex taskslike genome sequence classification, but quantum noise on NoisyIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices poses practical challenges.

Withthe most common variational objective function, known as the evidence lowerbound (ELBO), only convergence to a local optimum can be guaranteed. In thiswork, we instead establish the global convergence of a particular VI method.This VI method, which may be considered an instance of neural posteriorestimation (NPE), minimizes an expectation of the inclusive (forward) KLdivergence to fit a variational distribution that is parameterized by a neuralnetwork. Our convergence result relies on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) tocharacterize the gradient dynamics that arise from considering the variationalobjective in function space. In the asymptotic regime of a fixed,positive-definite neural tangent kernel, we establish conditions under whichthe variational objective admits a unique solution in a reproducing kernelHilbert space (RKHS). Then, we show that the gradient descent dynamics infunction space converge to this unique function. In ablation studies andpractical problems, we demonstrate that our results explain the behavior of NPEin non-asymptotic finite-neuron settings, and show that NPE outperformsELBO-based optimization, which often converges to shallow local optima.</description><author>Declan McNamara, Jackson Loper, Jeffrey Regier</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 15:36:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08201v1</guid></item><item><title>Relaxed Rotational Equivariance via $G$-Biases in Vision</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12454v3</link><description>Group Equivariant Convolution (GConv) can capture rotational equivariancefrom original data.

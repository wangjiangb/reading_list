However, creating temporally consistent andrealistic textures for mesh sequences remains labor-intensive for professionalartists. On the other hand, while video diffusion models excel at text-drivenvideo generation, they often lack 3D geometry awareness and struggle withachieving multi-view consistent texturing for 3D meshes. In this work, wepresent Tex4D, a zero-shot approach that integrates inherent 3D geometryknowledge from mesh sequences with the expressiveness of video diffusion modelsto produce multi-view and temporally consistent 4D textures. Given anuntextured mesh sequence and a text prompt as inputs, our method enhancesmulti-view consistency by synchronizing the diffusion process across differentviews through latent aggregation in the UV space. To ensure temporalconsistency, we leverage prior knowledge from a conditional video generationmodel for texture synthesis. However, straightforwardly combining the videodiffusion model and the UV texture aggregation leads to blurry results. Weanalyze the underlying causes and propose a simple yet effective modificationto the DDIM sampling process to address this issue. Additionally, we introducea reference latent texture to strengthen the correlation between frames duringthe denoising process. To the best of our knowledge, Tex4D is the first methodspecifically designed for 4D scene texturing. Extensive experiments demonstrateits superiority in producing multi-view and multi-frame consistent videos basedon untextured mesh sequences.</description><author>Jingzhi Bao, Xueting Li, Ming-Hsuan Yang</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10821v1</guid></item><item><title>When Does Perceptual Alignment Benefit Vision Representations?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10817v1</link><description>Humans judge perceptual similarity according to diverse visual attributes,including scene layout, subject location, and camera pose. Existing visionmodels understand a wide range of semantic abstractions but improperly weighthese attributes and thus make inferences misaligned with human perception.While vision representations have previously benefited from alignment incontexts like image generation, the utility of perceptually alignedrepresentations in more general-purpose settings remains unclear. Here, weinvestigate how aligning vision model representations to human perceptualjudgments impacts their usability across diverse computer vision tasks. Wefinetune state-of-the-art models on human similarity judgments for imagetriplets and evaluate them across standard vision benchmarks. We find thataligning models to perceptual judgments yields representations that improveupon the original backbones across many downstream tasks, including counting,segmentation, depth estimation, instance retrieval, and retrieval-augmentedgeneration. In addition, we find that performance is widely preserved on othertasks, including specialized out-of-distribution domains such as in medicalimaging and 3D environment frames. Our results suggest that injecting aninductive bias about human perceptual knowledge into vision models cancontribute to better representations.</description><author>Shobhita Sundaram, Stephanie Fu, Lukas Muttenthaler, Netanel Y.

Caching all Key and Value (KV)states across all attention heads consumes substantial memory. Existing KVcache pruning methods either damage the long-context capabilities of LLMs oroffer only limited efficiency improvements. In this paper, we identify thatonly a fraction of attention heads, a.k.a, Retrieval Heads, are critical forprocessing long contexts and require full attention across all tokens. Incontrast, all other heads, which primarily focus on recent tokens and attentionsinks--referred to as Streaming Heads--do not require full attention. Based onthis insight, we introduce DuoAttention, a framework that only applies a fullKV cache to retrieval heads while using a light-weight, constant-length KVcache for streaming heads, which reduces both LLM's decoding and pre-fillingmemory and latency without compromising its long-context abilities.DuoAttention uses a lightweight, optimization-based algorithm with syntheticdata to identify retrieval heads accurately. Our method significantly reduceslong-context inference memory by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA modelswhile speeding up decoding by up to 2.18x and 1.50x and acceleratingpre-filling by up to 1.73x and 1.63x for MHA and GQA models, respectively, withminimal accuracy loss compared to full attention. Notably, combined withquantization, DuoAttention enables Llama-3-8B decoding with 3.3 million contextlength on a single A100 GPU.

Due to the lack of fine-grained temporalannotations, existing video benchmarks mostly resemble static image benchmarksand are incompetent at evaluating models for temporal understanding. In thispaper, we introduce TemporalBench, a new benchmark dedicated to evaluatingfine-grained temporal understanding in videos. TemporalBench consists of ~10Kvideo question-answer pairs, derived from ~2K high-quality human annotationsdetailing the temporal dynamics in video clips. As a result, our benchmarkprovides a unique testbed for evaluating various temporal understanding andreasoning abilities such as action frequency, motion magnitude, event order,etc. Moreover, it enables evaluations on various tasks like both video questionanswering and captioning, both short and long video understanding, as well asdifferent models such as multimodal video embedding models and text generationmodels. Results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o achieve only38.5% question answering accuracy on TemporalBench, demonstrating a significantgap (~30%) between humans and AI in temporal understanding. Furthermore, wenotice a critical pitfall for multi-choice QA where LLMs can detect the subtlechanges in negative captions and find a centralized description as a cue forits prediction, where we propose Multiple Binary Accuracy (MBA) to correct suchbias. We hope that TemporalBench can foster research on improving models'temporal reasoning capabilities. Both dataset and evaluation code will be madeavailable.</description><author>Mu Cai, Reuben Tan, Jianrui Zhang, Bocheng Zou, Kai Zhang, Feng Yao, Fangrui Zhu, Jing Gu, Yiwu Zhong, Yuzhang Shang, Yao Dou, Jaden Park, Jianfeng Gao, Yong Jae Lee, Jianwei Yang</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:59:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10818v1</guid></item><item><title>LVD-2M: A Long-take Video Dataset with Temporally Dense Captions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10816v1</link><description>The efficacy of video generation models heavily depends on the quality oftheir training datasets. Most previous video generation models are trained onshort video clips, while recently there has been increasing interest intraining long video generation models directly on longer videos. However, thelack of such high-quality long videos impedes the advancement of long videogeneration. To promote research in long video generation, we desire a newdataset with four key features essential for training long video generationmodels: (1) long videos covering at least 10 seconds, (2) long-take videoswithout cuts, (3) large motion and diverse contents, and (4) temporally densecaptions. To achieve this, we introduce a new pipeline for selectinghigh-quality long-take videos and generating temporally dense captions.Specifically, we define a set of metrics to quantitatively assess video qualityincluding scene cuts, dynamic degrees, and semantic-level quality, enabling usto filter high-quality long-take videos from a large amount of source videos.Subsequently, we develop a hierarchical video captioning pipeline to annotatelong videos with temporally-dense captions. With this pipeline, we curate thefirst long-take video dataset, LVD-2M, comprising 2 million long-take videos,each covering more than 10 seconds and annotated with temporally densecaptions. We further validate the effectiveness of LVD-2M by fine-tuning videogeneration models to generate long videos with dynamic motions. We believe ourwork will significantly contribute to future research in long video generation.</description><author>Tianwei Xiong, Yuqing Wang, Daquan Zhou, Zhijie Lin, Jiashi Feng, Xihui Liu</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:59:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10816v1</guid></item><item><title>Depth Any Video with Scalable Synthetic Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10815v1</link><description>Video depth estimation has long been hindered by the scarcity of consistentand scalable ground truth data, leading to inconsistent and unreliable results.In this paper, we introduce Depth Any Video, a model that tackles the challengethrough two key innovations. First, we develop a scalable synthetic datapipeline, capturing real-time video depth data from diverse syntheticenvironments, yielding 40,000 video clips of 5-second duration, each withprecise depth annotations. Second, we leverage the powerful priors ofgenerative video diffusion models to handle real-world videos effectively,integrating advanced techniques such as rotary position encoding and flowmatching to further enhance flexibility and efficiency. Unlike previous models,which are limited to fixed-length video sequences, our approach introduces anovel mixed-duration training strategy that handles videos of varying lengthsand performs robustly across different frame rates-even on single frames. Atinference, we propose a depth interpolation method that enables our model toinfer high-resolution video depth across sequences of up to 150 frames. Ourmodel outperforms all previous generative depth models in terms of spatialaccuracy and temporal consistency.</description><author>Honghui Yang, Di Huang, Wei Yin, Chunhua Shen, Haifeng Liu, Xiaofei He, Binbin Lin, Wanli Ouyang, Tong He</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:59:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10815v1</guid></item><item><title>Your Mixture-of-Experts LLM Is Secretly an Embedding Model For Free</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10814v1</link><description>While large language models (LLMs) excel on generation tasks, theirdecoder-only architecture often limits their potential as embedding models ifno further representation finetuning is applied. Does this contradict theirclaim of generalists? To answer the question, we take a closer look atMixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. Our study shows that the expert routers in MoELLMs can serve as an off-the-shelf embedding model with promising performanceon a diverse class of embedding-focused tasks, without requiring anyfinetuning. Moreover, our extensive analysis shows that the MoE routing weights(RW) is complementary to the hidden state (HS) of LLMs, a widely-usedembedding. Compared to HS, we find that RW is more robust to the choice ofprompts and focuses on high-level semantics. Motivated by the analysis, wepropose MoEE combining RW and HS, which achieves better performance than usingeither separately. Our exploration of their combination and prompting strategyshed several novel insights, e.g., a weighted sum of RW and HS similaritiesoutperforms the similarity on their concatenation. Our experiments areconducted on 6 embedding tasks with 20 datasets from the Massive Text EmbeddingBenchmark (MTEB). The results demonstrate the significant improvement broughtby MoEE to LLM-based embedding without further finetuning.</description><author>Ziyue Li, Tianyi Zhou</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:59:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10814v1</guid></item><item><title>LongMemEval: Benchmarking Chat Assistants on Long-Term Interactive Memory</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813v1</link><description>Recent large language model (LLM)-driven chat assistant systems haveintegrated memory components to track user-assistant chat histories, enablingmore accurate and personalized responses. However, their long-term memorycapabilities in sustained interactions remain underexplored. This paperintroduces LongMemEval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate fivecore long-term memory abilities of chat assistants: information extraction,multi-session reasoning, temporal reasoning, knowledge updates, and abstention.With 500 meticulously curated questions embedded within freely scalableuser-assistant chat histories, LongMemEval presents a significant challenge toexisting long-term memory systems, with commercial chat assistants andlong-context LLMs showing 30% accuracy drop on memorizing information acrosssustained interactions. We then present a unified framework that breaks downthe long-term memory design into four design choices across the indexing,retrieval, and reading stages. Built upon key experimental insights, we proposeseveral memory designs including session decomposition for optimizing valuegranularity, fact-augmented key expansion for enhancing the index structure,and time-aware query expansion for refining the search scope. Experimentresults show that these optimizations greatly improve both memory recall anddownstream question answering on LongMemEval.

Existing AR models facelimitations due to the poor image reconstruction quality of their discretetokenizers and the prohibitive training costs associated with generating 1024pximages. To address these challenges, we present the hybrid tokenizer, whichdecomposes the continuous latents from the autoencoder into two components:discrete tokens representing the big picture and continuous tokens representingthe residual components that cannot be represented by the discrete tokens. Thediscrete component is modeled by a scalable-resolution discrete AR model, whilethe continuous component is learned with a lightweight residual diffusionmodule with only 37M parameters. Compared with the discrete-only VAR tokenizer,our hybrid approach improves reconstruction FID from 2.11 to 0.30 on MJHQ-30K,leading to a 31% generation FID improvement from 7.85 to 5.38. HART alsooutperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models in both FID and CLIP score, with4.5-7.7x higher throughput and 6.9-13.4x lower MACs.

Recent approaches learndirectly from model weights, but this presents many challenges as weights arehigh-dimensional and include permutation symmetries between neurons. Analternative approach, Probing, represents a model by passing a set of learnedinputs (probes) through the model, and training a predictor on top of thecorresponding outputs. Although probing is typically not used as a stand aloneapproach, our preliminary experiment found that a vanilla probing baselineworked surprisingly well. However, we discover that current probe learningstrategies are ineffective. We therefore propose Deep Linear Probe Generators(ProbeGen), a simple and effective modification to probing approaches. ProbeGenadds a shared generator module with a deep linear architecture, providing aninductive bias towards structured probes thus reducing overfitting. Whilesimple, ProbeGen performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art and isvery efficient, requiring between 30 to 1000 times fewer FLOPs than other topapproaches.</description><author>Jonathan Kahana, Eliahu Horwitz, Imri Shuval, Yedid Hoshen</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:59:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10811v1</guid></item><item><title>Local and Global Decoding in Text Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10810v1</link><description>Text generation, a key component in applications such as dialogue systems,relies on decoding algorithms that sample strings from a language modeldistribution. Traditional methods, such as top-$k$ and top-$\pi$, apply localnormalisation to the model's output distribution, which can distort it. In thispaper, we investigate the effect of this distortion by introducingglobally-normalised versions of these decoding methods. Additionally, wepropose an independent Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to approximate samplingfrom globally-normalised distributions without explicitly computing them. Ourempirical analysis compares the performance of local and global normalisationacross two decoding algorithms (top-$k$ and top-$\pi$) with varioushyperparameters, using Pythia language models. Results show that, in mostconfigurations, global decoding performs worse than the local decoding versionof the same algorithms -- despite preserving the distribution's integrity. Ourresults suggest that distortion is an important feature of local decodingalgorithms.</description><author>Daniel Gareev, Thomas Hofmann, Ezhilmathi Krishnasamy, Tiago Pimentel</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:59:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10810v1</guid></item><item><title>Hard-Constrained Neural Networks with Universal Approximation Guarantees</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10807v1</link><description>Incorporating prior knowledge or specifications of input-output relationshipsinto machine learning models has gained significant attention, as it enhancesgeneralization from limited data and leads to conforming outputs. However, mostexisting approaches use soft constraints by penalizing violations throughregularization, which offers no guarantee of constraint satisfaction -- anessential requirement in safety-critical applications. On the other hand,imposing hard constraints on neural networks may hinder their representationalpower, adversely affecting performance. To address this, we propose HardNet, apractical framework for constructing neural networks that inherently satisfyhard constraints without sacrificing model capacity. Specifically, we encodeaffine and convex hard constraints, dependent on both inputs and outputs, byappending a differentiable projection layer to the network's output. Thisarchitecture allows unconstrained optimization of the network parameters usingstandard algorithms while ensuring constraint satisfaction by construction.Furthermore, we show that HardNet retains the universal approximationcapabilities of neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility andeffectiveness of HardNet across various applications: fitting functions underconstraints, learning optimization solvers, optimizing control policies insafety-critical systems, and learning safe decision logic for aircraft systems.</description><author>Youngjae Min, Anoopkumar Sonar, Navid Azizan</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:59:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10807v1</guid></item><item><title>TL-PCA: Transfer Learning of Principal Component Analysis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10805v1</link><description>Principal component analysis (PCA) can be significantly limited when there istoo few examples of the target data of interest. We propose a transfer learningapproach to PCA (TL-PCA) where knowledge from a related source task is used inaddition to the scarce data of a target task. Our TL-PCA has two versions, onethat uses a pretrained PCA solution of the source task, and another that usesthe source data. Our proposed approach extends the PCA optimization objectivewith a penalty on the proximity of the target subspace and the source subspaceas given by the pretrained source model or the source data. This optimizationis solved by eigendecomposition for which the number of data-dependenteigenvectors (i.e., principal directions of TL-PCA) is not limited to thenumber of target data examples, which is a root cause that limits the standardPCA performance. Accordingly, our results for image datasets show that therepresentation of test data is improved by TL-PCA for dimensionality reductionwhere the learned subspace dimension is lower or higher than the number oftarget data examples.</description><author>Sharon Hendy, Yehuda Dar</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:59:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10805v1</guid></item><item><title>TrajDiffuse: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Environment-Aware Trajectory Prediction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10804v1</link><description>Accurate prediction of human or vehicle trajectories with good diversity thatcaptures their stochastic nature is an essential task for many applications.However, many trajectory prediction models produce unreasonable trajectorysamples that focus on improving diversity or accuracy while neglecting otherkey requirements, such as collision avoidance with the surrounding environment.In this work, we propose TrajDiffuse, a planning-based trajectory predictionmethod using a novel guided conditional diffusion model. We form the trajectoryprediction problem as a denoising impaint task and design a map-based guidanceterm for the diffusion process. TrajDiffuse is able to generate trajectorypredictions that match or exceed the accuracy and diversity of the SOTA, whileadhering almost perfectly to environmental constraints.

However, autonomous manipulation by humanoidrobots has largely been restricted to one specific scene, primarily due to thedifficulty of acquiring generalizable skills. Recent advances in 3D visuomotorpolicies, such as the 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3), have shown promise inextending these capabilities to wilder environments. However, 3D visuomotorpolicies often rely on camera calibration and point-cloud segmentation, whichpresent challenges for deployment on mobile robots like humanoids. In thiswork, we introduce the Improved 3D Diffusion Policy (iDP3), a novel 3Dvisuomotor policy that eliminates these constraints by leveraging egocentric 3Dvisual representations.

Differentiable simulation promises fastconvergence and stable training by computing low-variance first-order gradientsusing robot dynamics. However, its usage for legged robots is still limited tosimulation. The main challenge lies in the complex optimization landscape ofrobotic tasks due to discontinuous dynamics. This work proposes a newdifferentiable simulation framework to overcome these challenges. Our approachcombines a high-fidelity, non-differentiable simulator for forward dynamicswith a simplified surrogate model for gradient backpropagation. This approachmaintains simulation accuracy by aligning the robot states from the surrogatemodel with those of the precise, non-differentiable simulator. Our frameworkenables learning quadruped walking in simulation in minutes withoutparallelization. When augmented with GPU parallelization, our approach allowsthe quadruped robot to master diverse locomotion skills on challenging terrainsin minutes. We demonstrate that differentiable simulation outperforms areinforcement learning algorithm (PPO) by achieving significantly better sampleefficiency while maintaining its effectiveness in handling large-scaleenvironments.

Towards that goal, it is important to understand the 3D reasoningcapabilities of current models as well as identify the gaps between thesemodels and humans. Therefore, we construct a new 3D visual understandingbenchmark that covers fundamental 3D vision tasks in the Visual QuestionAnswering (VQA) format. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models(VLMs), specialized models, and human subjects on it. Our results show thatVLMs generally perform poorly, while the specialized models are accurate butnot robust, failing under geometric perturbations. In contrast, human visioncontinues to be the most reliable 3D visual system. We further demonstrate thatneural networks align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms compared toclassical computer vision methods, and Transformer-based networks such as ViTalign more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms than CNNs.

To address this issue, wepropose a novel Multi-Modal Auto-Regressive (MMAR) probabilistic modelingframework. Unlike discretization line of method, MMAR takes incontinuous-valued image tokens to avoid information loss. Differing fromdiffusion-based approaches, we disentangle the diffusion process fromauto-regressive backbone model by employing a light-weight diffusion head ontop each auto-regressed image patch embedding. In this way, when the modeltransits from image generation to understanding through text generation, thebackbone model's hidden representation of the image is not limited to the lastdenoising step. To successfully train our method, we also propose atheoretically proven technique that addresses the numerical stability issue anda training strategy that balances the generation and understanding task goals.Through extensive evaluations on 18 image understanding benchmarks, MMARdemonstrates much more superior performance than other joint multi-modalmodels, matching the method that employs pretrained CLIP vision encoder,meanwhile being able to generate high quality images at the same time. We alsoshowed that our method is scalable with larger data and model size.</description><author>Jian Yang, Dacheng Yin, Yizhou Zhou, Fengyun Rao, Wei Zhai, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:57:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10798v1</guid></item><item><title>Context-Parametric Inversion: Why Instruction Finetuning May Not Actually Improve Context Reliance</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10796v1</link><description>Large language models are instruction-finetuned to enhance their ability tofollow user instructions and process the input context. However, evenstate-of-the-art models often struggle to follow the instruction, especiallywhen the input context is not aligned with the model's parametric knowledge.This manifests as various failures, such as hallucinations where the responsesare outdated, biased or contain unverified facts. In this work, we try tounderstand the underlying reason for this poor context reliance, especiallyafter instruction tuning. We observe an intriguing phenomenon: duringinstruction tuning, the context reliance initially increases as expected, butthen gradually decreases as instruction finetuning progresses. We call thisphenomenon context-parametric inversion and observe it across multiple generalpurpose instruction tuning datasets like TULU, Alpaca and Ultrachat, as well asmodel families such as Llama, Mistral and Pythia. In a simple theoreticalsetup, we isolate why context-parametric inversion occurs along the gradientdescent trajectory of instruction finetuning. We tie this phenomena to examplesin the instruction finetuning data mixture where the input context providesinformation that is already present in the model's parametric knowledge. Ouranalysis suggests natural mitigation strategies that provide some limitedgains, while also validating our theoretical insights. We hope that our workserves as a starting point in addressing this failure mode in a staple part ofLLM training.</description><author>Sachin Goyal, Christina Baek, J.

This paperaddresses two key tasks: (i) inversion and (ii) editing of a real image usingstochastic equivalents of rectified flow models (such as Flux). AlthoughDiffusion Models (DMs) have recently dominated the field of generative modelingfor images, their inversion presents faithfulness and editability challengesdue to nonlinearities in drift and diffusion. Existing state-of-the-art DMinversion approaches rely on training of additional parameters or test-timeoptimization of latent variables; both are expensive in practice. RectifiedFlows (RFs) offer a promising alternative to diffusion models, yet theirinversion has been underexplored. We propose RF inversion using dynamic optimalcontrol derived via a linear quadratic regulator. We prove that the resultingvector field is equivalent to a rectified stochastic differential equation.Additionally, we extend our framework to design a stochastic sampler for Flux.Our inversion method allows for state-of-the-art performance in zero-shotinversion and editing, outperforming prior works in stroke-to-image synthesisand semantic image editing, with large-scale human evaluations confirming userpreference.</description><author>Litu Rout, Yujia Chen, Nataniel Ruiz, Constantine Caramanis, Sanjay Shakkottai, Wen-Sheng Chu</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:56:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10792v1</guid></item><item><title>Condition-Aware Multimodal Fusion for Robust Semantic Perception of Driving Scenes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10791v1</link><description>Leveraging multiple sensors is crucial for robust semantic perception inautonomous driving, as each sensor type has complementary strengths andweaknesses. However, existing sensor fusion methods often treat sensorsuniformly across all conditions, leading to suboptimal performance. Bycontrast, we propose a novel, condition-aware multimodal fusion approach forrobust semantic perception of driving scenes. Our method, CAFuser uses an RGBcamera input to classify environmental conditions and generate a ConditionToken that guides the fusion of multiple sensor modalities. We further newlyintroduce modality-specific feature adapters to align diverse sensor inputsinto a shared latent space, enabling efficient integration with a single andshared pre-trained backbone. By dynamically adapting sensor fusion based on theactual condition, our model significantly improves robustness and accuracy,especially in adverse-condition scenarios.

In response, we introduceSitcom-Crafter, a comprehensive and extendable system for human motiongeneration in 3D space, which can be guided by extensive plot contexts toenhance workflow efficiency for anime and game designers. The system iscomprised of eight modules, three of which are dedicated to motion generation,while the remaining five are augmentation modules that ensure consistent fusionof motion sequences and system functionality. Central to the generation modulesis our novel 3D scene-aware human-human interaction module, which addressescollision issues by synthesizing implicit 3D Signed Distance Function (SDF)points around motion spaces, thereby minimizing human-scene collisions withoutadditional data collection costs. Complementing this, our locomotion andhuman-scene interaction modules leverage existing methods to enrich thesystem's motion generation capabilities. Augmentation modules encompass plotcomprehension for command generation, motion synchronization for seamlessintegration of different motion types, hand pose retrieval to enhance motionrealism, motion collision revision to prevent human collisions, and 3Dretargeting to ensure visual fidelity.

Despite its significance, a consensus on the correct measurementof predictive uncertainty remains elusive. In this work, we return to firstprinciples to develop a fundamental framework of information-theoreticpredictive uncertainty measures. Our proposed framework categorizes predictiveuncertainty measures according to two factors: (I) The predicting model (II)The approximation of the true predictive distribution. Examining all possiblecombinations of these two factors, we derive a set of predictive uncertaintymeasures that includes both known and newly introduced ones. We empiricallyevaluate these measures in typical uncertainty estimation settings, such asmisclassification detection, selective prediction, and out-of-distributiondetection. The results show that no single measure is universal, but theeffectiveness depends on the specific setting. Thus, our work provides clarityabout the suitability of predictive uncertainty measures by clarifying theirimplicit assumptions and relationships.</description><author>Kajetan Schweighofer, Lukas Aichberger, Mykyta Ielanskyi, Sepp Hochreiter</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:52:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10786v1</guid></item><item><title>LiveXiv -- A Multi-Modal Live Benchmark Based on Arxiv Papers Content</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10783v1</link><description>The large-scale training of multi-modal models on data scraped from the webhas shown outstanding utility in infusing these models with the required worldknowledge to perform effectively on multiple downstream tasks.

Tosafeguard against test data contamination and to truly test the abilities ofthese foundation models we propose LiveXiv: A scalable evolving live benchmarkbased on scientific ArXiv papers. LiveXiv accesses domain-specific manuscriptsat any given timestamp and proposes to automatically generate visualquestion-answer pairs (VQA).

A common limitationfaced in these research areas is the data scarcity problem: insufficientlabeled human-scene object pairs on the input images, and limited interactioncomplexity and granularity between them. Recent HOI and HSI methods haveaddressed this issue by generating dynamic interactions with rigid objects. Butmore complex dynamic interactions such as a human rider pedaling an articulatedbicycle have been unexplored. To address this limitation, and to enableresearch on complex dynamic human-articulated object interactions, in thispaper we propose a method to generate simulated 3D dynamic cyclist assets andinteractions. We designed a methodology for creating a new part-basedmulti-view articulated synthetic 3D bicycle dataset that we call 3DArticBikesthat can be used to train NeRF and 3DGS-based 3D reconstruction methods. Wethen propose a 3DGS-based parametric bicycle composition model to assemble8-DoF pose-controllable 3D bicycles. Finally, using dynamic information fromcyclist videos, we build a complete synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist (riderpedaling a bicycle) by re-posing a selectable synthetic 3D person whileautomatically placing the rider onto one of our new articulated 3D bicyclesusing a proposed 3D Keypoint optimization-based Inverse Kinematics poserefinement.

Thisphenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/longcontext generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, modelquantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding ofattention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate thatattention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in smallmodels. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LMpre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution,loss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence itsemergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effectiveoptimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highlycorrelated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, wefind that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attentionscores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the valuecomputation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stemsfrom tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmaxnormalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attentionwith other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention withoutnormalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters.

However, despite achieving acceptablecontrol precision, these models suffer from generation speed and fidelitylimitations. To address these challenges, we propose ControlMM, a novelapproach incorporating spatial control signals into the generative maskedmotion model. ControlMM achieves real-time, high-fidelity, and high-precisioncontrollable motion generation simultaneously. Our approach introduces two keyinnovations. First, we propose masked consistency modeling, which ensureshigh-fidelity motion generation via random masking and reconstruction, whileminimizing the inconsistency between the input control signals and theextracted control signals from the generated motion. To further enhance controlprecision, we introduce inference-time logit editing, which manipulates thepredicted conditional motion distribution so that the generated motion, sampledfrom the adjusted distribution, closely adheres to the input control signals.During inference, ControlMM enables parallel and iterative decoding of multiplemotion tokens, allowing for high-speed motion generation. Extensive experimentsshow that, compared to the state of the art, ControlMM delivers superiorresults in motion quality, with better FID scores (0.061 vs 0.271), and highercontrol precision (average error 0.0091 vs 0.0108). ControlMM generates motions20 times faster than diffusion-based methods. Additionally, ControlMM unlocksdiverse applications such as any joint any frame control, body part timelinecontrol, and obstacle avoidance.

Among recent works, UniMatch improves its precedents tremendouslyby amplifying the practice of weak-to-strong consistency regularization.Subsequent works typically follow similar pipelines and propose variousdelicate designs. Despite the achieved progress, strangely, even in thisflourishing era of numerous powerful vision models, almost all SSS works arestill sticking to 1) using outdated ResNet encoders with small-scaleImageNet-1K pre-training, and 2) evaluation on simple Pascal and Cityscapesdatasets. In this work, we argue that, it is necessary to switch the baselineof SSS from ResNet-based encoders to more capable ViT-based encoders (e.g.,DINOv2) that are pre-trained on massive data. A simple update on the encoder(even using 2x fewer parameters) can bring more significant improvement thancareful method designs. Built on this competitive baseline, we present ourupgraded and simplified UniMatch V2, inheriting the core spirit ofweak-to-strong consistency from V1, but requiring less training cost andproviding consistently better results. Additionally, witnessing the graduallysaturated performance on Pascal and Cityscapes, we appeal that we should focuson more challenging benchmarks with complex taxonomy, such as ADE20K and COCOdatasets.

However, the 3D consistency and camera controllability of generatedframes have remained unsolved. Recent studies have attempted to incorporatecamera control into the generation process, but their results are often limitedto simple trajectories or lack the ability to generate consistent videos frommultiple distinct camera paths for the same scene. To address theselimitations, we introduce Cavia, a novel framework for camera-controllable,multi-view video generation, capable of converting an input image into multiplespatiotemporally consistent videos. Our framework extends the spatial andtemporal attention modules into view-integrated attention modules, improvingboth viewpoint and temporal consistency. This flexible design allows for jointtraining with diverse curated data sources, including scene-level staticvideos, object-level synthetic multi-view dynamic videos, and real-worldmonocular dynamic videos. To our best knowledge, Cavia is the first of its kindthat allows the user to precisely specify camera motion while obtaining objectmotion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Cavia surpasses state-of-the-artmethods in terms of geometric consistency and perceptual quality.

We begin by showing evidence that a prominent open-source LLM hasa "user model": examining the internal state of the system, we can extract datarelated to a user's age, gender, educational level, and socioeconomic status.Next, we describe the design of a dashboard that accompanies the chatbotinterface, displaying this user model in real time. The dashboard can also beused to control the user model and the system's behavior. Finally, we discuss astudy in which users conversed with the instrumented system.

In this work, we focus on athreat model where the adversary has access only to the final model, with novisibility into intermediate updates. In the literature, this hidden statethreat model exhibits a significant gap between the lower bound from empiricalprivacy auditing and the theoretical upper bound provided by privacyaccounting. To challenge this gap, we propose to audit this threat model withadversaries that \emph{craft a gradient sequence} designed to maximize theprivacy loss of the final model without relying on intermediate updates. Ourexperiments show that this approach consistently outperforms previous attemptsat auditing the hidden state model. Furthermore, our results advance theunderstanding of achievable privacy guarantees within this threat model.Specifically, when the crafted gradient is inserted at every optimization step,we show that concealing the intermediate model updates in DP-SGD does notamplify privacy. The situation is more complex when the crafted gradient is notinserted at every step: our auditing lower bound matches the privacy upperbound only for an adversarially-chosen loss landscape and a sufficiently largebatch size. This suggests that existing privacy upper bounds can be improved incertain regimes.</description><author>Tudor Cebere, Aurélien Bellet, Nicolas Papernot</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:45:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14457v2</guid></item><item><title>Enhancing Indonesian Automatic Speech Recognition: Evaluating Multilingual Models with Diverse Speech Variabilities</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08828v2</link><description>An ideal speech recognition model has the capability to transcribe speechaccurately under various characteristics of speech signals, such as speakingstyle (read and spontaneous), speech context (formal and informal), andbackground noise conditions (clean and moderate).

However,constructing these workflows requires significant human effort, limitingscalability and generalizability. Recent research has sought to automate thegeneration and optimization of these workflows, but existing methods still relyon initial manual setup and fall short of achieving fully automated andeffective workflow generation. To address this challenge, we reformulateworkflow optimization as a search problem over code-represented workflows,where LLM-invoking nodes are connected by edges.

These attacks canpotentially cause high latency and make LLM services inaccessible to otherusers or tasks. However, when there are speech-to-text interfaces (e.g., voicecommands to a robot), executing such DoS attacks becomes challenging, as it isdifficult to introduce spelling errors or non-semantic prompts through speech.A simple DoS attack in these scenarios would be to instruct the model to "Keeprepeating Hello", but we observe that relying solely on natural instructionslimits output length, which is bounded by the maximum length of the LLM'ssupervised finetuning (SFT) data. To overcome this limitation, we proposepoisoning-based DoS (P-DoS) attacks for LLMs, demonstrating that injecting asingle poisoned sample designed for DoS purposes can break the output lengthlimit. For example, a poisoned sample can successfully attack GPT-4o and GPT-4omini (via OpenAI's finetuning API) using less than $1, causing repeated outputsup to the maximum inference length (16K tokens, compared to 0.5K beforepoisoning). Additionally, we perform comprehensive ablation studies onopen-source LLMs and extend our method to LLM agents, where attackers cancontrol both the finetuning dataset and algorithm. Our findings underscore theurgent need for defenses against P-DoS attacks to secure LLMs. Our code isavailable at https://github.com/sail-sg/P-DoS.</description><author>Kuofeng Gao, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Yong Yang, Shu-Tao Xia, Min Lin</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:39:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10760v1</guid></item><item><title>SplitLLM: Collaborative Inference of LLMs for Model Placement and Throughput Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10759v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have been a disruptive innovation in recentyears, and they play a crucial role in our daily lives due to their ability tounderstand and generate human-like text. Their capabilities include naturallanguage understanding, information retrieval and search, translation,chatbots, virtual assistance, and many more. However, it is well known thatLLMs are massive in terms of the number of parameters. Additionally, theself-attention mechanism in the underlying architecture of LLMs, Transformers,has quadratic complexity in terms of both computation and memory with respectto the input sequence length. For these reasons, LLM inference isresource-intensive, and thus, the throughput of LLM inference is limited,especially for the longer sequences. In this report, we design a collaborativeinference architecture between a server and its clients to alleviate thethroughput limit. In this design, we consider the available resources on bothsides, i.e., the computation and communication costs. We develop a dynamicprogramming-based algorithm to optimally allocate computation between theserver and the client device to increase the server throughput, while notviolating the service level agreement (SLA). We show in the experiments that weare able to efficiently distribute the workload allowing for roughly 1/3reduction in the server workload, while achieving 19 percent improvement over agreedy method. As a result, we are able to demonstrate that, in an environmentwith different types of LLM inference requests, the throughput of the server isimproved.</description><author>Akrit Mudvari, Yuang Jiang, Leandros Tassiulas</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:38:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10759v1</guid></item><item><title>Arrhythmia Classification Using Graph Neural Networks Based on Correlation Matrix</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10758v1</link><description>With the advancements in graph neural network, there has been increasinginterest in applying this network to ECG signal analysis.

Prior approaches relyon increasing temperature to increase diversity. However, contrary to popularbelief, we show not only does this approach produce lower quality individualgenerations as temperature increases, but it depends on model's next-tokenprobabilities being similar to the true distribution of answers.

However, existing control methods still face twolimitations: Firstly, control conditions (such as depth maps, 3D Mesh) aredifficult for ordinary users to obtain directly. Secondly, it's challenging todrive multiple objects through complex motions with multiple trajectoriessimultaneously. In this paper, we introduce DragEntity, a video generationmodel that utilizes entity representation for controlling the motion ofmultiple objects. Compared to previous methods, DragEntity offers two mainadvantages: 1) Our method is more user-friendly for interaction because itallows users to drag entities within the image rather than individual pixels.2) We use entity representation to represent any object in the image, andmultiple objects can maintain relative spatial relationships. Therefore, weallow multiple trajectories to control multiple objects in the image withdifferent levels of complexity simultaneously. Our experiments validate theeffectiveness of DragEntity, demonstrating its excellent performance infine-grained control in video generation.</description><author>Zhang Wan, Sheng Tang, Jiawei Wei, Ruize Zhang, Juan Cao</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:24:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10751v1</guid></item><item><title>FlexGen: Flexible Multi-View Generation from Text and Image Inputs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10745v1</link><description>In this work, we introduce FlexGen, a flexible framework designed to generatecontrollable and consistent multi-view images, conditioned on a single-viewimage, or a text prompt, or both.

However, theincreased data complexity inherent in adversarial training, and the myriad ofways that OOD samples can arise during testing, often prevent these approachesfrom establishing robust decision boundaries. To address these limitations, wepropose AROS, a novel approach leveraging neural ordinary differentialequations (NODEs) with Lyapunov stability theorem in order to obtain robustembeddings for OOD detection. By incorporating a tailored loss function, weapply Lyapunov stability theory to ensure that both in-distribution (ID) andOOD data converge to stable equilibrium points within the dynamical system.This approach encourages any perturbed input to return to its stableequilibrium, thereby enhancing the model's robustness against adversarialperturbations. To not use additional data, we generate fake OOD embeddings bysampling from low-likelihood regions of the ID data feature space,approximating the boundaries where OOD data are likely to reside. To thenfurther enhance robustness, we propose the use of an orthogonal binary layerfollowing the stable feature space, which maximizes the separation between theequilibrium points of ID and OOD samples. We validate our method throughextensive experiments across several benchmarks, demonstrating superiorperformance, particularly under adversarial attacks. Notably, our approachimproves robust detection performance from 37.8% to 80.1% on CIFAR-10 vs.CIFAR-100 and from 29.0% to 67.0% on CIFAR-100 vs. CIFAR-10.</description><author>Hossein Mirzaei, Mackenzie W.

With the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) acrossvarious natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there has been growinginterest in integrating LLMs for graph learning. However, applying LLMs tograph-related tasks poses significant challenges, as these models are notinherently designed to capture the complex structural information present ingraphs. Existing approaches address this challenge through two strategies: thechain of tasks approach, which uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode thegraph structure so that LLMs are relieved from understanding spatial positions;and Graph-to-Text Conversion, which translates graph structures into semantictext representations that LLMs can process. Despite their progress, thesemethods often struggle to fully preserve the topological information of graphsor require extensive computational resources, limiting their practicalapplicability. In this work, we introduce Node Tokenizer for Large Language Models (NT-LLM),a novel framework that efficiently encodes graph structures by selecting keynodes as anchors and representing each node based on its relative distance tothese anchors. This position-anchored encoding effectively captures the graphtopology, enabling enhanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs over graph data.Additionally, we implement a task-specific tuning procedure to further improvestructural understanding within LLMs. Through extensive empirical evaluations,NT-LLM demonstrates significant performance improvements across a variety ofgraph-related tasks.</description><author>Yanbiao Ji, Chang Liu, Xin Chen, Yue Ding, Dan Luo, Mei Li, Wenqing Lin, Hongtao Lu</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:21:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10743v1</guid></item><item><title>SensorBench: Benchmarking LLMs in Coding-Based Sensor Processing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10741v1</link><description>Effective processing, interpretation, and management of sensor data haveemerged as a critical component of cyber-physical systems.

A natural question is whichsurrogates can be used to ensure learning in scenarios where the input pointsare adversarially perturbed and the classifier can abstain from prediction?This paper aims to characterize and design surrogates calibrated in"Adversarial Robust Reject Option" setting. First, we propose an adversarialrobust reject option loss $\ell_{d}^{\gamma}$ and analyze it for the hypothesisset of linear classifiers ($\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{lin}}$). Next, we provide acomplete characterization result for any surrogate to be$(\ell_{d}^{\gamma},\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{lin}})$- calibrated. To demonstratethe difficulty in designing surrogates to $\ell_{d}^{\gamma}$, we show negativecalibration results for convex surrogates and quasi-concave conditional riskcases (these gave positive calibration in adversarial setting without rejectoption).

However, LLMsoften encounter difficulties in certain aspects of mathematical reasoning,leading to flawed reasoning and erroneous results. To mitigate these issues, weintroduce a novel mechanism, the Chain of Self-Correction (CoSC), specificallydesigned to embed self-correction as an inherent ability in LLMs, enabling themto validate and rectify their own results. The CoSC mechanism operates througha sequence of self-correction stages. In each stage, the LLMs generate aprogram to address a given problem, execute this program using program-basedtools to obtain an output, subsequently verify this output. Based on theverification, the LLMs either proceed to the next correction stage or finalizethe answer. This iterative self-correction process allows the LLMs to refinetheir reasoning steps and improve the accuracy of their mathematical reasoning.To enable the CoSC mechanism at a low cost, we employ a two-phase finetuningapproach. In the first phase, the LLMs are trained with a relatively smallvolume of seeding data generated from GPT-4, establishing an initial CoSCcapability. In the second phase, the CoSC capability is further enhanced bytraining with a larger volume of self-generated data using the trained model inthe first phase, without relying on the paid GPT-4. Our comprehensiveexperiments demonstrate that CoSC significantly improves performance ontraditional mathematical datasets among existing open-source LLMs. Notably, ourCoSC-Code-34B model achieved a 53.5% score on MATH, the most challengingmathematical reasoning dataset in the public domain, surpassing the performanceof well-established models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and even multi-modal LLMslike GPT-4V, Gemini-1.0 Pro, and Gemini-1.0 Ultra.</description><author>Kuofeng Gao, Huanqia Cai, Qingyao Shuai, Dihong Gong, Zhifeng Li</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:16:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10735v1</guid></item><item><title>Deep Compression Autoencoder for Efficient High-Resolution Diffusion Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10733v1</link><description>We present Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE), a new family of autoencodermodels for accelerating high-resolution diffusion models. Existing autoencodermodels have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compressionratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy forhigh spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge byintroducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design ourmodels to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features toalleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders;(2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phasestraining strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of highspatial-compression autoencoders.

In this work, we aim at capturing the A$\beta$ positivity status inan unbalanced cohort enclosing subjects at different disease stages, exploitingthe underlying structural and connectivity disease-induced modulations asrevealed by structural, functional, and diffusion MRI.

This process treats LLMs as ''passivecritics,'' strictly following human-defined criteria for evaluation. However,as new NLG tasks emerge, the criteria for assessing text quality can varygreatly. Consequently, these rigid evaluation methods struggle to adapt todiverse NLG tasks without extensive prompt engineering customized for eachspecific task. To address this limitation, we introduce Active-Critic, a novelLLM-based NLG evaluation protocol that enables LLMs to function as ''activecritics.'' Specifically, our protocol comprises two key stages. In the firststage, the LLM is instructed to infer the target NLG task and establishrelevant evaluation criteria from the data. Building on this self-inferredinformation, the second stage dynamically optimizes the prompt to guide the LLMtoward more human-aligned scoring decisions, while also generating detailedexplanations to justify its evaluations. Experiments across four NLG evaluationtasks show that our approach achieves stronger alignment with human judgmentsthan state-of-the-art evaluation methods. Our comprehensive analysis furtherhighlights the effectiveness and explainability of Active-Critic with only asmall amount of labeled data. We will share our code and data on GitHub.</description><author>Shuying Xu, Junjie Hu, Ming Jiang</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 17:04:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10724v1</guid></item><item><title>Reducing the Barriers to Entry for Foundation Model Training</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08811v2</link><description>The world has recently witnessed an unprecedented acceleration in demands forMachine Learning and Artificial Intelligence applications.

In this paper, we introduce SeedLM, a novel post-trainingcompression method that uses seeds of pseudo-random generators to encode andcompress model weights. Specifically, for each block of weights, we find a seedthat is fed into a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) during inference toefficiently generate a random matrix. This matrix is then linearly combinedwith compressed coefficients to reconstruct the weight block. SeedLM reducesmemory access and leverages idle compute cycles during inference, effectivelyspeeding up memory-bound tasks by trading compute for fewer memory accesses.Unlike state-of-the-art compression methods that rely on calibration data, ourapproach is data-free and generalizes well across diverse tasks. Ourexperiments with Llama 3 70B, which is particularly challenging to compress,show that SeedLM achieves significantly better zero-shot accuracy retention at4- and 3-bit than state-of-the-art techniques, while maintaining performancecomparable to FP16 baselines. Additionally, FPGA-based tests demonstrate that4-bit SeedLM, as model size increases to 70B, approaches a 4x speed-up over anFP16 Llama 2/3 baseline.</description><author>Rasoul Shafipour, David Harrison, Maxwell Horton, Jeffrey Marker, Houman Bedayat, Sachin Mehta, Mohammad Rastegari, Mahyar Najibi, Saman Naderiparizi</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 16:57:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10714v1</guid></item><item><title>Converging Paradigms: The Synergy of Symbolic and Connectionist AI in LLM-Empowered Autonomous Agents</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08516v5</link><description>This article explores the convergence of connectionist and symbolicartificial intelligence (AI), from historical debates to contemporaryadvancements.

In this work,we revisit the task of few-shot object detection (FSOD) in the context ofrecent foundational VLMs. First, we point out that zero-shot predictions fromVLMs such as GroundingDINO significantly outperform state-of-the-art few-shotdetectors (48 vs. 33 AP) on COCO. Despite their strong zero-shot performance,such foundation models may still be sub-optimal. For example, trucks on the webmay be defined differently from trucks for a target application such asautonomous vehicle perception. We argue that the task of few-shot recognitioncan be reformulated as aligning foundation models to target concepts using afew examples. Interestingly, such examples can be multi-modal, using both textand visual cues, mimicking instructions that are often given to humanannotators when defining a target concept of interest. Concretely, we proposeFoundational FSOD, a new benchmark protocol that evaluates detectorspre-trained on any external data and fine-tuned on multi-modal (text andvisual) K-shot examples per target class.

However,most existing works neglect the explicit control of human bodies. In thispaper, we propose to drive not only the faces but also the torso and gesturemovements of a speaking figure. Inspired by recent advances in diffusionmodels, we propose the Motion-Enhanced Textural-Aware ModeLing for SpeaKingAvatar Reenactment (TALK-Act) framework, which enables high-fidelity avatarreenactment from only short footage of monocular video. Our key idea is toenhance the textural awareness with explicit motion guidance in diffusionmodeling. Specifically, we carefully construct 2D and 3D structural informationas intermediate guidance. While recent diffusion models adopt a side networkfor control information injection, they fail to synthesize temporally stableresults even with person-specific fine-tuning. We propose a Motion-EnhancedTextural Alignment module to enhance the bond between driving and targetsignals. Moreover, we build a Memory-based Hand-Recovering module to help withthe difficulties in hand-shape preserving. After pre-training, our model canachieve high-fidelity 2D avatar reenactment with only 30 seconds ofperson-specific data.

As established scaling laws indicate,LLMs' future performance improvement depends on the amount of computing anddata sources they can leverage for pre-training. Federated learning (FL) hasthe potential to unleash the majority of the planet's data and computationalresources, which are underutilized by the data-center-focused trainingmethodology of current LLM practice. Our work presents a robust, flexible,reproducible FL approach that enables large-scale collaboration acrossinstitutions to train LLMs. We propose a scalable deployment system calledPhoton to enable the investigation and development of this new trainingparadigm for LLM pre-training. We show that Photon can be used by organizationsinterested in collaborating with their private data sources and computationalresources for pre-training LLMs with billions of parameters. This paradigmwould mobilize more computational and data resources while matching orpotentially exceeding centralized performance. We further show theeffectiveness of the federated training scales with model size and present ourapproach for training billion-scale federated LLMs using limited resources.Thus far, we have used Photon to train LLM models to the size of 7B parametersand anticipate larger models being completed in the near future.

This one-to-many mappingissue can cause contradictory supervision signals to the network because theloss function may produce different values for identical input-output pairs ofthe network. In many cases, this issue could adversely affect the networkoptimization process.

Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) allows toredirected these signals into spare muscles to recover the neural informationthrough electromyography (EMG). However, a significant challenge arises inseparating distinct neural commands redirected from the transferred nerves tothe muscles. Disentangling overlapping signals from EMG recordings remainscomplex, as they can contain mixed neural information that complicates limbfunction interpretation. To address this challenge, Regenerative PeripheralNerve Interfaces (RPNIs) surgically partition the nerve into individualfascicles that reinnervate specific muscle grafts, isolating distinct neuralsources for more precise control and interpretation of EMG signals. Weintroduce a novel biointerface that combines TMR surgery of polyvalent nerveswith a high-density micro-electrode array implanted at a single site within areinnervated muscle. Instead of surgically identifying distinct nervefascicles, our approach separates all neural signals that are re-directed intoa single muscle, using the high spatio-temporal selectivity of themicro-electrode array and mathematical source separation methods. We recordedEMG signals from four reinnervated muscles while volunteers performed phantomlimb tasks. The decomposition of these signals into motor unit activityrevealed distinct clusters of motor neurons associated with diverse functionaltasks. Notably, our method enabled the extraction of multiple neural commandswithin a single reinnervated muscle, eliminating the need for surgical nervedivision. This approach not only has the potential of enhancing prosthesiscontrol but also uncovers mechanisms of motor neuron synergies following TMR,providing valuable insights into how the central nervous system encodesmovement after reinnervation.</description><author>Laura Ferrante, Anna Boesendorfer, Deren Yusuf Barsakcioglu, Benedikt Baumgartner, Yazan Al-Ajam, Alex Woollard, Norbert Venantius Kang, Oskar Aszmann, Dario Farina</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 16:32:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10694v1</guid></item><item><title>Sign Stitching: A Novel Approach to Sign Language Production</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07663v2</link><description>Sign Language Production (SLP) is a challenging task, given the limitedresources available and the inherent diversity within sign data.

Therefore, we present a 7-step approach to effectively stitch thesigns together. First, by normalising each sign into a canonical pose, croppingand stitching we create a continuous sequence. Then by applying filtering inthe frequency domain and resampling each sign we create cohesive naturalsequences, that mimic the prosody found in the original data.

However, each SAM update requires\emph{sequentially} computing two gradients, effectively doubling theper-iteration cost compared to base optimizers like SGD. We propose a simplemodification of SAM, termed SAMPa, which allows us to fully parallelize the twogradient computations. SAMPa achieves a twofold speedup of SAM under theassumption that communication costs between devices are negligible. Empiricalresults show that SAMPa ranks among the most efficient variants of SAM in termsof computational time. Additionally, our method consistently outperforms SAMacross both vision and language tasks. Notably, SAMPa theoretically maintainsconvergence guarantees even for \emph{fixed} perturbation sizes, which isestablished through a novel Lyapunov function. We in fact arrive at SAMPa bytreating this convergence guarantee as a hard requirement -- an approach webelieve is promising for developing SAM-based methods in general.

At each instance, this oracleevaluates a list of score functions, the number of which grows as low aslinearly and as high as exponentially with the number of arms. This can beprohibitive in the regime of a large number of arms. This paper introduces anovel realistic alternative to the perfect oracle. This algorithm uses acombination of group-testing for selecting the super arms and quantizedThompson sampling for parameter estimation. Under a general separabilityassumption on the reward function, the proposed algorithm reduces thecomplexity of the super-arm-selection oracle to be logarithmic in the number ofbase arms while achieving the same regret order as the state-of-the-artalgorithms that use exact oracles. This translates to at least an exponentialreduction in complexity compared to the oracle-based approaches.</description><author>Arpan Mukherjee, Shashanka Ubaru, Keerthiram Murugesan, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Ali Tajer</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 16:19:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10679v1</guid></item><item><title>Both Ears Wide Open: Towards Language-Driven Spatial Audio Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10676v1</link><description>Recently, diffusion models have achieved great success in mono-channel audiogeneration. However, when it comes to stereo audio generation, the soundscapesoften have a complex scene of multiple objects and directions. Controllingstereo audio with spatial contexts remains challenging due to high data costsand unstable generative models. To the best of our knowledge, this workrepresents the first attempt to address these issues. We first construct alarge-scale, simulation-based, and GPT-assisted dataset, BEWO-1M, with abundantsoundscapes and descriptions even including moving and multiple sources. Beyondtext modality, we have also acquired a set of images and rationally pairedstereo audios through retrieval to advance multimodal generation. Existingaudio generation models tend to generate rather random and indistinct spatialaudio. To provide accurate guidance for latent diffusion models, we introducethe SpatialSonic model utilizing spatial-aware encoders and azimuth statematrices to reveal reasonable spatial guidance. By leveraging spatial guidance,our unified model not only achieves the objective of generating immersive andcontrollable spatial audio from text and image but also enables interactiveaudio generation during inference. Finally, under fair settings, we conductsubjective and objective evaluations on simulated and real-world data tocompare our approach with prevailing methods. The results demonstrate theeffectiveness of our method, highlighting its capability to generate spatialaudio that adheres to physical rules.</description><author>Peiwen Sun, Sitong Cheng, Xiangtai Li, Zhen Ye, Huadai Liu, Honggang Zhang, Wei Xue, Yike Guo</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 16:18:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10676v1</guid></item><item><title>Shadowcast: Stealthy Data Poisoning Attacks Against Vision-Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06659v2</link><description>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in generating textual responses fromvisual inputs, but their versatility raises security concerns. This study takesthe first step in exposing VLMs' susceptibility to data poisoning attacks thatcan manipulate responses to innocuous, everyday prompts. We introduceShadowcast, a stealthy data poisoning attack where poison samples are visuallyindistinguishable from benign images with matching texts. Shadowcastdemonstrates effectiveness in two attack types. The first is a traditionalLabel Attack, tricking VLMs into misidentifying class labels, such as confusingDonald Trump for Joe Biden. The second is a novel Persuasion Attack, leveragingVLMs' text generation capabilities to craft persuasive and seemingly rationalnarratives for misinformation, such as portraying junk food as healthy. We showthat Shadowcast effectively achieves the attacker's intentions using as few as50 poison samples. Crucially, the poisoned samples demonstrate transferabilityacross different VLM architectures, posing a significant concern in black-boxsettings. Moreover, Shadowcast remains potent under realistic conditionsinvolving various text prompts, training data augmentation, and imagecompression techniques. This work reveals how poisoned VLMs can disseminateconvincing yet deceptive misinformation to everyday, benign users, emphasizingthe importance of data integrity for responsible VLM deployments.

However, successful applications toreal-world problems remain limited. One reason for this dichotomy is becausethe learned policies are not robust to observation noise or adversarialattacks. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of deep RL policies to asingle small state perturbation in deterministic continuous control tasks. Wedemonstrate that RL policies can be deterministically chaotic as smallperturbations to the system state have a large impact on subsequent state andreward trajectories. This unstable non-linear behaviour has two consequences:First, inaccuracies in sensor readings, or adversarial attacks, can causesignificant performance degradation; Second, even policies that show robustperformance in terms of rewards may have unpredictable behaviour in practice.These two facets of chaos in RL policies drastically restrict the applicationof deep RL to real-world problems. To address this issue, we propose animprovement on the successful Dreamer V3 architecture, implementing a MaximalLyapunov Exponent regularisation. This new approach reduces the chaotic statedynamics, rendering the learnt policies more resilient to sensor noise oradversarial attacks and thereby improving the suitability of Deep ReinforcementLearning for real-world applications.</description><author>Rory Young, Nicolas Pugeault</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 16:16:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10674v1</guid></item><item><title>Large Language Model Evaluation via Matrix Nuclear-Norm</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10672v1</link><description>As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, efficient evaluationmetrics are vital for assessing their ability to compress information andreduce redundancy. While traditional metrics like Matrix Entropy offer valuableinsights, they are computationally intensive for large-scale models due totheir \( O(n^3) \) time complexity with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Tomitigate this issue, we introduce the Matrix Nuclear-Norm, which not onlyserves as a metric to quantify the data compression proficiency of LLM but alsoprovides a convex approximation of matrix rank to capture both predictivediscriminability and diversity. By employing the \( L_{1,2}\text{-norm} \) tofurther approximate the nuclear norm, we can effectively assess the model'sinformation compression capabilities. This approach reduces the time complexityto \( O(n^2) \) and eliminates the need for SVD computation. Consequently, theMatrix Nuclear-Norm achieves speeds 8 to 24 times faster than Matrix Entropyfor the CEREBRAS-GPT model as sizes increase from 111M to 6.7B. Thisperformance gap becomes more pronounced with larger models, as validated intests with other models like Pythia. Additionally, evaluations on benchmarksand model responses confirm that our proposed Matrix Nuclear-Norm is areliable, scalable, and efficient tool for assessing LLMs' performance,striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

However, our analysis of FLORES-200,FLORES+, Ethnologue, and World Development Indicators data reveals that thesebenefits largely favor English speakers. Speakers of languages in low-incomeand lower-middle-income countries face higher costs when using OpenAI's GPTmodels via APIs because of how the system processes the input -- tokenization.Around 1.5 billion people, speaking languages primarily fromlower-middle-income countries, could incur costs that are 4 to 6 times higherthan those faced by English speakers. Disparities in LLM performance aresignificant, and tokenization in models priced per token amplifies inequalitiesin access, cost, and utility. Moreover, using the quality of translation tasksas a proxy measure, we show that LLMs perform poorly in low-resource languages,presenting a ``double jeopardy" of higher costs and poor performance for theseusers. We also discuss the direct impact of fragmentation in tokenizinglow-resource languages on climate.

However, real-world data areinherently multi-modal, and unimodal approaches limit the practicalapplications of few-shot learning. To address this gap, this paper introducesthe Cross-modal Few-Shot Learning (CFSL) task, which aims to recognizeinstances from multiple modalities when only a few labeled examples areavailable. This task presents additional challenges compared to classicalfew-shot learning due to the distinct visual characteristics and structuralproperties unique to each modality. To tackle these challenges, we propose aGenerative Transfer Learning (GTL) framework consisting of two stages: thefirst stage involves training on abundant unimodal data, and the second stagefocuses on transfer learning to adapt to novel data. Our GTL framework jointlyestimates the latent shared concept across modalities and in-modalitydisturbance in both stages, while freezing the generative module during thetransfer phase to maintain the stability of the learned representations andprevent overfitting to the limited multi-modal samples. Our finds demonstratethat GTL has superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods acrossfour distinct multi-modal datasets: Sketchy, TU-Berlin, Mask1K, and SKSF-A.Additionally, the results suggest that the model can estimate latent conceptsfrom vast unimodal data and generalize these concepts to unseen modalitiesusing only a limited number of available samples, much like human cognitiveprocesses.</description><author>Zhengwei Yang, Yuke Li, Qiang Sun, Basura Fernando, Heng Huang, Zheng Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 16:09:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10663v1</guid></item><item><title>Transforming Game Play: A Comparative Study of DCQN and DTQN Architectures in Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10660v1</link><description>In this study, we investigate the performance of Deep Q-Networks utilizingConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures across threedifferent Atari games.

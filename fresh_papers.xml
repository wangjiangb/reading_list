One of the most popularattribution scores is the SHAP score, which is an instantiation of the generalShapley value used in coalition game theory. The definition of this scorerelies on a probability distribution on the entity population. Since the exactdistribution is generally unknown, it needs to be assigned subjectively or beestimated from data, which may lead to misleading feature scores. In thispaper, we propose a principled framework for reasoning on SHAP scores underunknown entity population distributions. In our framework, we consider anuncertainty region that contains the potential distributions, and the SHAPscore of a feature becomes a function defined over this region. We study thebasic problems of finding maxima and minima of this function, which allows usto determine tight ranges for the SHAP scores of all features. In particular,we pinpoint the complexity of these problems, and other related ones, showingthem to be NP-complete. Finally, we present experiments on a real-worlddataset, showing that our framework may contribute to a more robust featurescoring.</description><author>Santiago Cifuentes, Leopoldo Bertossi, Nina Pardal, Sergio Abriola, Maria Vanina Martinez, Miguel Romero</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 16:12:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12731v4</guid></item><item><title>FuxiTranyu: A Multilingual Large Language Model Trained with Balanced Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06273v2</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in a wide range oftasks. However, many LLMs exhibit significant performance discrepancies betweenhigh- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this challenge, we presentFuxiTranyu, an open-source multilingual LLM, which is designed to satisfy theneed of the research community for balanced and high-performing multilingualcapabilities. FuxiTranyu-8B, the base model with 8 billion parameters, istrained from scratch on a meticulously balanced multilingual data repositorythat contains 600 billion tokens covering 43 natural languages and 16programming languages. In addition to the base model, we also develop twoinstruction-tuned models: FuxiTranyu-8B-SFT that is fine-tuned on a diversemultilingual instruction dataset, and FuxiTranyu-8B-DPO that is further refinedwith DPO on a preference dataset for enhanced alignment ability. Extensiveexperiments on a wide range of multilingual benchmarks demonstrate thecompetitive performance of FuxiTranyu against existing multilingual LLMs, e.g.,BLOOM-7B, PolyLM-13B, Llama-2-Chat-7B and Mistral-7B-Instruct. Interpretabilityanalyses at both the neuron and representation level suggest that FuxiTranyu isable to learn consistent multilingual representations across differentlanguages. To promote further research into multilingual LLMs and their workingmechanisms, we release both the base and instruction-tuned FuxiTranyu modelstogether with 58 pretraining checkpoints at HuggingFace and Github.</description><author>Haoran Sun, Renren Jin, Shaoyang Xu, Leiyu Pan, Supryadi, Menglong Cui, Jiangcun Du, Yikun Lei, Lei Yang, Ling Shi, Juesi Xiao, Shaolin Zhu, Deyi Xiong</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 14:57:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06273v2</guid></item><item><title>A Universal Flexible Near-sensor Neuromorphic Tactile System with Multi-threshold strategy for Pressure Characteristic Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05846v2</link><description>Constructing the new generation information processing system by mimickingbiological nervous system is a feasible way for implement of high-efficientintelligent sensing device and bionic robot. However, most biological nervoussystem, especially the tactile system, have various powerful functions. This isa big challenge for bionic system design. Here we report a universal fullyflexible neuromorphic tactile perception system with strong compatibility and amultithreshold signal processing strategy.

Existing works typically involve extracting globalfeatures from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiersto detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous eventstend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames,which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by thedominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detectedanomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method calledSTPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervisedvideo anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trainedvision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream networkstructure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the otherprimarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge frompre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, ourmodel learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions ofvideos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regionsof anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating theinfluence of background information. Without relying on detailedspatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our methodachieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADLtask.</description><author>Peng Wu, Xuerong Zhou, Guansong Pang, Zhiwei Yang, Qingsen Yan, Peng Wang, Yanning Zhang</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 13:55:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05905v2</guid></item><item><title>Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461v4</link><description>Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) is a theoretical frameworkaddressing data fragmentation and siloing challenges, enabling scalable AIthrough data sovereignty.

We discover thattraditional continual training results in severe catastrophic forgetting,failing to outperform a zero-shot segmentation baseline. We introduce a noveltraining-free strategy, kNN-CLIP, which augments the model with a database ofinstance embeddings for semantic and panoptic segmentation that achieves zeroforgetting. We demonstrate that kNN-CLIP can adapt to continually growingvocabularies without the need for retraining or large memory costs. kNN-CLIPenables open-vocabulary segmentation methods to expand their vocabularies onany domain with a single pass through the data, while only storing compactembeddings. This approach minimizes both compute and memory costs. kNN-CLIPachieves state-of-the-art performance across large-vocabulary semantic andpanoptic segmentation datasets. We hope kNN-CLIP represents a significant stepforward in enabling more efficient and adaptable continual segmentation, pavingthe way for advances in real-world large-vocabulary continual segmentationmethods.</description><author>Zhongrui Gui, Shuyang Sun, Runjia Li, Jianhao Yuan, Zhaochong An, Karsten Roth, Ameya Prabhu, Philip Torr</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 13:24:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09447v3</guid></item><item><title>Neural Architecture Search based Global-local Vision Mamba for Palm-Vein Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05743v2</link><description>Due to the advantages such as high security, high privacy, and livenessrecognition, vein recognition has been received more and more attention in pastyears. Recently, deep learning models, e.g., Mamba has shown robust featurerepresentation with linear computational complexity and successfully appliedfor visual tasks. However, vision Manba can capture long-distance featuredependencies but unfortunately deteriorate local feature details. Besides,manually designing a Mamba architecture based on human priori knowledge is verytime-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, first, we propose a hybridnetwork structure named Global-local Vision Mamba (GLVM), to learn the localcorrelations in images explicitly and global dependencies among tokens for veinfeature representation. Secondly, we design a Multi-head Mamba to learn thedependencies along different directions, so as to improve the featurerepresentation ability of vision Mamba. Thirdly, to learn the complementaryfeatures, we propose a ConvMamba block consisting of three branches, namedMulti-head Mamba branch (MHMamba), Feature Iteration Unit branch (FIU), andConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) branch, where the Feature Iteration Unitbranch aims to fuse convolutional local features with Mamba-based globalrepresentations. Finally, a Globallocal Alternate Neural Architecture Search(GLNAS) method is proposed to search the optimal architecture of GLVMalternately with the evolutionary algorithm, thereby improving the recognitionperformance for vein recognition tasks. We conduct rigorous experiments onthree public palm-vein databases to estimate the performance. The experimentalresults demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the representativeapproaches and achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy.</description><author>Huafeng Qin, Yuming Fu, Jing Chen, Mounim A.

Analyzing this high-dimensional data and identifying relevantpredictors pose substantial challenges, especially when data is preferred toremain on the device where it was collected for reasons such as data integrity,communication bandwidth, and privacy. This paper introduces a federatedquantile regression algorithm to address these challenges. Quantile regressionprovides a more comprehensive view of the relationship between variables thanmean regression models. However, traditional approaches face difficulties whendealing with nonconvex sparse penalties and the inherent non-smoothness of theloss function. For this purpose, we propose a federated smoothing proximalgradient (FSPG) algorithm that integrates a smoothing mechanism with theproximal gradient framework, thereby enhancing both precision and computationalspeed. This integration adeptly handles optimization over a network of devices,each holding local data samples, making it particularly effective in federatedlearning scenarios. The FSPG algorithm ensures steady progress and reliableconvergence in each iteration by maintaining or reducing the value of theobjective function. By leveraging nonconvex penalties, such as the minimaxconcave penalty (MCP) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), theproposed method can identify and preserve key predictors within sparse models.Comprehensive simulations validate the robust theoretical foundations of theproposed algorithm and demonstrate improved estimation precision and reliableconvergence.</description><author>Reza Mirzaeifard, Diyako Ghaderyan, Stefan Werner</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 11:52:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05640v2</guid></item><item><title>MLAAN: Scaling Supervised Local Learning with Multilaminar Leap Augmented Auxiliary Network</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16633v3</link><description>Deep neural networks (DNNs) typically employ an end-to-end (E2E) trainingparadigm which presents several challenges, including high GPU memoryconsumption, inefficiency, and difficulties in model parallelization duringtraining. Recent research has sought to address these issues, with onepromising approach being local learning. This method involves partitioning thebackbone network into gradient-isolated modules and manually designingauxiliary networks to train these local modules. Existing methods often neglectthe interaction of information between local modules, leading to myopic issuesand a performance gap compared to E2E training. To address these limitations,we propose the Multilaminar Leap Augmented Auxiliary Network (MLAAN).Specifically, MLAAN comprises Multilaminar Local Modules (MLM) and LeapAugmented Modules (LAM). MLM captures both local and global features throughindependent and cascaded auxiliary networks, alleviating performance issuescaused by insufficient global features. However, overly simplistic auxiliarynetworks can impede MLM's ability to capture global information. To addressthis, we further design LAM, an enhanced auxiliary network that uses theExponential Moving Average (EMA) method to facilitate information exchangebetween local modules, thereby mitigating the shortsightedness resulting frominadequate interaction. The synergy between MLM and LAM has demonstratedexcellent performance. Our experiments on the CIFAR-10, STL-10, SVHN, andImageNet datasets show that MLAAN can be seamlessly integrated into existinglocal learning frameworks, significantly enhancing their performance and evensurpassing end-to-end (E2E) training methods, while also reducing GPU memoryconsumption.</description><author>Yuming Zhang, Shouxin Zhang, Peizhe Wang, Feiyu Zhu, Dongzhi Guan, Junhao Su, Jiabin Liu, Changpeng Cai</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 11:35:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16633v3</guid></item><item><title>Review-driven Personalized Preference Reasoning with Large Language Models for Recommendation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06276v2</link><description>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstratedexceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, generating significantinterest in their application to recommendation systems. However, existingmethods have not fully capitalized on the potential of LLMs, often constrainedby limited input information or failing to fully utilize their advancedreasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce EXP3RT, anovel LLM-based recommender designed to leverage rich preference informationcontained in user and item reviews. EXP3RT is basically fine-tuned throughdistillation from a teacher LLM to perform three key tasks in order: EXP3RTfirst extracts and encapsulates essential subjective preferences from rawreviews, aggregates and summarizes them according to specific criteria tocreate user and item profiles. It then generates detailed step-by-stepreasoning followed by predicted rating, i.e., reasoning-enhanced ratingprediction, by considering both subjective and objective information fromuser/item profiles and item descriptions. This personalized preferencereasoning from EXP3RT enhances rating prediction accuracy and also providesfaithful and reasonable explanations for recommendation. Extensive experimentsshow that EXP3RT outperforms existing methods on both rating prediction andcandidate item reranking for top-k recommendation, while significantlyenhancing the explainability of recommendation systems.</description><author>Jieyong Kim, Hyunseo Kim, Hyunjin Cho, SeongKu Kang, Buru Chang, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 11:05:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06276v2</guid></item><item><title>SWIFT:A Scalable lightWeight Infrastructure for Fine-Tuning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05517v2</link><description>Recent development in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-modal LargeLanguage Models (MLLMs) have leverage Attention-based Transformer architecturesand achieved superior performance and generalization capabilities. They havesince covered extensive areas of traditional learning tasks. For instance,text-based tasks such as text-classification and sequence-labeling, as well asmulti-modal tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Optical CharacterRecognition (OCR), which were previously addressed using different models, cannow be tackled based on one foundation model. Consequently, the training andlightweight fine-tuning of LLMs and MLLMs, especially those based onTransformer architecture, has become particularly important. In recognition ofthese overwhelming needs, we develop SWIFT, a customizable one-stopinfrastructure for large models. With support of over $300+$ LLMs and $50+$MLLMs, SWIFT stands as the open-source framework that provide the \textit{mostcomprehensive support} for fine-tuning large models. In particular, it is thefirst training framework that provides systematic support for MLLMs. Inaddition to the core functionalities of fine-tuning, SWIFT also integratespost-training processes such as inference, evaluation, and model quantization,to facilitate fast adoptions of large models in various application scenarios.With a systematic integration of various training techniques, SWIFT offershelpful utilities such as benchmark comparisons among different trainingtechniques for large models. For fine-tuning models specialized in agentframework, we show that notable improvements on the ToolBench leader-board canbe achieved by training with customized dataset on SWIFT, with an increase of5.2%-21.8% in the Act.EM metric over various baseline models, a reduction inhallucination by 1.6%-14.1%, and an average performance improvement of 8%-17%.</description><author>Yuze Zhao, Jintao Huang, Jinghan Hu, Xingjun Wang, Yunlin Mao, Daoze Zhang, Zeyinzi Jiang, Zhikai Wu, Baole Ai, Ang Wang, Wenmeng Zhou, Yingda Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 09:22:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05517v2</guid></item><item><title>Performance Evaluation of YOLOv8 Model Configurations, for Instance Segmentation of Strawberry Fruit Development Stages in an Open Field Environment</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05661v2</link><description>Accurate identification of strawberries during their maturing stages iscrucial for optimizing yield management, and pest control, and making informeddecisions related to harvest and post-harvest logistics. This study evaluatesthe performance of YOLOv8 model configurations for instance segmentation ofstrawberries into ripe and unripe stages in an open field environment.

Atthe core of our EasyInv is a refined strategy for approximating inversionnoise, which is pivotal for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of theinversion process. By prioritizing the initial latent state, which encapsulatesrich information about the original images, EasyInv steers clear of theiterative refinement of noise items. Instead, we introduce a methodicalaggregation of the latent state from the preceding time step with the currentstate, effectively increasing the influence of the initial latent state andmitigating the impact of noise. We illustrate that EasyInv is capable ofdelivering results that are either on par with or exceed those of theconventional DDIM Inversion approach, especially under conditions where themodel's precision is limited or computational resources are scarce.Concurrently, our EasyInv offers an approximate threefold enhancement regardinginference efficiency over off-the-shelf iterative optimization techniques.</description><author>Ziyue Zhang, Mingbao Lin, Shuicheng Yan, Rongrong Ji</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 08:23:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05159v2</guid></item><item><title>mPLUG-Owl3: Towards Long Image-Sequence Understanding in Multi-Modal Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04840v2</link><description>Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkablecapabilities in executing instructions for a variety of single-image tasks.Despite this progress, significant challenges remain in modeling long imagesequences.

The MLM is obtained by leveraging softmax outputs andclustering techniques to measure the distances between the predictions of atrained neural network and class centroids. By analyzing these distances, theMLM provides a comprehensive view of the model's misclassification tendencies,enabling decision-makers to identify the most common and critical sources oferrors. The MLM allows for the prioritization of model improvements and theestablishment of decision thresholds based on acceptable risk levels. Theapproach is evaluated on the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and a perturbed version of the dataset to simulate distribution shifts.The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MLM in assessing thereliability of predictions and highlight its potential in enhancing theinterpretability and risk mitigation capabilities of neural networks.

These applications naturallyrequire i) handling streaming-in inference requests and ii) fine-tuning thedeployed models to adapt to possible deployment scenario changes. Continuallearning (CL) is widely adopted to satisfy these needs. CL is a popular deeplearning paradigm that handles both continuous model fine-tuning and overtimeinference requests. However, an inappropriate model fine-tuning scheme couldinvolve significant redundancy and consume considerable time and energy, makingit challenging to apply CL on edge devices. In this paper, we propose ETuner,an efficient edge continual learning framework that optimizes inferenceaccuracy, fine-tuning execution time, and energy efficiency through bothinter-tuning and intra-tuning optimizations. Experimental results show that, onaverage, ETuner reduces overall fine-tuning execution time by 64%, energyconsumption by 56%, and improves average inference accuracy by 1.75% over theimmediate model fine-tuning approach.</description><author>Sheng Li, Geng Yuan, Yawen Wu, Yue Dai, Tianyu Wang, Chao Wu, Alex K.

However, it can develop defects that affect theoptoelectronic performance whether in the production preparation or in actualuse. The development of in-situ non-destructive testing (NDT) devices formetallic mesh requires long working distances, reflective optical path design,and miniaturization. To address the limitations of existing smartphonemicroscopes, which feature short working distances and inadequate transmissionimaging for industrial in-situ inspection, we propose a novel long-workingdistance reflective smartphone microscopy system (LD-RSM). LD-RSM builds a 4foptical imaging system with external optical components and a smartphone,utilizing a beam splitter to achieve reflective imaging with the illuminationsystem and imaging system on the same side of the sample. It achieves anoptical resolution of 4.92$\mu$m and a working distance of up to 22.23 mm.Additionally, we introduce a dual prior weighted Robust Principal ComponentAnalysis (DW-RPCA) for defect detection. This approach leverages spectralfilter fusion and Hough transform to model different defect types, enhancingthe accuracy and efficiency of defect identification.

This study investigates the performance of theLaplacian-based Quantum Semi-Supervised Learning (QSSL) method across fourbenchmark datasets -- Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, and Heart Disease.Further analysis explores the impact of increasing Qubit counts, revealing thatadding more Qubits to a quantum system doesn't always improve performance. Theeffectiveness of additional Qubits depends on the quantum algorithm and howwell it matches the dataset. Additionally, we examine the effects of varyingentangling layers on entanglement entropy and test accuracy. The performance ofLaplacian learning is highly dependent on the number of entangling layers, withoptimal configurations varying across different datasets. Typically, moderatelevels of entanglement offer the best balance between model complexity andgeneralization capabilities. These observations highlight the crucial need forprecise hyperparameter tuning tailored to each dataset to achieve optimalperformance in Laplacian learning methods.</description><author>Hamed Gholipour, Farid Bozorgnia, Kailash Hambarde, Hamzeh Mohammadigheymasi, Javier Mancilla, Andre Sequeira, Joao Neves, Hugo Proença</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 04:04:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05498v2</guid></item><item><title>Decentralized Intelligence Health Network (DIHN)</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06240v2</link><description>Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN) is a theoretical frameworkaddressing significant challenges of health data sovereignty and AI utilizationin healthcare caused by data fragmentation across providers and institutions.It establishes a sovereign architecture for healthcare provision as aprerequisite to a sovereign health network, then facilitates effective AIutilization by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse medical data sources.This comprehensive framework leverages: 1) self-sovereign identity architecturecoupled with a personal health record (PHR) as a prerequisite for health datasovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning (FL) protocol implemented on apublic blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare, where healthdata remains with participants and only model parameter updates are shared; and3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism to incentivize participation andensure fair reward distribution.

Our study investigates this issue by developing a framework tosystematically study and quantify position bias using metrics such asrepetitional consistency, positional consistency, and positional fairness. Weconduct experiments with 9 judge models across 22 tasks from the MTBench andDevBench benchmarks and nearly 40 answer-generating models, generatingapproximately 80,000 evaluation instances. This comprehensive assessmentreveals significant variations in bias across judges and tasks. Although GPT-4often excels in positional consistency and fairness, some more cost-effectivemodels perform comparably or even better in specific tasks, highlightingessential trade-offs between consistency, fairness, and cost. Our results alsodemonstrate high consistency of judgment across repetitions, confirming thatposition bias is not due to random variations. This research significantlycontributes to the field by introducing new concepts for understanding positionbias and providing a multi-dimensional framework for evaluation. These insightsguide the selection of optimal judge models, enhance benchmark design, and laythe foundation for future research into effective debiasing strategies,ultimately enhancing the reliability of LLM evaluators.</description><author>Lin Shi, Chiyu Ma, Weicheng Ma, Soroush Vosoughi</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 02:52:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07791v3</guid></item><item><title>ClickAttention: Click Region Similarity Guided Interactive Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06021v2</link><description>Interactive segmentation algorithms based on click points have garneredsignificant attention from researchers in recent years.

Inaddition, most existing algorithms can not balance well between highperformance and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a click attentionalgorithm that expands the influence range of positive clicks based on thesimilarity between positively-clicked regions and the whole input. We alsopropose a discriminative affinity loss to reduce the attention coupling betweenpositive and negative click regions to avoid an accuracy decrease caused bymutual interference between positive and negative clicks.

However, general guidance to model architecture design is stillmissing. The design of many modern model architectures, such as residualstructures, multiplicative gating signal, and feed-forward networks, can beinterpreted in terms of the heat conduction equation. This finding inspired usto model images by the heat conduction equation, where the essential idea is toconceptualize image features as temperatures and model their informationinteraction as the diffusion of thermal energy. We can take advantage of therich knowledge in the heat conduction equation to guide us in designing new andmore interpretable models. As an example, we propose Heat Conduction Layer andRefine Approximation Layer inspired by solving the heat conduction equationusing Finite Difference Method and Fourier series, respectively. This paperdoes not aim to present a state-of-the-art model; instead, it seeks tointegrate the overall architectural design of the model into the heatconduction theory framework. Nevertheless, our Heat Conduction Network (HcNet)still shows competitive performance.

Despite their success, they also haveinherent limitations such as a lack of up-to-date knowledge and hallucination.Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique tomitigate these limitations. The key idea of RAG is to ground the answergeneration of an LLM on external knowledge retrieved from a knowledge database.Existing studies mainly focus on improving the accuracy or efficiency of RAG,leaving its security largely unexplored. We aim to bridge the gap in this work.We find that the knowledge database in a RAG system introduces a new andpractical attack surface. Based on this attack surface, we propose PoisonedRAG,the first knowledge corruption attack to RAG, where an attacker could inject afew malicious texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce anLLM to generate an attacker-chosen target answer for an attacker-chosen targetquestion. We formulate knowledge corruption attacks as an optimization problem,whose solution is a set of malicious texts. Depending on the backgroundknowledge (e.g., black-box and white-box settings) of an attacker on a RAGsystem, we propose two solutions to solve the optimization problem,respectively. Our results show PoisonedRAG could achieve a 90% attack successrate when injecting five malicious texts for each target question into aknowledge database with millions of texts. We also evaluate several defensesand our results show they are insufficient to defend against PoisonedRAG,highlighting the need for new defenses.</description><author>Wei Zou, Runpeng Geng, Binghui Wang, Jinyuan Jia</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 01:55:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07867v3</guid></item><item><title>On the Impact of Calibration Data in Post-training Quantization and Pruning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09755v2</link><description>Quantization and pruning form the foundation of compression for neuralnetworks, enabling efficient inference for large language models (LLMs).Recently, various quantization and pruning techniques have demonstratedremarkable performance in a post-training setting.

In response, this paper proposes a novel "Formal-LLM"framework for LLM-based agents by integrating the expressiveness of naturallanguage and the precision of formal language. Specifically, the frameworkallows agent developers to express their requirements or constraints for theplanning process as an automaton. A stack-based LLM plan generation process isthen conducted under the supervision of the automaton to ensure that thegenerated plan satisfies the constraints, making the planning processcontrollable. We conduct experiments on both benchmark tasks and practicalreal-life tasks, and our framework achieves over 50% overall performanceincrease, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of employingFormal-LLM to guide the plan generation of agents, preventing the agents fromgenerating invalid and unsuccessful plans. Further, more controllable LLM-basedagents can facilitate the broader utilization of LLM in application scenarioswhere high validity of planning is essential.

In thiswork, we assemble 15 LLMs of four different size ranges and evaluate theiroutput responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, suchas System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality ofranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators(CoBBLEr), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLMevaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rankits own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text qualityevaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40%of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations thatquestion their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine thecorrelation between human and machine preferences and calculate the averageRank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machinepreferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs maystill be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with humanpreferences.

AI has also introduced tools and methods that automatemany tasks previously performed by human labor with the help of computervision, including health inspections. Among these methods, pose estimation hasa special place; pose estimation is the process of finding the position ofjoints in an image of animals. Analyzing the pose of animal subjects enablesprecise identification and tracking of the animal's movement and the movementsof its body parts. By summarizing the video and imagery data into movement andjoint location using pose estimation and then analyzing this information, wecan address the scalability challenge in cattle management, focusing on healthmonitoring, behavioural phenotyping and welfare concerns. Our study reviewsrecent advancements in pose estimation methodologies, their applicability inimproving the cattle industry, existing challenges, and gaps in this field.Furthermore, we propose an initiative to enhance open science frameworks withinthis field of study by launching a platform designed to connect industry andacademia.</description><author>Navid Ghassemi, Ali Goldani, Ian Q.

Current models typically incorporate the FiDframework, which is composed by a neural retriever alongside an encoder-decoderneural reader. In the answer generation process, the retriever will retrievenumerous passages (around 100 for instance), each of which is then individuallyencoded by the encoder. Subsequently, the decoder makes predictions based onthese encoded passages. Nevertheless, this framework can be relativelytime-consuming, particularly due to the extensive length of the gatheredpassages. To address this, we introduce FastFiD in this paper, a novel approachthat executes sentence selection on the encoded passages. This aids inretaining valuable sentences while reducing the context length required forgenerating answers. Experiments on three commonly used datasets (NaturalQuestions, TriviaQA and ASQA) demonstrate that our method can enhance theinference speed by 2.3X-5.7X, while simultaneously maintaining the model'sperformance. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of the model's attention revealsthat the selected sentences indeed hold a substantial contribution towards thefinal answer.

Although animacy appears in language vianuanced constraints on verbs and adjectives, it is also learned and refinedthrough extralinguistic information. Similarly, we assume that the LLMs'limited abilities to understand natural language when processing animacy aremotivated by the fact that these models are trained exclusively on text. Hence, the question this paper aims to answer arises: can LLMs, in theirdigital wisdom, process animacy in a similar way to what humans would do? Wethen propose a systematic analysis via prompting approaches. In particular, weprobe different LLMs by prompting them using animate, inanimate, usual, andstranger contexts. Results reveal that, although LLMs have been trainedpredominantly on textual data, they exhibit human-like behavior when faced withtypical animate and inanimate entities in alignment with earlier studies.Hence, LLMs can adapt to understand unconventional situations by recognizingoddities as animated without needing to interface with unspoken cognitivetriggers humans rely on to break down animations.</description><author>Leonardo Ranaldi, Giulia Pucci, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 17:48:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06332v1</guid></item><item><title>HeLiMOS: A Dataset for Moving Object Segmentation in 3D Point Clouds From Heterogeneous LiDAR Sensors</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06328v1</link><description>Moving object segmentation (MOS) using a 3D light detection and ranging(LiDAR) sensor is crucial for scene understanding and identification of movingobjects. Despite the availability of various types of 3D LiDAR sensors in themarket, MOS research still predominantly focuses on 3D point clouds frommechanically spinning omnidirectional LiDAR sensors.

However, such neural approaches overlook symmetry which is acrucial inductive bias for model generalization. This oversight is notablebecause (i) physical laws adhere to symmetry principles when considering thegravity axis, meaning there exists the same transformation for both thephysical entity and the resulting trajectory, and (ii) displacements shouldremain equivariant to frame transformations when the inertial frame changes. Toaddress this, we propose a subequivariant framework by: (i) derivingfundamental layers such as linear and nonlinear layers for a subequivariantnetwork, designed to handle sequences of vectors and scalars, (ii) employingthe subequivariant network to predict an equivariant frame for the sequence ofinertial measurements. This predicted frame can then be utilized for extractinginvariant features through projection, which are integrated with arbitrarynetwork architectures, (iii) transforming the invariant output by frametransformation to obtain equivariant displacements and covariances.

However, they pose a heightened risk of exposure to explicitcontent, raising growing concerns for the online safety of children andadolescents. Despite these concerns, few studies have addressed the issue ofillicit image-based promotions of unsafe UGCGs on social media, which caninadvertently attract young users. This challenge arises from the difficulty ofobtaining comprehensive training data for UGCG images and the unique nature ofthese images, which differ from traditional unsafe content. In this work, wetake the first step towards studying the threat of illicit promotions of unsafeUGCGs. We collect a real-world dataset comprising 2,924 images that displaydiverse sexually explicit and violent content used to promote UGCGs by theirgame creators.

A prerequisitefor distributed GNN training is to partition the input graph into smaller partsthat are distributed among multiple machines of a compute cluster. Althoughgraph partitioning has been studied with regard to graph analytics and graphdatabases, its effect on GNN training performance is largely unexplored. As aconsequence, it is unclear whether investing computational efforts intohigh-quality graph partitioning would pay off in GNN training scenarios. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of graph partitioning fordistributed GNN training. Our study aims to understand how different factorssuch as GNN parameters, mini-batch size, graph type, features size, andscale-out factor influence the effectiveness of graph partitioning. We conductexperiments with two different GNN systems using vertex and edge partitioning.We found that high-quality graph partitioning is a very effective optimizationto speed up GNN training and to reduce memory consumption. Furthermore, ourresults show that invested partitioning time can quickly be amortized byreduced GNN training time, making it a relevant optimization for most GNNscenarios. Compared to research on distributed graph processing, our studyreveals that graph partitioning plays an even more significant role indistributed GNN training, which motivates further research on the graphpartitioning problem.</description><author>Nikolai Merkel, Daniel Stoll, Ruben Mayer, Hans-Arno Jacobsen</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 17:02:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15602v2</guid></item><item><title>Non-Stationary Latent Auto-Regressive Bandits</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03110v2</link><description>We consider the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with non-stationaryrewards.

This paper presents the firstcomprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enablingfrontier large language models to perform research independently andcommunicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generatesnovel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results,describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs asimulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can berepeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like thehuman scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it tothree distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling,transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea isimplemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 perpaper.

A natural extension is toconsider a setting where the matrix rows are partitioned into two groups, andthe goal is to choose a subset of columns that minimizes the maximumreconstruction error of both groups, relative to their respective best rank-kapproximation. Extending the known results of column subset selection to thisfair setting is not straightforward: in certain scenarios it is unavoidable tochoose columns separately for each group, resulting in double the expectedcolumn count. We propose a deterministic leverage-score sampling strategy forthe fair setting and show that sampling a column subset of minimum size becomesNP-hard in the presence of two groups. Despite these negative results, we givean approximation algorithm that guarantees a solution within 1.5 times theoptimal solution size.

However, existingsystems cannot accommodate individual surgeons' unique preferences andrequirements. Additionally, they primarily focus on general surgeries (e.g.,laparoscopy) and are unsuitable for highly precise microsurgeries, such asophthalmic procedures. Thus, we propose an image-guided approach forsurgeon-centered autonomous agents that can adapt to the individual surgeon'sskill level and preferred surgical techniques during ophthalmic cataractsurgery. Our approach trains reinforcement and imitation learning agentssimultaneously using curriculum learning approaches guided by image data toperform all tasks of the incision phase of cataract surgery. By integrating thesurgeon's actions and preferences into the training process, our approachenables the robot to implicitly learn and adapt to the individual surgeon'sunique techniques through surgeon-in-the-loop demonstrations. This results in amore intuitive and personalized surgical experience for the surgeon whileensuring consistent performance for the autonomous robotic apprentice.

We target theeffects of sampling frequency, and find an interesting tradeoff between errorand complexity of RL algorithm when tweaking the values of the time increment$\Delta$ $-$ as $\Delta$ becomes smaller, the error will be smaller but thecomplexity will be larger. We also study the two-player case under thegeneral-sum game framework and establish the convergence of Nash equilibrium tothe continuous-time game equilibrium as $\Delta\rightarrow0$.

For instance, in single-cellsequencing, scientists would like to learn how gene expression evolves overtime. But sequencing any cell destroys that cell. So we cannot access anycell's full trajectory, but we can access snapshot samples from many cells.Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to analyze systems withfull individual-trajectory access; since here we have only sample snapshots,these methods are inapplicable. The deep learning community has recentlyexplored using Schr\"odinger bridges (SBs) and their extensions to estimatethese dynamics. However, these methods either (1) interpolate between just twotime points or (2) require a single fixed reference dynamic within the SB,which is often just set to be Brownian motion. But learning piecewise fromadjacent time points can fail to capture long-term dependencies. Andpractitioners are typically able to specify a model class for the referencedynamic but not the exact values of the parameters within it. So we propose anew method that (1) learns the unobserved trajectories from sample snapshotsacross multiple time points and (2) requires specification only of a class ofreference dynamics, not a single fixed one. In particular, we suggest aniterative projection method inspired by Schr\"odinger bridges; we alternatebetween learning a piecewise SB on the unobserved trajectories and using thelearned SB to refine our best guess for the dynamics within the referenceclass. We demonstrate the advantages of our method via a well-known simulatedparametric model from ecology, simulated and real data from systems biology,and real motion-capture data.</description><author>Yunyi Shen, Renato Berlinghieri, Tamara Broderick</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 16:39:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06277v1</guid></item><item><title>Review-driven Personalized Preference Reasoning with Large Language Models for Recommendation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06276v1</link><description>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstratedexceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, generating significantinterest in their application to recommendation systems. However, existingmethods have not fully capitalized on the potential of LLMs, often constrainedby limited input information or failing to fully utilize their advancedreasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce EXP3RT, anovel LLM-based recommender designed to leverage rich preference informationcontained in user and item reviews. EXP3RT is basically fine-tuned throughdistillation from a teacher LLM to perform three key tasks in order: EXP3RTfirst extracts and encapsulates essential subjective preferences from rawreviews, aggregates and summarizes them according to specific criteria tocreate user and item profiles.

However, many LLMs exhibit significant performance discrepancies betweenhigh- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this challenge, we presentFuxiTranyu, an open-source multilingual LLM, which is designed to satisfy theneed of the research community for balanced and high-performing multilingualcapabilities. FuxiTranyu-8B, the base model with 8 billion parameters, istrained from scratch on a meticulously balanced multilingual data repositorythat contains 600 billion tokens covering 43 natural languages and 16programming languages. In addition to the base model, we also develop twoinstruction-tuned models: FuxiTranyu-8B-SFT that is fine-tuned on a diversemultilingual instruction dataset, and FuxiTranyu-8B-DPO that is further refinedwith DPO on a preference dataset for enhanced alignment ability. Extensiveexperiments on a wide range of multilingual benchmarks demonstrate thecompetitive performance of FuxiTranyu against existing multilingual LLMs, e.g.,BLOOM-7B, PolyLM-13B, Llama-2-Chat-7B and Mistral-7B-Instruct. Interpretabilityanalyses at both the neuron and representation level suggest that FuxiTranyu isable to learn consistent multilingual representations across differentlanguages. To promote further research into multilingual LLMs and their workingmechanisms, we release both the base and instruction-tuned FuxiTranyu modelstogether with 58 pretraining checkpoints at HuggingFace and Github.</description><author>Haoran Sun, Renren Jin, Shaoyang Xu, Leiyu Pan, Supryadi, Menglong Cui, Jiangcun Dui, Yikun Lei, Lei Yang, Ling Shi, Juesi Xiao, Shaolin Zhu, Deyi Xiong</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 16:34:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06273v1</guid></item><item><title>Anchored Preference Optimization and Contrastive Revisions: Addressing Underspecification in Alignment</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06266v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) are often aligned using contrastive alignmentobjectives and preference pair datasets. The interaction between model, paireddata, and objective makes alignment a complicated procedure, sometimesproducing subpar results. We study this and find that (i) preference data givesa better learning signal when the underlying responses are contrastive, and(ii) alignment objectives lead to better performance when they specify morecontrol over the model during training. Based on these insights, we introduceContrastive Learning from AI Revisions (CLAIR), a data-creation method whichleads to more contrastive preference pairs, and Anchored PreferenceOptimization (APO), a controllable and more stable alignment objective. Wealign Llama-3-8B-Instruct using various comparable datasets and alignmentobjectives and measure MixEval-Hard scores, which correlate highly with humanjudgments. The CLAIR preferences lead to the strongest performance out of alldatasets, and APO consistently outperforms less controllable objectives. Ourbest model, trained on 32K CLAIR preferences with APO, improvesLlama-3-8B-Instruct by 7.65%, closing the gap with GPT4-turbo by 45%.

To improve audio quality, anenhancement module, which can be developed independently, is explicitly used atthe front-end of the target audio applications. In this paper, we present anend-to-end learning solution to jointly optimise the models for audioenhancement (AE) and the subsequent applications. To guide the optimisation ofthe AE module towards a target application, and especially to overcomedifficult samples, we make use of the sample-wise performance measure as anindication of sample importance. In experiments, we consider fourrepresentative applications to evaluate our training paradigm, i.e., ASR,speech command recognition (SCR), speech emotion recognition (SER), and ASC.These applications are associated with speech and non-speech tasks concerningsemantic and non-semantic features, transient and global information, and theexperimental results indicate that our proposed approach can considerably boostthe noise robustness of the models, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios(SNRs), for a wide range of computer audition tasks in everyday-life noisyenvironments.</description><author>Manuel Milling, Shuo Liu, Andreas Triantafyllopoulos, Ilhan Aslan, Björn W.

Although discrete-timediscrete diffusion has been established for a while, only recently Campbell etal. (2022) introduced the first framework for continuous-time discretediffusion. However, their training and sampling processes differ significantlyfrom the discrete-time version, necessitating nontrivial approximations fortractability. In this paper, we first present a series of mathematicalsimplifications of the variational lower bound that enable more accurate andeasy-to-optimize training for discrete diffusion. In addition, we derive asimple formulation for backward denoising that enables exact and acceleratedsampling, and importantly, an elegant unification of discrete-time andcontinuous-time discrete diffusion. Thanks to simpler analytical formulations,both forward and now also backward probabilities can flexibly accommodate anynoise distribution, including different noise distributions for multi-elementobjects. Experiments show that our proposed USD3 (for Unified SimplifiedDiscrete Denoising Diffusion) outperform all SOTA baselines on establisheddatasets.

A novel Deep UNet++-based Ensemble (DUNE) neural architecture isintroduced, employing multi-encoder-decoder structures with residual blocks.When initialized from a prior month or year, this architecture produced thefirst AI-based global monthly, seasonal, or annual mean forecast of 2-metertemperatures (T2m) and sea surface temperatures (SST). ERA5 monthly mean datais used as input for T2m over land, SST over oceans, and solar radiation at thetop of the atmosphere for each month of 40 years to train the model. Validationforecasts are performed for an additional two years, followed by five years offorecast evaluations to account for natural annual variability. AI-trainedinference forecast weights generate forecasts in seconds, enabling ensembleseasonal forecasts. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Anomaly CorrelationCoefficient (ACC), and Heidke Skill Score (HSS) statistics are presentedglobally and over specific regions. These forecasts outperform persistence,climatology, and multiple linear regression for all domains. DUNE forecastsdemonstrate comparable statistical accuracy to NOAA's operational monthly andseasonal probabilistic outlook forecasts over the US but at significantlyhigher resolutions. RMSE and ACC error statistics for other recent AI-baseddaily forecasts also show superior performance for DUNE-based forecasts. TheDUNE model's application to an ensemble data assimilation cycle showscomparable forecast accuracy with a single high-resolution model, potentiallyeliminating the need for retraining on extrapolated datasets.</description><author>Pratik Shukla, Milton Halem</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 16:22:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06262v1</guid></item><item><title>Open-Source Molecular Processing Pipeline for Generating Molecules</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06261v1</link><description>Generative models for molecules have shown considerable promise for use incomputational chemistry, but remain difficult to use for non-experts.

MoMa processes images and text in arbitrary sequences by dividingexpert modules into modality-specific groups. These groups exclusively processdesignated tokens while employing learned routing within each group to maintainsemantically informed adaptivity. Our empirical results reveal substantialpre-training efficiency gains through this modality-specific parameterallocation. Under a 1-trillion-token training budget, the MoMa 1.4B model,featuring 4 text experts and 4 image experts, achieves impressive FLOPssavings: 3.7x overall, with 2.6x for text and 5.2x for image processingcompared to a compute-equivalent dense baseline, measured by pre-training loss.This outperforms the standard expert-choice MoE with 8 mixed-modal experts,which achieves 3x overall FLOPs savings (3x for text, 2.8x for image).Combining MoMa with mixture-of-depths (MoD) further improves pre-training FLOPssavings to 4.2x overall (text: 3.4x, image: 5.3x), although this combinationhurts performance in causal inference due to increased sensitivity to routeraccuracy.

Generativeartificial intelligence offers a promising solution by modeling datadistribution within compact latent space representations, thereby facilitatingfiner-grained explorations. In this work, we introduce MIMICRY, a novelblack-box system-agnostic test generator that leverages these latentrepresentations to generate frontier inputs for the DL systems under test.Specifically, MIMICRY uses style-based generative adversarial networks trainedto learn the representation of inputs with disentangled features. Thisrepresentation enables embedding style-mixing operations between a source and atarget input, combining their features to explore the boundary between them. Weevaluated the effectiveness of different MIMICRY configurations in generatingboundary inputs for four popular DL image classification systems.

We show thatall these algorithms do not only learn parameters from data but also viceversa: They iteratively alter training data in a way that depends on thecurrent model fit. We introduce reciprocal learning as a generalization ofthese algorithms using the language of decision theory. This allows us to studyunder what conditions they converge. The key is to guarantee that reciprocallearning contracts such that the Banach fixed-point theorem applies. In thisway, we find that reciprocal learning algorithms converge at linear rates to anapproximately optimal model under relatively mild assumptions on the lossfunction, if their predictions are probabilistic and the sample adaption isboth non-greedy and either randomized or regularized. We interpret thesefindings and provide corollaries that relate them to specific active learning,self-training, and bandit algorithms.</description><author>Julian Rodemann, Christoph Jansen, Georg Schollmeyer</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 16:14:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06257v1</guid></item><item><title>A Text-guided Protein Design Framework</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04611v3</link><description>Current AI-assisted protein design mainly utilizes protein sequential andstructural information.

To bridge this gap, we propose ProteinDT, a multi-modalframework that leverages textual descriptions for protein design.

To train ProteinDT, we construct a large dataset,SwissProtCLAP, with 441K text and protein pairs. We quantitatively verify theeffectiveness of ProteinDT on three challenging tasks: (1) over 90\% accuracyfor text-guided protein generation; (2) best hit ratio on 12 zero-shottext-guided protein editing tasks; (3) superior performance on four out of sixprotein property prediction benchmarks.</description><author>Shengchao Liu, Yanjing Li, Zhuoxinran Li, Anthony Gitter, Yutao Zhu, Jiarui Lu, Zhao Xu, Weili Nie, Arvind Ramanathan, Chaowei Xiao, Jian Tang, Hongyu Guo, Anima Anandkumar</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 16:05:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04611v3</guid></item><item><title>Rethinking Video with a Universal Event-Based Representation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06248v1</link><description>Traditionally, video is structured as a sequence of discrete image frames.Recently, however, a novel video sensing paradigm has emerged which eschewsvideo frames entirely. These "event" sensors aim to mimic the human visionsystem with asynchronous sensing, where each pixel has an independent, sparsedata stream. While these cameras enable high-speed and high-dynamic-rangesensing, researchers often revert to a framed representation of the event datafor existing applications, or build bespoke applications for a particularcamera's event data type. At the same time, classical video systems havesignificant computational redundancy at the application layer, since pixelsamples are repeated across frames in the uncompressed domain. To address the shortcomings of existing systems, I introduce Address,Decimation, {\Delta}t Event Representation (AD{\Delta}ER, pronounced "adder"),a novel intermediate video representation and system framework. The frameworktranscodes a variety of framed and event camera sources into a singleevent-based representation, which supports source-modeled lossy compression andbackward compatibility with traditional frame-based applications. I demonstratethat AD{\Delta}ER achieves state-of-the-art application speed and compressionperformance for scenes with high temporal redundancy. Crucially, I describe howAD{\Delta}ER unlocks an entirely new control mechanism for computer vision:application speed can correlate with both the scene content and the level oflossy compression. Finally, I discuss the implications for event-based video onlarge-scale video surveillance and resource-constrained sensing.</description><author>Andrew Freeman</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 16:00:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06248v1</guid></item><item><title>Latent Disentanglement for Low Light Image Enhancement</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06245v1</link><description>Many learning-based low-light image enhancement (LLIE) algorithms are basedon the Retinex theory.

However, these techniques oftenfall short when predicting the structures of protein complexes (PCs), whichinvolve multiple proteins. In our study, we investigate using atomic forcemicroscopy (AFM) combined with deep learning to predict the 3D structures ofPCs. AFM generates height maps that depict the PCs in various randomorientations, providing a rich information for training a neural network topredict the 3D structures. We then employ the pre-trained UpFusion model (whichutilizes a conditional diffusion model for synthesizing novel views) to trainan instance-specific NeRF model for 3D reconstruction. The performance ofUpFusion is evaluated through zero-shot predictions of 3D protein structuresusing AFM images. The challenge, however, lies in the time-intensive andimpractical nature of collecting actual AFM images. To address this, we use avirtual AFM imaging process that transforms a `PDB' protein file intomulti-view 2D virtual AFM images via volume rendering techniques. Weextensively validate the UpFusion architecture using both virtual and actualmulti-view AFM images.

In contrast, the development ofML artifacts, i.e. ML models, comes from data science and focuses on the MLmodels and their training data. However, to deliver value to end users, theseML models must be embedded in traditional software, often forming complextopologies. In fact, ML-enabled software can easily incorporate many differentML models. While the challenges and practices of building ML-enabled systemshave been studied to some extent, beyond isolated examples, little is knownabout the characteristics of real-world ML-enabled systems. Properly embeddingML models in systems so that they can be easily maintained or reused is farfrom trivial. We need to improve our empirical understanding of such systems,which we address by presenting the first large-scale study of real ML-enabledsoftware systems, covering over 2,928 open source systems on GitHub. Weclassified and analyzed them to determine their characteristics, as well astheir practices for reusing ML models and related code, and the architecture ofthese systems.

Despite its highperformance, the underlying cause and explanation remain underexplored. In thispaper, we first theoretically demonstrate that steering forget representationsin the intermediate layer reduces token confidence, causing LLMs to generatewrong or nonsense responses. Second, we investigate how the coefficientinfluences the alignment of forget-sample representations with the randomdirection and hint at the optimal coefficient values for effective unlearningacross different network layers. Third, we show that RMU unlearned models arerobust against adversarial jailbreak attacks. Last, our empirical analysisshows that RMU is less effective when applied to the middle and later layers inLLMs. To resolve this drawback, we propose Adaptive RMU -- a simple yeteffective alternative method that makes unlearning effective with most layers.Extensive experiments demonstrate that Adaptive RMU significantly improves theunlearning performance compared to prior art while incurring no additionalcomputational cost.</description><author>Dang Huu-Tien, Trung-Tin Pham, Hoang Thanh-Tung, Naoya Inoue</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 15:24:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06223v1</guid></item><item><title>A Digital Twin Framework Utilizing Machine Learning for Robust Predictive Maintenance: Enhancing Tire Health Monitoring</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06220v1</link><description>We introduce a novel digital twin framework for predictive maintenance oflong-term physical systems. Using monitoring tire health as an application, weshow how the digital twin framework can be used to enhance automotive safetyand efficiency, and how the technical challenges can be overcome using athree-step approach. Firstly, for managing the data complexity over a longoperation span, we employ data reduction techniques to concisely representphysical tires using historical performance and usage data. Relying on thesedata, for fast real-time prediction, we train a transformer-based model offlineon our concise dataset to predict future tire health over time, represented asRemaining Casing Potential (RCP). Based on our architecture, our modelquantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, providing reliableconfidence intervals around predicted RCP. Secondly, to incorporate real-timedata, we update the predictive model in the digital twin framework, ensuringits accuracy throughout its life span with the aid of hybrid modeling and theuse of discrepancy function. Thirdly, to assist decision making in predictivemaintenance, we implement a Tire State Decision Algorithm, which strategicallydetermines the optimal timing for tire replacement based on RCP forecasted byour transformer model. This approach ensures our digital twin accuratelypredicts system health, continually refines its digital representation, andsupports predictive maintenance decisions. Our framework effectively embodies aphysical system, leveraging big data and machine learning for predictivemaintenance, model updates, and decision-making.</description><author>Vispi Karkaria, Jie Chen, Christopher Luey, Chase Siuta, Damien Lim, Robert Radulescu, Wei Chen</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 15:21:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06220v1</guid></item><item><title>Detecting Android Malware: From Neural Embeddings to Hands-On Validation with BERTroid</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03620v2</link><description>As cyber threats and malware attacks increasingly alarm both individuals andbusinesses, the urgency for proactive malware countermeasures intensifies.

We propose a semisupervised historicalreconstruction task in which the model is trained on only a small amount oflabeled data (cognate sets with proto-forms) and a large amount of unlabeleddata (cognate sets without proto-forms). We propose a neural architecture forcomparative reconstruction (DPD-BiReconstructor) incorporating an essentialinsight from linguists' comparative method: that reconstructed words should notonly be reconstructable from their daughter words, but also deterministicallytransformable back into their daughter words. We show that this architecture isable to leverage unlabeled cognate sets to outperform strong semisupervisedbaselines on this novel task.</description><author>Liang Lu, Peirong Xie, David R.

We introduce DP-ZO, a private fine-tuningframework for large language models by privatizing zeroth order optimizationmethods. A key insight into the design of our method is that the direction ofthe gradient in the zeroth-order optimization we use is random and the onlyinformation from training data is the step size, i.e., a scalar. Therefore, weonly need to privatize the scalar step size, which is memory-efficient. DP-ZOprovides a strong privacy-utility trade-off across different tasks, and modelsizes that are comparable to DP-SGD in $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP. Notably,DP-ZO possesses significant advantages over DP-SGD in memory efficiency, andobtains higher utility in $\varepsilon$-DP when using the Laplace mechanism.</description><author>Xinyu Tang, Ashwinee Panda, Milad Nasr, Saeed Mahloujifar, Prateek Mittal</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 15:07:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04343v2</guid></item><item><title>Leveraging KANs For Enhanced Deep Koopman Operator Discovery</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02875v3</link><description>Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP's) have been extensively utilized in discoveringDeep Koopman operators for linearizing nonlinear dynamics.

Weextend the findings by studying computability in the deep learning frameworkfrom two perspectives: From an application viewpoint in the context ofclassification problems and a general limitation viewpoint in the context oftraining neural networks. In particular, we show restrictions on thealgorithmic solvability of classification problems that also render thealgorithmic detection of failure in computations in a general settinginfeasible. Subsequently, we prove algorithmic limitations in training deepneural networks even in cases where the underlying problem is well-behaved.Finally, we end with a positive observation, showing that in quantized versionsof classification and deep network training, computability restrictions do notarise or can be overcome to a certain degree.</description><author>Holger Boche, Vit Fojtik, Adalbert Fono, Gitta Kutyniok</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 15:02:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06212v1</guid></item><item><title>A mathematical perspective on Transformers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10794v4</link><description>Transformers play a central role in the inner workings of large languagemodels.

Besides defining the desired output image with text-prompts, anintuitive approach is to additionally use spatial guidance in form of an image,such as a depth map. In state-of-the-art approaches, this guidance is realizedby a separate controlling model that controls a pre-trained image generationnetwork, such as a latent diffusion model. Understanding this process from acontrol system perspective shows that it forms a feedback-control system, wherethe control module receives a feedback signal from the generation process andsends a corrective signal back. When analysing existing systems, we observethat the feedback signals are timely sparse and have a small number of bits. Asa consequence, there can be long delays between newly generated features andthe respective corrective signals for these features. It is known that thisdelay is the most unwanted aspect of any control system. In this work, we takean existing controlling network (ControlNet) and change the communicationbetween the controlling network and the generation process to be ofhigh-frequency and with large-bandwidth. By doing so, we are able toconsiderably improve the quality of the generated images, as well as thefidelity of the control. Also, the controlling network needs noticeably fewerparameters and hence is about twice as fast during inference and training time.Another benefit of small-sized models is that they help to democratise ourfield and are likely easier to understand. We call our proposed networkControlNet-XS. When comparing with the state-of-the-art approaches, weoutperform them for pixel-level guidance, such as depth, canny-edges, andsemantic segmentation, and are on a par for loose keypoint-guidance of humanposes.

One of the major challenges is the large search space due to a diverseset of game components. In recent works, state abstraction has been applied tosearch-based game AI and has brought significant performance improvements.State abstraction techniques rely on reducing the search space, e.g., byaggregating similar states. However, the application of these abstractions ishindered because the quality of an abstraction is difficult to evaluate.Previous works hence abandon the abstraction in the middle of the search to notbias the search to a local optimum. This mechanism introduces a hyper-parameterto decide the time to abandon the current state abstraction. In this work, wepropose a size-constrained state abstraction (SCSA), an approach that limitsthe maximum number of nodes being grouped together. We found that with SCSA,the abstraction is not required to be abandoned. Our empirical results on $3$strategy games show that the SCSA agent outperforms the previous methods andyields robust performance over different games.

Such models typically require first coming up with a set ofconcepts relevant to the task and then aligning the representations of afeature extractor to map to these concepts. However, even with powerfulfoundational feature extractors like CLIP, there are no guarantees that thespecified concepts are detectable. In this work, we leverage recent advances inmechanistic interpretability and propose a novel CBM approach -- calledDiscover-then-Name-CBM (DN-CBM) -- that inverts the typical paradigm: insteadof pre-selecting concepts based on the downstream classification task, we usesparse autoencoders to first discover concepts learnt by the model, and thenname them and train linear probes for classification. Our concept extractionstrategy is efficient, since it is agnostic to the downstream task, and usesconcepts already known to the model. We perform a comprehensive evaluationacross multiple datasets and CLIP architectures and show that our method yieldssemantically meaningful concepts, assigns appropriate names to them that makethem easy to interpret, and yields performant and interpretable CBMs. Codeavailable at https://github.com/neuroexplicit-saar/discover-then-name.</description><author>Sukrut Rao, Sweta Mahajan, Moritz Böhle, Bernt Schiele</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 14:50:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14499v2</guid></item><item><title>Dynamic Blocked Clause Elimination for Projected Model Counting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06199v1</link><description>In this paper, we explore the application of blocked clause elimination forprojected model counting.

Preference learning, which trains models to distinguishbetween preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, hasbecome a crucial component for ensuring that LLMs align with human values.Despite the widespread adoption in real-world systems, a thorough theoreticalunderstanding of the generalization guarantees for these models remain lacking.This paper bridges that gap by introducing a new theoretical framework toanalyze the generalization guarantees of models trained with direct preferenceoptimization (DPO). While existing generalization theory often focuses onoverparameterized models achieving near-optimal loss or models independent ofthe training process, our framework rigorously assesses how well modelsgeneralize after a finite number of gradient steps, reflecting real-world LLMtraining practices. By analyzing the reward margin associated with each sampleand its trajectory throughout training, we can effectively bound thegeneralization error. We derive learning guarantees showing that, underspecific conditions, models trained with DPO can correctly discern preferredresponses on unseen data with high probability. These insights are empiricallyvalidated on contemporary LLMs, underscoring the practical relevance of ourtheoretical findings.</description><author>Shawn Im, Yixuan Li</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 14:45:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03459v2</guid></item><item><title>A secure and private ensemble matcher using multi-vault obfuscated templates</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05205v2</link><description>Generative AI has revolutionized modern machine learning by providingunprecedented realism, diversity, and efficiency in data generation. Thistechnology holds immense potential for biometrics, including for securingsensitive and personally identifiable information. Given the irrevocability ofbiometric samples and mounting privacy concerns, biometric template securityand secure matching are among the most sought-after features of modernbiometric systems. This paper proposes a novel obfuscation method usingGenerative AI to enhance biometric template security. Our approach utilizessynthetic facial images generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) as"random chaff points" within a secure vault system. Our method creates nsub-templates from the original template, each obfuscated with m GAN chaffpoints. During verification, s closest vectors to the biometric query areretrieved from each vault and combined to generate hash values, which are thencompared with the stored hash value. Thus, our method safeguards useridentities during the training and deployment phases by employing theGAN-generated synthetic images. Our protocol was tested using the AT&amp;T, GT, andLFW face datasets, achieving ROC areas under the curve of 0.99, 0.99, and 0.90,respectively. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can maintainhigh accuracy and reasonable computational complexity comparable to thoseunprotected template methods while significantly enhancing security andprivacy, underscoring the potential of Generative AI in developing proactivedefensive strategies for biometric systems.</description><author>Babak Poorebrahim Gilkalaye, Shubhabrata Mukherjee, Reza Derakhshani</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 14:42:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05205v2</guid></item><item><title>Mutual Reasoning Makes Smaller LLMs Stronger Problem-Solvers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06195v1</link><description>This paper introduces rStar, a self-play mutual reasoning approach thatsignificantly improves reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs)without fine-tuning or superior models. rStar decouples reasoning into aself-play mutual generation-discrimination process.

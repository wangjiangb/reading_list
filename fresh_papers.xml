While current learning-based depth estimation models trainand test on meticulously curated data, they often overlook out-of-distribution(OoD) situations. Yet, in practical settings -- especially safety-critical oneslike autonomous driving -- common corruptions can arise. Addressing thisoversight, we introduce a comprehensive robustness test suite, RoboDepth,encompassing 18 corruptions spanning three categories: i) weather and lightingconditions; ii) sensor failures and movement; and iii) data processinganomalies. We subsequently benchmark 42 depth estimation models across indoorand outdoor scenes to assess their resilience to these corruptions. Ourfindings underscore that, in the absence of a dedicated robustness evaluationframework, many leading depth estimation models may be susceptible to typicalcorruptions. We delve into design considerations for crafting more robust depthestimation models, touching upon pre-training, augmentation, modality, modelcapacity, and learning paradigms. We anticipate our benchmark will establish afoundational platform for advancing robust OoD depth estimation.</description><author>Lingdong Kong, Shaoyuan Xie, Hanjiang Hu, Lai Xing Ng, Benoit R.

However, existing video generation models are typically trained on alimited number of frames, resulting in the inability to generate high-fidelitylong videos during inference. Furthermore, these models only supportsingle-text conditions, whereas real-life scenarios often require multi-textconditions as the video content changes over time. To tackle these challenges,this study explores the potential of extending the text-driven capability togenerate longer videos conditioned on multiple texts. 1) We first analyze theimpact of initial noise in video diffusion models. Then building upon theobservation of noise, we propose FreeNoise, a tuning-free and time-efficientparadigm to enhance the generative capabilities of pretrained video diffusionmodels while preserving content consistency. Specifically, instead ofinitializing noises for all frames, we reschedule a sequence of noises forlong-range correlation and perform temporal attention over them by window-basedfunction. 2) Additionally, we design a novel motion injection method to supportthe generation of videos conditioned on multiple text prompts. Extensiveexperiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending thegenerative capabilities of video diffusion models. It is noteworthy thatcompared with the previous best-performing method which brought about 255%extra time cost, our method incurs only negligible time cost of approximately17%.

For this, meshes areappealing since they 1) enable fast physics-based rendering with realisticmaterial and lighting, 2) support physical simulation, and 3) arememory-efficient for modern graphics pipelines. Recent work on reconstructingand statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as beingtopologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3Drepresentation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin,open, surfaces. Recent work has focused on the former, and methods forreconstructing open surfaces do not support fast reconstruction with materialand lighting or unconditional generative modelling. Inspired by the observationthat open surfaces can be seen as islands floating on watertight surfaces, weparameterize open surfaces by defining a manifold signed distance field onwatertight templates. With this parameterization, we further develop agrid-based and differentiable representation that parameterizes both watertightand non-watertight meshes of arbitrary topology. Our new representation, calledGhost-on-the-Shell (G-Shell), enables two important applications:differentiable rasterization-based reconstruction from multiview images andgenerative modelling of non-watertight meshes. We empirically demonstrate thatG-Shell achieves state-of-the-art performance on non-watertight meshreconstruction and generation tasks, while also performing effectively forwatertight meshes.</description><author>Zhen Liu, Yao Feng, Yuliang Xiu, Weiyang Liu, Liam Paull, Michael J.

Recently, multiple vision-language models (VLMs) have been proposedwith excellent commonsense reasoning ability in various domains. However, howto harness the collective power of these complementary VLMs is rarely explored.Existing methods like ensemble still struggle to aggregate these models withthe desired higher-order communications. In this work, we propose Cola, a novelparadigm that coordinates multiple VLMs for visual reasoning. Our key insightis that a large language model (LLM) can efficiently coordinate multiple VLMsby facilitating natural language communication that leverages their distinctand complementary capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ourinstruction tuning variant, Cola-FT, achieves state-of-the-art performance onvisual question answering (VQA), outside knowledge VQA, visual entailment, andvisual spatial reasoning tasks. Moreover, we show that our in-context learningvariant, Cola-Zero, exhibits competitive performance in zero and few-shotsettings, without finetuning. Through systematic ablation studies andvisualizations, we validate that a coordinator LLM indeed comprehends theinstruction prompts as well as the separate functionalities of VLMs; it thencoordinates them to enable impressive visual reasoning capabilities.</description><author>Liangyu Chen, Bo Li, Sheng Shen, Jingkang Yang, Chunyuan Li, Kurt Keutzer, Trevor Darrell, Ziwei Liu</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:59:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15166v1</guid></item><item><title>Handling Data Heterogeneity via Architectural Design for Federated Visual Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15165v1</link><description>Federated Learning (FL) is a promising research paradigm that enables thecollaborative training of machine learning models among various parties withoutthe need for sensitive information exchange. Nonetheless, retaining data inindividual clients introduces fundamental challenges to achieving performanceon par with centrally trained models. Our study provides an extensive review offederated learning applied to visual recognition. It underscores the criticalrole of thoughtful architectural design choices in achieving optimalperformance, a factor often neglected in the FL literature. Many existing FLsolutions are tested on shallow or simple networks, which may not accuratelyreflect real-world applications. This practice restricts the transferability ofresearch findings to large-scale visual recognition models. Through an in-depthanalysis of diverse cutting-edge architectures such as convolutional neuralnetworks, transformers, and MLP-mixers, we experimentally demonstrate thatarchitectural choices can substantially enhance FL systems' performance,particularly when handling heterogeneous data. We study 19 visual recognitionmodels from five different architectural families on four challenging FLdatasets. We also re-investigate the inferior performance of convolution-basedarchitectures in the FL setting and analyze the influence of normalizationlayers on the FL performance. Our findings emphasize the importance ofarchitectural design for computer vision tasks in practical scenarios,effectively narrowing the performance gap between federated and centralizedlearning.

In this work,we investigate the validity of instead reformulating such tasks as modularneurosymbolic programming, which we call LINC: Logical Inference viaNeurosymbolic Computation. In LINC, the LLM acts as a semantic parser,translating premises and conclusions from natural language to expressions infirst-order logic. These expressions are then offloaded to an external theoremprover, which symbolically performs deductive inference. Leveraging thisapproach, we observe significant performance gains on FOLIO and a balancedsubset of ProofWriter for three different models in nearly all experimentalconditions we evaluate. On ProofWriter, augmenting the comparatively smallopen-source StarCoder+ (15.5B parameters) with LINC even outperforms GPT-3.5and GPT-4 with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting by an absolute 38% and 10%,respectively. When used with GPT-4, LINC scores 26% higher than CoT onProofWriter while performing comparatively on FOLIO. Further analysis revealsthat although both methods on average succeed roughly equally often on thisdataset, they exhibit distinct and complementary failure modes. We thus providepromising evidence for how logical reasoning over natural language can betackled through jointly leveraging LLMs alongside symbolic provers.

These issues can hardly be addressed byfine-tuning SAM on medical data because the original 2D structure of SAMneglects 3D spatial information. In this paper, we introduce SAM-Med3D, themost comprehensive study to modify SAM for 3D medical images. Our approach ischaracterized by its comprehensiveness in two primary aspects: firstly, bycomprehensively reformulating SAM to a thorough 3D architecture trained on acomprehensively processed large-scale volumetric medical dataset; and secondly,by providing a comprehensive evaluation of its performance. Specifically, wetrain SAM-Med3D with over 131K 3D masks and 247 categories. Our SAM-Med3Dexcels at capturing 3D spatial information, exhibiting competitive performancewith significantly fewer prompt points than the top-performing fine-tuned SAMin the medical domain. We then evaluate its capabilities across 15 datasets andanalyze it from multiple perspectives, including anatomical structures,modalities, targets, and generalization abilities. Our approach, compared withSAM, showcases pronouncedly enhanced efficiency and broad segmentationcapabilities for 3D volumetric medical images.

However, they are extremely hungryfor delicate annotations to train, and the acquisition is laborious andunaffordable. Therefore, we present FreeMask in this work, which resorts tosynthetic images from generative models to ease the burden of both datacollection and annotation procedures. Concretely, we first synthesize abundanttraining images conditioned on the semantic masks provided by realisticdatasets. This yields extra well-aligned image-mask training pairs for semanticsegmentation models. We surprisingly observe that, solely trained withsynthetic images, we already achieve comparable performance with real ones(e.g., 48.3 vs. 48.5 mIoU on ADE20K, and 49.3 vs. 50.5 on COCO-Stuff). Then, weinvestigate the role of synthetic images by joint training with real images, orpre-training for real images. Meantime, we design a robust filtering principleto suppress incorrectly synthesized regions. In addition, we propose toinequally treat different semantic masks to prioritize those harder ones andsample more corresponding synthetic images for them. As a result, eitherjointly trained or pre-trained with our filtered and re-sampled synthesizedimages, segmentation models can be greatly enhanced, e.g., from 48.7 to 52.0 onADE20K.

Inthis study, we reveal that across a range of models, sentiment is representedlinearly: a single direction in activation space mostly captures the featureacross a range of tasks with one extreme for positive and the other fornegative. Through causal interventions, we isolate this direction and show itis causally relevant in both toy tasks and real world datasets such as StanfordSentiment Treebank. Through this case study we model a thorough investigationof what a single direction means on a broad data distribution. We further uncover the mechanisms that involve this direction, highlightingthe roles of a small subset of attention heads and neurons. Finally, wediscover a phenomenon which we term the summarization motif: sentiment is notsolely represented on emotionally charged words, but is additionally summarizedat intermediate positions without inherent sentiment, such as punctuation andnames. We show that in Stanford Sentiment Treebank zero-shot classification,76% of above-chance classification accuracy is lost when ablating the sentimentdirection, nearly half of which (36%) is due to ablating the summarizedsentiment direction exclusively at comma positions.</description><author>Curt Tigges, Oskar John Hollinsworth, Atticus Geiger, Neel Nanda</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:55:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15154v1</guid></item><item><title>Verb Conjugation in Transformers Is Determined by Linear Encodings of Subject Number</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15151v1</link><description>Deep architectures such as Transformers are sometimes criticized for havinguninterpretable "black-box" representations. We use causal interventionanalysis to show that, in fact, some linguistic features are represented in alinear, interpretable format. Specifically, we show that BERT's ability toconjugate verbs relies on a linear encoding of subject number that can bemanipulated with predictable effects on conjugation accuracy. This encoding isfound in the subject position at the first layer and the verb position at thelast layer, but distributed across positions at middle layers, particularlywhen there are multiple cues to subject number.</description><author>Sophie Hao, Tal Linzen</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:53:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15151v1</guid></item><item><title>Online Detection of AI-Generated Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15150v1</link><description>With advancements in AI-generated images coming on a continuous basis, it isincreasingly difficult to distinguish traditionally-sourced images (e.g.,photos, artwork) from AI-generated ones. Previous detection methods study thegeneralization from a single generator to another in isolation. However, inreality, new generators are released on a streaming basis. We studygeneralization in this setting, training on N models and testing on the next(N+k), following the historical release dates of well-known generation methods.Furthermore, images increasingly consist of both real and generated components,for example through image inpainting. Thus, we extend this approach to pixelprediction, demonstrating strong performance using automatically-generatedinpainted data.

However, such a paradigm becomesparticularly challenging with tabular data when there are discrepancies betweenthe feature sets of pre-trained models and the target tasks. In this paper, wepropose TabToken, a method aims at enhancing the quality of feature tokens(i.e., embeddings of tabular features). TabToken allows for the utilization ofpre-trained models when the upstream and downstream tasks share overlappingfeatures, facilitating model fine-tuning even with limited training examples.Specifically, we introduce a contrastive objective that regularizes the tokens,capturing the semantics within and across features. During the pre-trainingstage, the tokens are learned jointly with top-layer deep models such astransformer. In the downstream task, tokens of the shared features are keptfixed while TabToken efficiently fine-tunes the remaining parts of the model.TabToken not only enables knowledge transfer from a pre-trained model to taskswith heterogeneous features, but also enhances the discriminative ability ofdeep tabular models in standard classification and regression tasks.</description><author>Qi-Le Zhou, Han-Jia Ye, Le-Ye Wang, De-Chuan Zhan</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:53:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15149v1</guid></item><item><title>S3Eval: A Synthetic, Scalable, Systematic Evaluation Suite for Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15147v1</link><description>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to greatstrides in model capabilities like reasoning and long-context understanding.However, as LLMs are able to process longer contexts, it becomes morechallenging to evaluate whether they have acquired certain capabilities, sincethe length of text (e.g., 100K tokens) they can process far exceeds what humanscan reliably assess in a reasonable duration. In this paper, we propose usingcomplex synthetic tasks as a proxy evaluation method, and present S3Eval, aSynthetic, Scalable, Systematic evaluation suite for LLMs evaluation. As asynthetic benchmark, S3Eval enables the creation of any number of evaluationexamples that are theoretically invisible to LLMs, mitigating the test setcontamination issue. The synthetic nature of S3Eval provides users full controlover the dataset, allowing them to systematically probe LLM capabilities byscaling text length and varying task difficulty across diverse scenarios. Thestrong correlation between S3Eval performance and scores of real-worldbenchmarks like Big-Bench Hard (BBH) demonstrates the soundness of using S3Evalfor evaluation of LLMs. The in-depth analysis also uncover additional insights,including performance drop when the answer is sparsely distributed or locatedin the middle context, as well as some counter-intuitive trends of modelperformance.</description><author>Fangyu Lei, Qian Liu, Yiming Huang, Shizhu He, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:52:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15147v1</guid></item><item><title>GRASP: Accelerating Shortest Path Attacks via Graph Attention</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07980v2</link><description>Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in aiding andaccelerating classical combinatorial optimization algorithms. ML-based speedups that aim to learn in an end to end manner (i.e., directly output thesolution) tend to trade off run time with solution quality. Therefore,solutions that are able to accelerate existing solvers while maintaining theirperformance guarantees, are of great interest. We consider an APX-hard problem,where an adversary aims to attack shortest paths in a graph by removing theminimum number of edges. We propose the GRASP algorithm: Graph AttentionAccelerated Shortest Path Attack, an ML aided optimization algorithm thatachieves run times up to 10x faster, while maintaining the quality of solutiongenerated. GRASP uses a graph attention network to identify a smaller subgraphcontaining the combinatorial solution, thus effectively reducing the inputproblem size. Additionally, we demonstrate how careful representation of theinput graph, including node features that correlate well with the optimizationtask, can highlight important structure in the optimization solution.</description><author>Zohair Shafi, Benjamin A.

We aim to enable this paradigm in robotic reinforcement learning,allowing a robot to learn a new task with little human effort by leveragingdata and models from the Internet. However, reinforcement learning oftenrequires significant human effort in the form of manual reward specification orenvironment resets, even if the policy is pre-trained. We introduce RoboFuME, areset-free fine-tuning system that pre-trains a multi-task manipulation policyfrom diverse datasets of prior experiences and self-improves online to learn atarget task with minimal human intervention.

Recent T2I models like DALL-E 3 and others, havedemonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating photorealistic images thatalign closely with textual inputs. While the allure of creating visuallycaptivating images is undeniable, our emphasis extends beyond mere aestheticpleasure. We aim to investigate the potential of using these powerful models inauthentic design contexts. In pursuit of this goal, we develop DEsignBench,which incorporates test samples designed to assess T2I models on both "designtechnical capability" and "design application scenario." Each of these twodimensions is supported by a diverse set of specific design categories. Weexplore DALL-E 3 together with other leading T2I models on DEsignBench,resulting in a comprehensive visual gallery for side-by-side comparisons.

This problem is tackled by ANNCUR (Yadav et al., 2022), a recentwork that employs a cross-encoder only, making search efficient using arelatively small number of anchor items, and a CUR matrix factorization. WhileANNCUR's one-time selection of anchors tends to approximate the cross-encoderdistances on average, doing so forfeits the capacity to accurately estimatedistances to items near the query, leading to regret in the crucial end-task:recall of top-k items. In this paper, we propose ADACUR, a method thatadaptively, iteratively, and efficiently minimizes the approximation error forthe practically important top-k neighbors. It does so by iteratively performingk-NN search using the anchors available so far, then adding these retrievednearest neighbors to the anchor set for the next round. Empirically, onmultiple datasets, in comparison to previous traditional and state-of-the-artmethods such as ANNCUR and dual-encoder-based retrieve-and-rerank, our proposedapproach ADACUR consistently reduces recall error-by up to 70% on the importantk = 1 setting-while using no more compute than its competitors.</description><author>Nishant Yadav, Nicholas Monath, Manzil Zaheer, Andrew McCallum</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:48:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02996v2</guid></item><item><title>Hyperparameter optimization of hp-greedy reduced basis for gravitational wave surrogates</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15143v1</link><description>In a previous work we introduced, in the context of gravitational wavescience, an initial study on an automated domain-decomposition approach forreduced basis through hp-greedy refinement. The approach constructs localreduced bases of lower dimensionality than global ones, with the same or higheraccuracy. These ``light'' local bases should imply both faster evaluations whenpredicting new waveforms and faster data analysis, in particular fasterstatistical inference (the forward and inverse problems, respectively). In thisapproach, however, we have previously found important dependence on severalhyperparameters, which do not appear in global reduced basis. This naturallyleads to the problem of hyperparameter optimization (HPO), which is the subjectof this paper. We tackle the problem through a Bayesian optimization, and showits superiority when compared to grid or random searches. We find that forgravitational waves from the collision of two spinning but non-precessing blackholes, for the same accuracy, local hp-greedy reduced bases with HPO have alower dimensionality of up to $4 \times$ for the cases here studied, dependingon the desired accuracy. This factor should directly translate in a parameterestimation speedup, for instance. Such acceleration might help in the nearreal-time requirements for electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wavesfrom compact binary coalescences. In addition, we find that the Bayesianapproach used in this paper for HPO is two orders of magnitude faster than, forexample, a grid search, with about a $100 \times$ acceleration.

Their influence is particularly pronouncedin pivotal sectors like healthcare, where lay individuals are increasinglyappropriating LLMs as conversational agents for everyday queries. While LLMsdemonstrate impressive language understanding and generation proficiencies,concerns regarding their safety remain paramount in these high-stake domains.Moreover, the development of LLMs is disproportionately focused on English. Itremains unclear how these LLMs perform in the context of non-English languages,a gap that is critical for ensuring equity in the real-world use of thesesystems.This paper provides a framework to investigate the effectiveness ofLLMs as multi-lingual dialogue systems for healthcare queries. Ourempirically-derived framework XlingEval focuses on three fundamental criteriafor evaluating LLM responses to naturalistic human-authored health-relatedquestions: correctness, consistency, and verifiability. Through extensiveexperiments on four major global languages, including English, Spanish,Chinese, and Hindi, spanning three expert-annotated large health Q&amp;A datasets,and through an amalgamation of algorithmic and human-evaluation strategies, wefound a pronounced disparity in LLM responses across these languages,indicating a need for enhanced cross-lingual capabilities. We further proposeXlingHealth, a cross-lingual benchmark for examining the multilingualcapabilities of LLMs in the healthcare context.

However,autoregressive sampling generates tokens one at a time making it slow, and evenprohibitive in certain tasks. One way to speed up sampling is$\textit{speculative decoding}$: use a small model to sample a $\textit{draft}$(block or sequence of tokens), and then score all tokens in the draft by thelarge language model in parallel. A subset of the tokens in the draft areaccepted (and the rest rejected) based on a statistical method to guaranteethat the final output follows the distribution of the large model. In thiswork, we provide a principled understanding of speculative decoding through thelens of optimal transport (OT) with $\textit{membership cost}$. This frameworkcan be viewed as an extension of the well-known $\textit{maximal-coupling}$problem. This new formulation enables us to generalize the speculative decodingmethod to allow for a set of $k$ candidates at the token-level, which leads toan improved optimal membership cost. We show that the optimal draft selectionalgorithm (transport plan) can be computed via linear programming, whosebest-known runtime is exponential in $k$. We then propose a valid draftselection algorithm whose acceptance probability is $(1-1/e)$-optimalmultiplicatively. Moreover, it can be computed in time almost linear with sizeof domain of a single token. Using this $new draft selection$ algorithm, wedevelop a new autoregressive sampling algorithm called $\textit{SpecTr}$, whichprovides speedup in decoding while ensuring that there is no qualitydegradation in the decoded output. We experimentally demonstrate that forstate-of-the-art large language models, the proposed approach achieves a wallclock speedup of 2.13X, a further 1.37X speedup over speculative decoding onstandard benchmarks.</description><author>Ziteng Sun, Ananda Theertha Suresh, Jae Hun Ro, Ahmad Beirami, Himanshu Jain, Felix Yu</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:47:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15141v1</guid></item><item><title>AutoDAN: Automatic and Interpretable Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15140v1</link><description>Safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be compromised withmanual jailbreak attacks and (automatic) adversarial attacks. Recent worksuggests that patching LLMs against these attacks is possible: manual jailbreakattacks are human-readable but often limited and public, making them easy toblock; adversarial attacks generate gibberish prompts that can be detectedusing perplexity-based filters. In this paper, we show that these solutions maybe too optimistic. We propose an interpretable adversarial attack,\texttt{AutoDAN}, that combines the strengths of both types of attacks. Itautomatically generates attack prompts that bypass perplexity-based filterswhile maintaining a high attack success rate like manual jailbreak attacks.These prompts are interpretable and diverse, exhibiting strategies commonlyused in manual jailbreak attacks, and transfer better than their non-readablecounterparts when using limited training data or a single proxy model. We alsocustomize \texttt{AutoDAN}'s objective to leak system prompts, anotherjailbreak application not addressed in the adversarial attack literature. %,demonstrating the versatility of the approach. We can also customize theobjective of \texttt{AutoDAN} to leak system prompts, beyond the ability toelicit harmful content from the model, demonstrating the versatility of theapproach.

Toperform a task, recent works often require a model to learn from trace examplesof the task via either supervised learning or few/many-shot prompting. Withoutthese trace examples, it remains a challenge how an agent can autonomouslylearn and improve its control on a computer, which limits the ability of anagent to perform a new task. We approach this problem with a zero-shot agentthat requires no given expert traces. Our agent plans for executable actions ona partially observed environment, and iteratively progresses a task byidentifying and learning from its mistakes via self-reflection and structuredthought management. On the easy tasks of MiniWoB++, we show that our zero-shotagent often outperforms recent SoTAs, with more efficient reasoning. For taskswith more complexity, our reflective agent performs on par with prior bestmodels, even though previous works had the advantages of accessing experttraces or additional screen information.</description><author>Tao Li, Gang Li, Zhiwei Deng, Bryan Wang, Yang Li</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:39:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08740v3</guid></item><item><title>Novel-View Acoustic Synthesis from 3D Reconstructed Rooms</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15130v1</link><description>We investigate the benefit of combining blind audio recordings with 3D sceneinformation for novel-view acoustic synthesis.

BNNs reduce the computational requirements andenergy consumption of deep learning models with minimal loss in accuracy.However, training them in practice remains to be an open challenge. Most knownBNN-optimisers either rely on projected updates or binarise weightspost-training. Instead, QP-SBGD approximately maps the gradient onto binaryvariables, by solving a quadratic constrained binary optimisation. Underpractically reasonable assumptions, we show that this update rule convergeswith a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1 / \sqrt{T})$. Moreover, we show how the$\mathcal{NP}$-hard projection can be effectively executed on an adiabaticquantum annealer, harnessing recent advancements in quantum computation. Wealso introduce a projected version of this update rule and prove that if afixed point exists in the binary variable space, the modified updates willconverge to it. Last but not least, our algorithm is implemented layer-wise,making it suitable to train larger networks on resource-limited quantumhardware.

In the context of engineering design, GSA hasbeen widely used to understand both individual and collective contributions ofdesign variables on the design objectives. So far, global sensitivity studieshave often been limited to design spaces with only quantitative (numerical)design variables. However, many engineering systems also contain, if not only,qualitative (categorical) design variables in addition to quantitative designvariables. In this paper, we integrate Latent Variable Gaussian Process (LVGP)with Sobol' analysis to develop the first metamodel-based mixed-variable GSAmethod. Through numerical case studies, we validate and demonstrate theeffectiveness of our proposed method for mixed-variable problems. Furthermore,while the proposed GSA method is general enough to benefit various engineeringdesign applications, we integrate it with multi-objective Bayesian optimization(BO) to create a sensitivity-aware design framework in accelerating the Paretofront design exploration for metal-organic framework (MOF) materials withmany-level combinatorial design spaces. Although MOFs are constructed only fromqualitative variables that are notoriously difficult to design, our method canutilize sensitivity analysis to navigate the optimization in the many-levellarge combinatorial design space, greatly expediting the exploration of novelMOF candidates.</description><author>Yigitcan Comlek, Liwei Wang, Wei Chen</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:29:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15124v1</guid></item><item><title>Branch-Solve-Merge Improves Large Language Model Evaluation and Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15123v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently used for multi-faceted languagegeneration and evaluation tasks that involve satisfying intricate userconstraints or taking into account multiple aspects and criteria. However,their performance can fall short, due to the model's lack of coherence andinability to plan and decompose the problem. We propose Branch-Solve-Merge(BSM), a Large Language Model program (Schlag et al., 2023) for tackling suchchallenging natural language tasks. It consists of branch, solve, and mergemodules that are parameterized with specific prompts to the base LLM. Thesethree modules plan a decomposition of the task into multiple parallelsub-tasks, independently solve them, and fuse the solutions to the sub-tasks.We apply our method to the tasks of LLM response evaluation and constrainedtext generation and evaluate its effectiveness with multiple LLMs, includingVicuna, LLaMA-2-chat, and GPT-4. BSM improves the evaluation correctness andconsistency for each LLM by enhancing human-LLM agreement by up to 26%,reducing length and pairwise position biases by up to 50%, and allowingLLaMA-2-chat to match or outperform GPT-4 on most domains.

Since the well-known backdoorcriterion depends on the graph, any errors in the graph can propagatedownstream to effect inference. In this work, we initially show that completegraph information is not necessary for causal effect inference; the topologicalorder over graph variables (causal order) alone suffices. Further, given a nodepair, causal order is easier to elicit from domain experts compared to graphedges since determining the existence of an edge can depend extensively onother variables. Interestingly, we find that the same principle holds for LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, motivating an automatedmethod to obtain causal order (and hence causal effect) with LLMs acting asvirtual domain experts. To this end, we employ different prompting strategiesand contextual cues to propose a robust technique of obtaining causal orderfrom LLMs. Acknowledging LLMs' limitations, we also study possible techniquesto integrate LLMs with established causal discovery algorithms, includingconstraint-based and score-based methods, to enhance their performance.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improvescausal ordering accuracy as compared to discovery algorithms, highlighting thepotential of LLMs to enhance causal inference across diverse fields.</description><author>Aniket Vashishtha, Abbavaram Gowtham Reddy, Abhinav Kumar, Saketh Bachu, Vineeth N Balasubramanian, Amit Sharma</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:23:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15117v1</guid></item><item><title>SpVOS: Efficient Video Object Segmentation with Triple Sparse Convolution</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15115v1</link><description>Semi-supervised video object segmentation (Semi-VOS), which requires onlyannotating the first frame of a video to segment future frames, has receivedincreased attention recently. Among existing pipelines, thememory-matching-based one is becoming the main research stream, as it can fullyutilize the temporal sequence information to obtain high-quality segmentationresults. Even though this type of method has achieved promising performance,the overall framework still suffers from heavy computation overhead, mainlycaused by the per-frame dense convolution operations between high-resolutionfeature maps and each kernel filter. Therefore, we propose a sparse baseline ofVOS named SpVOS in this work, which develops a novel triple sparse convolutionto reduce the computation costs of the overall VOS framework. The designedtriple gate, taking full consideration of both spatial and temporal redundancybetween adjacent video frames, adaptively makes a triple decision to decide howto apply the sparse convolution on each pixel to control the computationoverhead of each layer, while maintaining sufficient discrimination capabilityto distinguish similar objects and avoid error accumulation. A mixed sparsetraining strategy, coupled with a designed objective considering the sparsityconstraint, is also developed to balance the VOS segmentation performance andcomputation costs. Experiments are conducted on two mainstream VOS datasets,including DAVIS and Youtube-VOS. Results show that, the proposed SpVOS achievessuperior performance over other state-of-the-art sparse methods, and evenmaintains comparable performance, e.g., an 83.04% (79.29%) overall score on theDAVIS-2017 (Youtube-VOS) validation set, with the typical non-sparse VOSbaseline (82.88% for DAVIS-2017 and 80.36% for Youtube-VOS) while saving up to42% FLOPs, showing its application potential for resource-constrainedscenarios.</description><author>Weihao Lin, Tao Chen, Chong Yu</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:21:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15115v1</guid></item><item><title>How To Build Competitive Multi-gender Speech Translation Models For Controlling Speaker Gender Translation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15114v1</link><description>When translating from notional gender languages (e.g., English) intogrammatical gender languages (e.g., Italian), the generated translationrequires explicit gender assignments for various words, including thosereferring to the speaker. When the source sentence does not convey thespeaker's gender, speech translation (ST) models either rely on thepossibly-misleading vocal traits of the speaker or default to the masculinegender, the most frequent in existing training corpora. To avoid such biasedand not inclusive behaviors, the gender assignment of speaker-relatedexpressions should be guided by externally-provided metadata about thespeaker's gender. While previous work has shown that the most effectivesolution is represented by separate, dedicated gender-specific models, the goalof this paper is to achieve the same results by integrating the speaker'sgender metadata into a single "multi-gender" neural ST model, easier tomaintain. Our experiments demonstrate that a single multi-gender modeloutperforms gender-specialized ones when trained from scratch (with genderaccuracy gains up to 12.9 for feminine forms), while fine-tuning from existingST models does not lead to competitive results.</description><author>Marco Gaido, Dennis Fucci, Matteo Negri, Luisa Bentivogli</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:21:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15114v1</guid></item><item><title>Counting the Bugs in ChatGPT's Wugs: A Multilingual Investigation into the Morphological Capabilities of a Large Language Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15113v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have recently reached an impressive level oflinguistic capability, prompting comparisons with human language skills.However, there have been relatively few systematic inquiries into thelinguistic capabilities of the latest generation of LLMs, and those studiesthat do exist (i) ignore the remarkable ability of humans to generalize, (ii)focus only on English, and (iii) investigate syntax or semantics and overlookother capabilities that lie at the heart of human language, like morphology.Here, we close these gaps by conducting the first rigorous analysis of themorphological capabilities of ChatGPT in four typologically varied languages(specifically, English, German, Tamil, and Turkish).

Existing methods often resort totraining cascaded models in pixel space or using a downsampled latent space ofa separately trained auto-encoder. In this paper, we introduce MatryoshkaDiffusion Models(MDM), an end-to-end framework for high-resolution image andvideo synthesis. We propose a diffusion process that denoises inputs atmultiple resolutions jointly and uses a NestedUNet architecture where featuresand parameters for small-scale inputs are nested within those of large scales.In addition, MDM enables a progressive training schedule from lower to higherresolutions, which leads to significant improvements in optimization forhigh-resolution generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach onvarious benchmarks, including class-conditioned image generation,high-resolution text-to-image, and text-to-video applications. Remarkably, wecan train a single pixel-space model at resolutions of up to 1024x1024 pixels,demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization using the CC12M dataset, whichcontains only 12 million images.</description><author>Jiatao Gu, Shuangfei Zhai, Yizhe Zhang, Josh Susskind, Navdeep Jaitly</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:20:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15111v1</guid></item><item><title>Zero123++: a Single Image to Consistent Multi-view Diffusion Base Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15110v1</link><description>We report Zero123++, an image-conditioned diffusion model for generating3D-consistent multi-view images from a single input view.

Evaluating Persona Biases in Dialogue Systems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05280v4</link><description>Recent advancements in Large Language Models empower them to follow freeforminstructions, including imitating generic or specific demographic personas inconversations. We define generic personas to represent demographic groups, suchas "an Asian person", whereas specific personas may take the form of specificpopular Asian names like "Yumi". While the adoption of personas enriches userexperiences by making dialogue systems more engaging and approachable, it alsocasts a shadow of potential risk by exacerbating social biases within modelresponses, thereby causing societal harm through interactions with users. Inthis paper, we systematically study "persona biases", which we define to be thesensitivity of dialogue models' harmful behaviors contingent upon the personasthey adopt. We categorize persona biases into biases in harmful expression andharmful agreement, and establish a comprehensive evaluation framework tomeasure persona biases in five aspects: Offensiveness, Toxic Continuation,Regard, Stereotype Agreement, and Toxic Agreement. Additionally, we propose toinvestigate persona biases by experimenting with UNIVERSALPERSONA, asystematically constructed persona dataset encompassing various types of bothgeneric and specific model personas. Through benchmarking on four differentmodels -- including Blender, ChatGPT, Alpaca, and Vicuna -- our study uncoverssignificant persona biases in dialogue systems. Our findings also underscorethe pressing need to revisit the use of personas in dialogue agents to ensuresafe application.</description><author>Yixin Wan, Jieyu Zhao, Aman Chadha, Nanyun Peng, Kai-Wei Chang</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:18:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05280v4</guid></item><item><title>GRENADE: Graph-Centric Language Model for Self-Supervised Representation Learning on Text-Attributed Graphs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15109v1</link><description>Self-supervised representation learning on text-attributed graphs, which aimsto create expressive and generalizable representations for various downstreamtasks, has received increasing research attention lately.

To solve the problem ofself-supervised representation learning on text-attributed graphs, we develop anovel Graph-Centric Language model -- GRENADE. Specifically, GRENADE exploitsthe synergistic effect of both pre-trained language model and graph neuralnetwork by optimizing with two specialized self-supervised learning algorithms:graph-centric contrastive learning and graph-centric knowledge alignment. Theproposed graph-centric self-supervised learning algorithms effectively helpGRENADE to capture informative textual semantics as well as structural contextinformation on text-attributed graphs.

However, thiswork argues that the leading cause of DMs not achieving maximum performanceresides in the quality of the datasets rather than the models employed thusfar; this means that dataset errors, like mislabeling, originate a largepercentage of failures in dialogue management. We studied the main errors inthe most widely used datasets, Multiwoz 2.1 and SGD, to demonstrate thishypothesis.

However,in non-standard settings, particularly those where observations are notindependently and identically distributed, resampling using simple random datadivisions may lead to biased GE estimates. This paper strives to presentwell-grounded guidelines for GE estimation in various such non-standardsettings: clustered data, spatial data, unequal sampling probabilities, conceptdrift, and hierarchically structured outcomes. Our overview combineswell-established methodologies with other existing methods that, to ourknowledge, have not been frequently considered in these particular settings. Aunifying principle among these techniques is that the test data used in eachiteration of the resampling procedure should reflect the new observations towhich the model will be applied, while the training data should berepresentative of the entire data set used to obtain the final model. Beyondproviding an overview, we address literature gaps by conducting simulationstudies. These studies assess the necessity of using GE-estimation methodstailored to the respective setting.

Nonetheless, the inherentvariability of solar irradiance poses a significant challenge for seamlesslyintegrating solar power into the electrical grid. While the majority of priorresearch has centered on employing purely time series-based methodologies forsolar forecasting, only a limited number of studies have taken into accountfactors such as cloud cover or the surrounding physical context. In this paper,we put forth a deep learning architecture designed to harness spatio-temporalcontext using satellite data, to attain highly accurate \textit{day-ahead}time-series forecasting for any given station, with a particular emphasis onforecasting Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). We also suggest a methodologyto extract a distribution for each time step prediction, which can serve as avery valuable measure of uncertainty attached to the forecast. When evaluatingmodels, we propose a testing scheme in which we separate particularly difficultexamples from easy ones, in order to capture the model performances in crucialsituations, which in the case of this study are the days suffering from varyingcloudy conditions. Furthermore, we present a new multi-modal dataset gatheringsatellite imagery over a large zone and time series for solar irradiance andother related physical variables from multiple geographically diverse solarstations.

In contrast,large-scale pre-trained models such as CLIP demonstrate remarkable few-shot andzero-shot capabilities. To enhance the performance of pre-trained models fordownstream tasks, fine-tuning the model on downstream data is frequentlynecessary. However, fine-tuning the pre-trained model leads to a decrease inits generalizability in the presence of distribution shift, while the limitednumber of samples in few-shot learning makes the model highly susceptible tooverfitting. Consequently, existing methods for fine-tuning few-shot learningprimarily focus on fine-tuning the model's classification head or introducingadditional structure. In this paper, we introduce a fine-tuning approach termedFeature Discrimination Alignment (FD-Align). Our method aims to bolster themodel's generalizability by preserving the consistency of spurious featuresacross the fine-tuning process. Extensive experimental results validate theefficacy of our approach for both ID and OOD tasks. Once fine-tuned, the modelcan seamlessly integrate with existing methods, leading to performanceimprovements.

In this paper, weinvestigate integrating the preceding textual context into both the$\textit{rewriting}$ and $\textit{evaluation}$ stages of stylistic textrewriting, and introduce a new composite contextual evaluation metric$\texttt{CtxSimFit}$ that combines similarity to the original sentence withcontextual cohesiveness. We comparatively evaluate non-contextual andcontextual rewrites in formality, toxicity, and sentiment transfer tasks. Ourexperiments show that humans significantly prefer contextual rewrites as morefitting and natural over non-contextual ones, yet existing sentence-levelautomatic metrics (e.g., ROUGE, SBERT) correlate poorly with human preferences($\rho$=0--0.3). In contrast, human preferences are much better reflected byboth our novel $\texttt{CtxSimFit}$ ($\rho$=0.7--0.9) as well as proposedcontext-infused versions of common metrics ($\rho$=0.4--0.7).

But it canalso be problematic since it can induce inconsistencies in, e.g., Hessian-basedflatness measures, optimization trajectories, and modes of probabilitydensities. This complicates downstream analyses: e.g. one cannot definitivelyrelate flatness with generalization since arbitrary reparametrization changestheir relationship. In this work, we study the invariance of neural nets underreparametrization from the perspective of Riemannian geometry. From this pointof view, invariance is an inherent property of any neural net if one explicitlyrepresents the metric and uses the correct associated transformation rules.This is important since although the metric is always present, it is oftenimplicitly assumed as identity, and thus dropped from the notation, then lostunder reparametrization. We discuss implications for measuring the flatness ofminima, optimization, and for probability-density maximization. Finally, weexplore some interesting directions where invariance is useful.</description><author>Agustinus Kristiadi, Felix Dangel, Philipp Hennig</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:04:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07384v3</guid></item><item><title>Acquiring Weak Annotations for Tumor Localization in Temporal and Volumetric Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15098v1</link><description>Creating large-scale and well-annotated datasets to train AI algorithms iscrucial for automated tumor detection and localization. However, with limitedresources, it is challenging to determine the best type of annotations whenannotating massive amounts of unlabeled data. To address this issue, we focuson polyps in colonoscopy videos and pancreatic tumors in abdominal CT scans;both applications require significant effort and time for pixel-wise annotationdue to the high dimensional nature of the data, involving either temporary orspatial dimensions. In this paper, we develop a new annotation strategy, termedDrag&amp;Drop, which simplifies the annotation process to drag and drop. Thisannotation strategy is more efficient, particularly for temporal and volumetricimaging, than other types of weak annotations, such as per-pixel, boundingboxes, scribbles, ellipses, and points. Furthermore, to exploit our Drag&amp;Dropannotations, we develop a novel weakly supervised learning method based on thewatershed algorithm. Experimental results show that our method achieves betterdetection and localization performance than alternative weak annotations and,more importantly, achieves similar performance to that trained on detailedper-pixel annotations. Interestingly, we find that, with limited resources,allocating weak annotations from a diverse patient population can foster modelsmore robust to unseen images than allocating per-pixel annotations for a smallset of images. In summary, this research proposes an efficient annotationstrategy for tumor detection and localization that is less accurate thanper-pixel annotations but useful for creating large-scale datasets forscreening tumors in various medical modalities.</description><author>Yu-Cheng Chou, Bowen Li, Deng-Ping Fan, Alan Yuille, Zongwei Zhou</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:03:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15098v1</guid></item><item><title>A Canonical Data Transformation for Achieving Inter- and Within-group Fairness</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15097v1</link><description>Increases in the deployment of machine learning algorithms for applicationsthat deal with sensitive data have brought attention to the issue of fairnessin machine learning. Many works have been devoted to applications that requiredifferent demographic groups to be treated fairly. However, algorithms that aimto satisfy inter-group fairness (also called group fairness) may inadvertentlytreat individuals within the same demographic group unfairly. To address thisissue, we introduce a formal definition of within-group fairness that maintainsfairness among individuals from within the same group. We propose apre-processing framework to meet both inter- and within-group fairness criteriawith little compromise in accuracy. The framework maps the feature vectors ofmembers from different groups to an inter-group-fair canonical domain beforefeeding them into a scoring function. The mapping is constructed to preservethe relative relationship between the scores obtained from the unprocessedfeature vectors of individuals from the same demographic group, guaranteeingwithin-group fairness.

Unfortunately, this preprocessing step is vulnerable to so-calledimage-scaling attacks where an attacker makes unnoticeable changes to an imageso that it becomes a new image after scaling. This opens up new ways forattackers to control the prediction or to improve poisoning and backdoorattacks. While effective techniques exist to prevent scaling attacks, theirdetection has not been rigorously studied yet. Consequently, it is currentlynot possible to reliably spot these attacks in practice. This paper presents the first in-depth systematization and analysis ofdetection methods for image-scaling attacks. We identify two general detectionparadigms and derive novel methods from them that are simple in design yetsignificantly outperform previous work. We demonstrate the efficacy of thesemethods in a comprehensive evaluation with all major learning platforms andscaling algorithms. First, we show that image-scaling attacks modifying theentire scaled image can be reliably detected even under an adaptive adversary.Second, we find that our methods provide strong detection performance even ifonly minor parts of the image are manipulated. As a result, we can introduce anovel protection layer against image-scaling attacks.</description><author>Erwin Quiring, Andreas M√ºller, Konrad Rieck</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 17:46:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15085v1</guid></item><item><title>Quantum Federated Learning With Quantum Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15084v1</link><description>A major concern of deep learning models is the large amount of data that isrequired to build and train them, much of which is reliant on sensitive andpersonally identifiable information that is vulnerable to access by thirdparties. Ideas of using the quantum internet to address this issue have beenpreviously proposed, which would enable fast and completely secure onlinecommunications. Previous work has yielded a hybrid quantum-classical transferlearning scheme for classical data and communication with a hub-spoke topology.While quantum communication is secure from eavesdrop attacks and nomeasurements from quantum to classical translation, due to no cloning theorem,hub-spoke topology is not ideal for quantum communication without quantummemory. Here we seek to improve this model by implementing a decentralized ringtopology for the federated learning scheme, where each client is given aportion of the entire dataset and only performs training on that set. We alsodemonstrate the first successful use of quantum weights for quantum federatedlearning, which allows us to perform our training entirely in quantum.</description><author>Tyler Wang, Huan-Hsin Tseng, Shinjae Yoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 17:45:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15084v1</guid></item><item><title>Beyond Labels: Empowering Human Annotators with Natural Language Explanations through a Novel Active-Learning Architecture</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12710v2</link><description>Real-world domain experts (e.g., doctors) rarely annotate only a decisionlabel in their day-to-day workflow without providing explanations. Yet,existing low-resource learning techniques, such as Active Learning (AL), thataim to support human annotators mostly focus on the label while neglecting thenatural language explanation of a data point. This work proposes a novel ALarchitecture to support experts' real-world need for label and explanationannotations in low-resource scenarios. Our AL architecture leverages anexplanation-generation model to produce explanations guided by humanexplanations, a prediction model that utilizes generated explanations towardprediction faithfully, and a novel data diversity-based AL sampling strategythat benefits from the explanation annotations. Automated and human evaluationsdemonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating explanations into AL samplingand the improved human annotation efficiency and trustworthiness with our ALarchitecture. Additional ablation studies illustrate the potential of our ALarchitecture for transfer learning, generalizability, and integration withlarge language models (LLMs). While LLMs exhibit exceptionalexplanation-generation capabilities for relatively simple tasks, theireffectiveness in complex real-world tasks warrants further in-depth study.</description><author>Bingsheng Yao, Ishan Jindal, Lucian Popa, Yannis Katsis, Sayan Ghosh, Lihong He, Yuxuan Lu, Shashank Srivastava, Yunyao Li, James Hendler, Dakuo Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 17:44:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12710v2</guid></item><item><title>E4S: Fine-grained Face Swapping via Editing With Regional GAN Inversion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15081v1</link><description>This paper proposes a novel approach to face swapping from the perspective offine-grained facial editing, dubbed "editing for swapping" (E4S). Thetraditional face swapping methods rely on global feature extraction and oftenfail to preserve the source identity. In contrast, our framework proposes aRegional GAN Inversion (RGI) method, which allows the explicit disentanglementof shape and texture. Specifically, our E4S performs face swapping in thelatent space of a pretrained StyleGAN, where a multi-scale mask-guided encoderis applied to project the texture of each facial component into regional stylecodes and a mask-guided injection module then manipulates feature maps with thestyle codes. Based on this disentanglement, face swapping can be simplified asstyle and mask swapping. Besides, since reconstructing the source face in thetarget image may lead to disharmony lighting, we propose to train a re-coloringnetwork to make the swapped face maintain the lighting condition on the targetface. Further, to deal with the potential mismatch area during mask exchange,we designed a face inpainting network as post-processing. The extensivecomparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our E4S outperformsexisting methods in preserving texture, shape, and lighting.

However, the training process of LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) generally incurs the update of significant parameters,which limits the applicability of FL techniques to tackle the LLMs in realscenarios. Prompt tuning can significantly reduce the number of parameters toupdate, but it either incurs performance degradation or low trainingefficiency. The straightforward utilization of prompt tuning in the FL oftenraises non-trivial communication costs and dramatically degrades performance.In addition, the decentralized data is generally non-Independent andIdentically Distributed (non-IID), which brings client drift problems and thuspoor performance. This paper proposes a Parameter-efficient prompt Tuningapproach with Adaptive Optimization, i.e., FedPepTAO, to enable efficient andeffective FL of LLMs. First, an efficient partial prompt tuning approach isproposed to improve performance and efficiency simultaneously. Second, a noveladaptive optimization method is developed to address the client drift problemson both the device and server sides to enhance performance further. Extensiveexperiments based on 10 datasets demonstrate the superb performance (up to60.8\% in terms of accuracy) and efficiency (up to 97.59\% in terms of trainingtime) of FedPepTAO compared with 9 baseline approaches.

It shifts the traditional paradigm ofdiscrete architecture sampling and evaluation to differentiable super-netoptimization and discretization. However, existing DAS methods either onlyconduct coarse-grained operation-level search, or restrictively explorefine-grained filter-level and weight-level units using manually-definedremaining ratios, which fail to simultaneously achieve small model size andsatisfactory model performance. Additionally, they address the high memoryconsumption of the search process at the expense of search quality. To tacklethese issues, we introduce multi-granularity architecture search (MGAS), aunified framework which aims to comprehensively and memory-efficiently explorethe multi-granularity search space to discover both effective and efficientneural networks. Specifically, we learn discretization functions specific toeach granularity level to adaptively determine the remaining ratios accordingto the evolving architecture. This ensures an optimal balance among units ofdifferent granularity levels for different target model sizes. Considering thememory demands, we break down the super-net optimization and discretizationinto multiple sub-net stages. By allowing re-pruning and regrowing of units inprevious sub-nets during subsequent stages, we compensate for potential bias inearlier stages. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNetdemonstrate that MGAS outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in achieving abetter trade-off between model performance and model size.</description><author>Xiaoyun Liu, Divya Saxena, Jiannong Cao, Yuqing Zhao, Penghui Ruan</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 17:32:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15074v1</guid></item><item><title>RD-VIO: Robust Visual-Inertial Odometry for Mobile Augmented Reality in Dynamic Environments</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15072v1</link><description>It is typically challenging for visual or visual-inertial odometry systems tohandle the problems of dynamic scenes and pure rotation.

Firstly, we propose an IMU-PARSAC algorithm whichcan robustly detect and match keypoints in a two-stage process. In the firststate, landmarks are matched with new keypoints using visual and IMUmeasurements. We collect statistical information from the matching and thenguide the intra-keypoint matching in the second stage.

We makethe pure-rotational frames into the special subframes. When solving thevisual-inertial bundle adjustment, they provide additional constraints to thepure-rotational motion.

As each generative model produces a distribution ofimages, we formulate the search task as an optimization problem to select themodel with the highest probability of generating similar content as the query.We introduce a formulation to approximate this probability given the query fromdifferent modalities, e.g., image, sketch, and text.

The graph pooling operator, acrucial element of GCNs, enhances the representation learning capability andfacilitates the acquisition of abnormal brain maps. However, most existingresearch designs graph pooling operators solely from the perspective of nodeswhile disregarding the original edge features, in a way that not only confinesgraph pooling application scenarios, but also diminishes its ability to capturecritical substructures. To design a graph clustering pooling operator that istailored to dominant edge features, we proposed the edge-aware hard clusteringgraph pool (EHCPool) and redefined the graph clustering process. Specifically,the 'Edge-to-node' criterion was proposed to evaluate the significance of bothedge and node features. Guided by edge scores, we designed a revolutionaryIteration n-top strategy, aimed at adaptively learning sparse hard clusteringassignments for graphs. Subsequently, a novel N-E Aggregation strategy isintroduced to aggregate node and edge information in each independent subgraph.Extensive experiments on the multi-site public datasets demonstrate thesuperiority and robustness of the proposed model.

Oneimportant step towards this goal is to localize and track key active objectsthat undergo major state change as a consequence of human actions/interactionsto the environment without being told exactly what/where to ground (e.g.,localizing and tracking the `sponge` in video from the instruction "Dip the`sponge` into the bucket."). While existing works approach this problem from apure vision perspective, we investigate to which extent the textual modality(i.e., task instructions) and their interaction with visual modality can bebeneficial. Specifically, we propose to improve phrase grounding models'ability on localizing the active objects by: (1) learning the role of `objectsundergoing change` and extracting them accurately from the instructions, (2)leveraging pre- and post-conditions of the objects during actions, and (3)recognizing the objects more robustly with descriptional knowledge. We leveragelarge language models (LLMs) to extract the aforementioned action-objectknowledge, and design a per-object aggregation masking technique to effectivelyperform joint inference on object phrases and symbolic knowledge.

We theoretically and empirically study the effect of normalization inSAM for both convex and non-convex functions, revealing two key roles played bynormalization: i) it helps in stabilizing the algorithm; and ii) it enables thealgorithm to drift along a continuum (manifold) of minima -- a propertyidentified by recent theoretical works that is the key to better performance.We further argue that these two properties of normalization make SAM robustagainst the choice of hyper-parameters, supporting the practicality of SAM.

In order to successfullyaccomplish the VON task, two essential conditions must be fulfilled:1) the usermust know the name of the desired object; and 2) the user-specified object mustactually be present within the scene. To meet these conditions, a simulator canincorporate pre-defined object names and positions into the metadata of thescene. However, in real-world scenarios, it is often challenging to ensure thatthese conditions are always met. Human in an unfamiliar environment may notknow which objects are present in the scene, or they may mistakenly specify anobject that is not actually present. Nevertheless, despite these challenges,human may still have a demand for an object, which could potentially befulfilled by other objects present within the scene in an equivalent manner.Hence, we propose Demand-driven Navigation (DDN), which leverages the user'sdemand as the task instruction and prompts the agent to find the object matchesthe specified demand. DDN aims to relax the stringent conditions of VON byfocusing on fulfilling the user's demand rather than relying solely onpredefined object categories or names. We propose a method first acquiretextual attribute features of objects by extracting common knowledge from alarge language model. These textual attribute features are subsequently alignedwith visual attribute features using Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training(CLIP). By incorporating the visual attribute features as prior knowledge, weenhance the navigation process.

We formulate a novel evaluation method of "fairexplanations" using not just accuracy and label time, but also psychologicalimpact of explanations on different user groups across many metrics (mentaldiscomfort, stereotype activation, and perceived workload).

This isessential for addressing the challenges of data storage and training costs.Prevalent methods facilitate knowledge transfer by matching the gradients,embedding distributions, or training trajectories of synthetic images withthose of the sampled original images. Although there are various matchingobjectives, currently the strategy for selecting original images is limited tonaive random sampling. We argue that random sampling overlooks the evenness ofthe selected sample distribution, which may result in noisy or biased matchingtargets. Besides, the sample diversity is also not constrained by randomsampling. Additionally, current methods predominantly focus onsingle-dimensional matching, where information is not fully utilized. Toaddress these challenges, we propose a novel matching strategy called DatasetDistillation by Bidirectional REpresentAtive Matching (DREAM+), which selectsrepresentative original images for bidirectional matching. DREAM+ is applicableto a variety of mainstream dataset distillation frameworks and significantlyreduces the number of distillation iterations by more than 15 times withoutaffecting performance. Given sufficient training time, DREAM+ can furtherimprove the performance and achieve state-of-the-art results.

This interest has supported the development of a multitude ofsoftware frameworks (e.g. Qiskit, Pennylane, Braket) to implement, simulate,and execute quantum algorithms. Most of them allow us to define quantumcircuits, run basic quantum algorithms, and access low-level primitivesdepending on the hardware such software is supposed to run. For mostexperiments, these frameworks have to be manually integrated within a largermachine learning software pipeline. The researcher is in charge of knowingdifferent software packages, integrating them through the development of longcode scripts, analyzing the results, and generating the plots. Long code oftenleads to erroneous applications, due to the average number of bugs growingproportional with respect to the program length. Moreover, other researcherswill struggle to understand and reproduce the experiment, due to the need to befamiliar with all the different software frameworks involved in the codescript. We propose QuASK, an open-source quantum machine learning frameworkwritten in Python that aids the researcher in performing their experiments,with particular attention to quantum kernel techniques. QuASK can be used as acommand-line tool to download datasets, pre-process them, quantum machinelearning routines, analyze and visualize the results. QuASK implements moststate-of-the-art algorithms to analyze the data through quantum kernels, withthe possibility to use projected kernels, (gradient-descent) trainable quantumkernels, and structure-optimized quantum kernels. Our framework can also beused as a library and integrated into pre-existing software, maximizing codereuse.</description><author>Francesco Di Marcantonio, Massimiliano Incudini, Davide Tezza, Michele Grossi</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 16:52:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15284v2</guid></item><item><title>Meta- (out-of-context) learning in neural networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15047v1</link><description>Brown et al.

Whileit offers convenience, it is also more vulnerable to spoofing using variouspresentation attack instruments (PAI). The contactless fingerprint is anemerging biometric authentication but has not yet been heavily investigated foranti-spoofing. While existing anti-spoofing approaches demonstrated fairresults, they have encountered challenges in terms of universality andscalability to detect any unseen/unknown spoofed samples. To address thisissue, we propose a universal presentation attack detection method forcontactless fingerprints, despite having limited knowledge of presentationattack samples. We generated synthetic contactless fingerprints using StyleGANfrom live finger photos and integrating them to train a semi-supervisedResNet-18 model. A novel joint loss function, combining the Arcface and Centerloss, is introduced with a regularization to balance between the two lossfunctions and minimize the variations within the live samples while enhancingthe inter-class variations between the deepfake and live samples. We alsoconducted a comprehensive comparison of different regularizations' impact onthe joint loss function for presentation attack detection (PAD) and exploredthe performance of a modified ResNet-18 architecture with different activationfunctions (i.e., leaky ReLU and RelU) in conjunction with Arcface and centerloss. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the model using unseen types ofspoof attacks and live data. Our proposed method achieves a Bona FideClassification Error Rate (BPCER) of 0.12\%, an Attack PresentationClassification Error Rate (APCER) of 0.63\%, and an Average ClassificationError Rate (ACER) of 0.37\%.</description><author>Banafsheh Adami, Sara Tehranipoor, Nasser Nasrabadi, Nima Karimian</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 16:46:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15044v1</guid></item><item><title>CalibrationPhys: Self-supervised Video-based Heart and Respiratory Rate Measurements by Calibrating Between Multiple Cameras</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15043v1</link><description>Video-based heart and respiratory rate measurements using facial videos aremore useful and user-friendly than traditional contact-based sensors. However,most of the current deep learning approaches require ground-truth pulse andrespiratory waves for model training, which are expensive to collect. In thispaper, we propose CalibrationPhys, a self-supervised video-based heart andrespiratory rate measurement method that calibrates between multiple cameras.CalibrationPhys trains deep learning models without supervised labels by usingfacial videos captured simultaneously by multiple cameras. Contrastive learningis performed so that the pulse and respiratory waves predicted from thesynchronized videos using multiple cameras are positive and those fromdifferent videos are negative. CalibrationPhys also improves the robustness ofthe models by means of a data augmentation technique and successfully leveragesa pre-trained model for a particular camera. Experimental results utilizing twodatasets demonstrate that CalibrationPhys outperforms state-of-the-art heartand respiratory rate measurement methods. Since we optimize camera-specificmodels using only videos from multiple cameras, our approach makes it easy touse arbitrary cameras for heart and respiratory rate measurements.</description><author>Yusuke Akamatsu, Terumi Umematsu, Hitoshi Imaoka</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 16:46:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15043v1</guid></item><item><title>Variational Imbalanced Regression: Fair Uncertainty Quantification via Probabilistic Smoothing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06599v6</link><description>Existing regression models tend to fall short in both accuracy anduncertainty estimation when the label distribution is imbalanced.

Different from typical variational autoencoders assuming I.I.D.representations (a data point's representation is not directly affected byother data points), our VIR borrows data with similar regression labels tocompute the latent representation's variational distribution; furthermore,different from deterministic regression models producing point estimates, VIRpredicts the entire normal-inverse-gamma distributions and modulates theassociated conjugate distributions to impose probabilistic reweighting on theimbalanced data, thereby providing better uncertainty estimation. Experimentsin several real-world datasets show that our VIR can outperformstate-of-the-art imbalanced regression models in terms of both accuracy anduncertainty estimation.

It is especially true inthe field of tamper detection. This paper proposes a modified total variationnoise reduction method to acquire high-quality tampered images. Weautomatically crawl original and tampered images from the Baidu PS Bar. BaiduPS Bar is a website where net friends post countless tampered images.Subtracting the original image with the tampered image can highlight thetampered area. However, there is also substantial noise on the final print, sothese images can't be directly used in the deep learning model. Our modifiedtotal variation noise reduction method is aimed at solving this problem.Because a lot of text is slender, it is easy to lose text information after theopening and closing operation. We use MSER (Maximally Stable Extremal Regions)and NMS (Non-maximum Suppression) technology to extract text information. Andthen use the modified total variation noise reduction technology to process thesubtracted image. Finally, we can obtain an image with little noise by addingthe image and text information. And the idea also largely retains the textinformation. Datasets generated in this way can be used in deep learningmodels, and they will help the model achieve better results.</description><author>Xinyu Yang, Jizhe Zhou</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 16:40:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15041v1</guid></item><item><title>SLOG: A Structural Generalization Benchmark for Semantic Parsing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15040v1</link><description>The goal of compositional generalization benchmarks is to evaluate how wellmodels generalize to new complex linguistic expressions.

We introduceSLOG, a semantic parsing dataset that extends COGS (Kim and Linzen, 2020) with17 structural generalization cases.

Although both play a role in drivers' gaze allocation, most ofthe existing modeling approaches apply techniques developed for bottom-upsaliency and do not consider task and context influences explicitly. Likewise,common driving attention benchmarks lack relevant task and context annotations.Therefore, to enable analysis and modeling of these factors for drivers' gazeprediction, we propose the following: 1) address some shortcomings of thepopular DR(eye)VE dataset and extend it with per-frame annotations for drivingtask and context; 2) benchmark a number of baseline and SOTA models forsaliency and driver gaze prediction and analyze them w.r.t. the newannotations; and finally, 3) a novel model that modulates drivers' gazeprediction with explicit action and context information, and as a resultsignificantly improves SOTA performance on DR(eye)VE overall (by 24\% KLD and89\% NSS) and on a subset of action and safety-critical intersection scenarios(by 10--30\% KLD).

Abarrier is that their predictions cannot be attributed to individual features,as they compare two inputs rather than processing a single one. This paperderives a local attribution method for Siamese encoders by generalizing theprinciple of integrated gradients to models with multiple inputs. The solutiontakes the form of feature-pair attributions, and can be reduced to atoken-token matrix for STs. Our method involves the introduction of integratedJacobians and inherits the advantageous formal properties of integratedgradients: it accounts for the model's full computation graph and is guaranteedto converge to the actual prediction. A pilot study shows that in an ST fewtoken-pairs can often explain large fractions of predictions, and it focuses onnouns and verbs.

Across a range of topicand sentiment datasets, our method is more accurate than zero-shot by 17-19%absolute. It is also more robust to choices required for zero-shotclassification, such as patterns for prompting the model to classify andmappings from labels to tokens in the model's vocabulary.

The proposed structure jointly optimizes the two encoder/decoderpairs and generates interference-aware constellations that dynamically adapttheir shape based on interference intensity to minimize the bit error rate(BER). An in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) power allocation layer is introducedin the DAE to guarantee an average power constraint and enable the architectureto generate constellations with nonuniform shapes. This brings further gaincompared to standard uniform constellations such as quadrature amplitudemodulation. The proposed structure is then extended to work with imperfectchannel state information (CSI). The CSI imperfection due to both theestimation and quantization errors are examined. The performance of the DAEZICis compared with two baseline methods, i.e., standard and rotatedconstellations. The proposed structure significantly enhances the performanceof the ZIC both for the perfect and imperfect CSI. Simulation results show thatthe improvement is achieved in all interference regimes (weak, moderate, andstrong) and consistently increases with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Forexample, more than an order of magnitude BER reduction is obtained with respectto the most competitive conventional method at weak interference when SNR&gt;15dBand two bits per symbol are transmitted.

Developing real-time data compression algorithms to reducesuch data at high throughput to fit permanent storage has drawn increasingattention. Specifically, at the newly constructed sPHENIX experiment at theRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), a time projection chamber is used asthe main tracking detector, which records particle trajectories in a volume ofa three-dimensional (3D) cylinder. The resulting data are usually very sparsewith occupancy around 10.8%. Such sparsity presents a challenge to conventionallearning-free lossy compression algorithms, such as SZ, ZFP, and MGARD. The 3Dconvolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach, Bicephalous ConvolutionalAutoencoder (BCAE), outperforms traditional methods both in compression rateand reconstruction accuracy. BCAE can also utilize the computation power ofgraphical processing units suitable for deployment in a modern heterogeneoushigh-performance computing environment. This work introduces two BCAE variants:BCAE++ and BCAE-2D. BCAE++ achieves a 15% better compression ratio and a 77%better reconstruction accuracy measured in mean absolute error compared withBCAE. BCAE-2D treats the radial direction as the channel dimension of an image,resulting in a 3x speedup in compression throughput. In addition, wedemonstrate an unbalanced autoencoder with a larger decoder can improvereconstruction accuracy without significantly sacrificing throughput.

However,transformers are computationally expensive, which limits their applications inreal-time tasks such as autonomous driving. In addition, an efficient local andglobal feature selection and fusion are vital for accurate dense prediction,especially driving scene understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose areal-time semantic segmentation architecture named Pyramid Pooling AxialTransformer (P2AT). The proposed P2AT takes a coarse feature from the CNNencoder to produce scale-aware contextual features, which are then combinedwith the multi-level feature aggregation scheme to produce enhanced contextualfeatures. Specifically, we introduce a pyramid pooling axial transformer tocapture intricate spatial and channel dependencies, leading to improvedperformance on semantic segmentation. Then, we design a Bidirectional Fusionmodule (BiF) to combine semantic information at different levels. Meanwhile, aGlobal Context Enhancer is introduced to compensate for the inadequacy ofconcatenating different semantic levels. Finally, a decoder block is proposedto help maintain a larger receptive field. We evaluate P2AT variants on threechallenging scene-understanding datasets. In particular, our P2AT variantsachieve state-of-art results on the Camvid dataset 80.5%, 81.0%, 81.1% forP2AT-S, P2ATM, and P2AT-L, respectively. Furthermore, our experiment onCityscapes and Pascal VOC 2012 have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposedarchitecture, with results showing that P2AT-M, achieves 78.7% on Cityscapes.The source code will be available at</description><author>Mohammed A.

We introduce SONIC (SONar Image Correspondence), apose-supervised network designed to yield robust feature correspondence capableof withstanding viewpoint variations. The inherent complexity of the underwaterenvironment stems from the dynamic and frequently limited visibilityconditions, restricting vision to a few meters of often featureless expanses.This makes camera-based systems suboptimal in most open water applicationscenarios. Consequently, multibeam imaging sonars emerge as the preferredchoice for perception sensors. However, they too are not without theirlimitations. While imaging sonars offer superior long-range visibility comparedto cameras, their measurements can appear different from varying viewpoints.This inherent variability presents formidable challenges in data association,particularly for feature-based methods.

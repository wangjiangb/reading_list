The research focus is now shifting towards the controllability ofDMs. A significant challenge within this domain is localized editing, wherespecific areas of an image are modified without affecting the rest of thecontent. This paper introduces LIME for localized image editing in diffusionmodels that do not require user-specified regions of interest (RoI) oradditional text input. Our method employs features from pre-trained methods anda simple clustering technique to obtain precise semantic segmentation maps.Then, by leveraging cross-attention maps, it refines these segments forlocalized edits. Finally, we propose a novel cross-attention regularizationtechnique that penalizes unrelated cross-attention scores in the RoI during thedenoising steps, ensuring localized edits. Our approach, without re-trainingand fine-tuning, consistently improves the performance of existing methods invarious editing benchmarks.</description><author>Enis Simsar, Alessio Tonioni, Yongqin Xian, Thomas Hofmann, Federico Tombari</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 18:59:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09256v1</guid></item><item><title>Revisiting Depth Completion from a Stereo Matching Perspective for Cross-domain Generalization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09254v1</link><description>This paper proposes a new framework for depth completion robust againstdomain-shifting issues. It exploits the generalization capability of modernstereo networks to face depth completion, by processing fictitious stereo pairsobtained through a virtual pattern projection paradigm.

While ControlNet provides control over the geometric form of theinstances in the generated image, it lacks the capability to dictate the visualappearance of each instance. We present FineControlNet to provide fine controlover each instance's appearance while maintaining the precise pose controlcapability. Specifically, we develop and demonstrate FineControlNet withgeometric control via human pose images and appearance control viainstance-level text prompts. The spatial alignment of instance-specific textprompts and 2D poses in latent space enables the fine control capabilities ofFineControlNet. We evaluate the performance of FineControlNet with rigorouscomparison against state-of-the-art pose-conditioned text-to-image diffusionmodels. FineControlNet achieves superior performance in generating images thatfollow the user-provided instance-specific text prompts and poses compared withexisting methods.

VL-GPT achieves a unified pre-trainingapproach for both image and text modalities by employing a straightforwardauto-regressive objective, thereby enabling the model to process image and textas seamlessly as a language model processes text. To accomplish this, weinitially propose a novel image tokenizer-detokenizer framework for visualdata, specifically designed to transform raw images into a sequence ofcontinuous embeddings and reconstruct them accordingly. In combination with theexisting text tokenizer and detokenizer, this framework allows for the encodingof interleaved image-text data into a multimodal sequence, which cansubsequently be fed into the transformer model. Consequently, VL-GPT canperform large-scale pre-training on multimodal corpora utilizing a unifiedauto-regressive objective (i.e., next-token prediction). Upon completion ofpre-training, VL-GPT exhibits remarkable zero-shot and few-shot performanceacross a diverse range of vision and language understanding and generationtasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, text-to-imagegeneration, and more. Additionally, the pre-trained model retrains in-contextlearning capabilities when provided with multimodal prompts. We further conductinstruction tuning on our VL-GPT, highlighting its exceptional potential formultimodal assistance. The source code and model weights shall be released.</description><author>Jinguo Zhu, Xiaohan Ding, Yixiao Ge, Yuying Ge, Sijie Zhao, Hengshuang Zhao, Xiaohua Wang, Ying Shan</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 18:59:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09251v1</guid></item><item><title>Single Mesh Diffusion Models with Field Latents for Texture Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09250v1</link><description>We introduce a framework for intrinsic latent diffusion models operatingdirectly on the surfaces of 3D shapes, with the goal of synthesizinghigh-quality textures. Our approach is underpinned by two contributions: fieldlatents, a latent representation encoding textures as discrete vector fields onthe mesh vertices, and field latent diffusion models, which learn to denoise adiffusion process in the learned latent space on the surface. We consider asingle-textured-mesh paradigm, where our models are trained to generatevariations of a given texture on a mesh. We show the synthesized textures areof superior fidelity compared those from existing single-textured-meshgenerative models. Our models can also be adapted for user-controlled editingtasks such as inpainting and label-guided generation. The efficacy of ourapproach is due in part to the equivariance of our proposed framework underisometries, allowing our models to seamlessly reproduce details across locallysimilar regions and opening the door to a notion of generative texturetransfer.</description><author>Thomas W.

Current breakthroughs like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) havedemonstrated high-fidelity image synthesis but struggle with sparse inputviews. Existing methods, such as Generalizable NeRFs and per-scene optimizationapproaches, face limitations in data dependency, computational cost, andgeneralization across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, wepropose ZeroRF, whose key idea is to integrate a tailored Deep Image Prior intoa factorized NeRF representation. Unlike traditional methods, ZeroRFparametrizes feature grids with a neural network generator, enabling efficientsparse view 360{\deg} reconstruction without any pretraining or additionalregularization. Extensive experiments showcase ZeroRF's versatility andsuperiority in terms of both quality and speed, achieving state-of-the-artresults on benchmark datasets.

Thisis achieved via a process called distillation, which transfers knowledge fromthe 2D network to 3D assets. Distillation necessitates at least tens of minutesper asset to attain satisfactory editing results, and is thus not verypractical. In contrast, we ask whether 3D editing can be carried out directlyby a feed-forward network, eschewing test-time optimisation. In particular, wehypothesise that editing can be greatly simplified by first encoding 3D objectsin a suitable latent space. We validate this hypothesis by building upon thelatent space of Shap-E. We demonstrate that direct 3D editing in this space ispossible and efficient by building a feed-forward editor network that onlyrequires approximately one second per edit. Our experiments show thatShap-Editor generalises well to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution 3Dassets with different prompts, exhibiting comparable performance with methodsthat carry out test-time optimisation for each edited instance.</description><author>Minghao Chen, Junyu Xie, Iro Laina, Andrea Vedaldi</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 18:59:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09246v1</guid></item><item><title>DriveMLM: Aligning Multi-Modal Large Language Models with Behavioral Planning States for Autonomous Driving</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09245v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have opened up new possibilities for intelligentagents, endowing them with human-like thinking and cognitive abilities. In thiswork, we delve into the potential of large language models (LLMs) in autonomousdriving (AD). We introduce DriveMLM, an LLM-based AD framework that can performclose-loop autonomous driving in realistic simulators. To this end, (1) webridge the gap between the language decisions and the vehicle control commandsby standardizing the decision states according to the off-the-shelf motionplanning module. (2) We employ a multi-modal LLM (MLLM) to model the behaviorplanning module of a module AD system, which uses driving rules, user commands,and inputs from various sensors (e.g., camera, lidar) as input and makesdriving decisions and provide explanations; This model can plug-and-play inexisting AD systems such as Apollo for close-loop driving. (3) We design aneffective data engine to collect a dataset that includes decision state andcorresponding explanation annotation for model training and evaluation. Weconduct extensive experiments and show that our model achieves 76.1 drivingscore on the CARLA Town05 Long, and surpasses the Apollo baseline by 4.7 pointsunder the same settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model.

Reward Model Ensembles Mitigate but do not Eliminate Reward Hacking</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09244v1</link><description>Reward models play a key role in aligning language model applications towardshuman preferences. However, this setup creates an incentive for the languagemodel to exploit errors in the reward model to achieve high estimated reward, aphenomenon often termed \emph{reward hacking}. A natural mitigation is to trainan ensemble of reward models, aggregating over model outputs to obtain a morerobust reward estimate. We explore the application of reward ensembles toalignment at both training time (through reinforcement learning) and inferencetime (through reranking). First, we show that reward models are\emph{underspecified}: reward models that perform similarly in-distribution canyield very different rewards when used in alignment, due to distribution shift.Second, underspecification results in overoptimization, where alignment to onereward model does not improve reward as measured by another reward modeltrained on the same data. Third, overoptimization is mitigated by the use ofreward ensembles, and ensembles that vary by their \emph{pretraining} seedslead to better generalization than ensembles that differ only by their\emph{fine-tuning} seeds, with both outperforming individual reward models.However, even pretrain reward ensembles do not eliminate reward hacking: weshow several qualitative reward hacking phenomena that are not mitigated byensembling because all reward models in the ensemble exhibit similar errorpatterns.</description><author>Jacob Eisenstein, Chirag Nagpal, Alekh Agarwal, Ahmad Beirami, Alex D'Amour, DJ Dvijotham, Adam Fisch, Katherine Heller, Stephen Pfohl, Deepak Ramachandran, Peter Shaw, Jonathan Berant</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 18:59:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09244v1</guid></item><item><title>OccNeRF: Self-Supervised Multi-Camera Occupancy Prediction with Neural Radiance Fields</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09243v1</link><description>As a fundamental task of vision-based perception, 3D occupancy predictionreconstructs 3D structures of surrounding environments. It provides detailedinformation for autonomous driving planning and navigation. However, mostexisting methods heavily rely on the LiDAR point clouds to generate occupancyground truth, which is not available in the vision-based system. In this paper,we propose an OccNeRF method for self-supervised multi-camera occupancyprediction. Different from bounded 3D occupancy labels, we need to considerunbounded scenes with raw image supervision. To solve the issue, weparameterize the reconstructed occupancy fields and reorganize the samplingstrategy. The neural rendering is adopted to convert occupancy fields tomulti-camera depth maps, supervised by multi-frame photometric consistency.Moreover, for semantic occupancy prediction, we design several strategies topolish the prompts and filter the outputs of a pretrained open-vocabulary 2Dsegmentation model. Extensive experiments for both self-supervised depthestimation and semantic occupancy prediction tasks on nuScenes datasetdemonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description><author>Chubin Zhang, Juncheng Yan, Yi Wei, Jiaxin Li, Li Liu, Yansong Tang, Yueqi Duan, Jiwen Lu</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 18:58:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09243v1</guid></item><item><title>Text2Immersion: Generative Immersive Scene with 3D Gaussians</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09242v1</link><description>We introduce Text2Immersion, an elegant method for producing high-quality 3Dimmersive scenes from text prompts. Our proposed pipeline initiates byprogressively generating a Gaussian cloud using pre-trained 2D diffusion anddepth estimation models. This is followed by a refining stage on the Gaussiancloud, interpolating and refining it to enhance the details of the generatedscene. Distinct from prevalent methods that focus on single object or indoorscenes, or employ zoom-out trajectories, our approach generates diverse sceneswith various objects, even extending to the creation of imaginary scenes.Consequently, Text2Immersion can have wide-ranging implications for variousapplications such as virtual reality, game development, and automated contentcreation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system surpasses othermethods in rendering quality and diversity, further progressing towardstext-driven 3D scene generation.

Thechallenge in exploration efficiency makes it difficult to effectively learncomplex tasks in Minecraft. To address this, this paper introduces an advancedlearning system, named Auto MC-Reward, that leverages Large Language Models(LLMs) to automatically design dense reward functions, thereby enhancing thelearning efficiency. Auto MC-Reward consists of three important components:Reward Designer, Reward Critic, and Trajectory Analyzer. Given the environmentinformation and task descriptions, the Reward Designer first design the rewardfunction by coding an executable Python function with predefined observationinputs. Then, our Reward Critic will be responsible for verifying the code,checking whether the code is self-consistent and free of syntax and semanticerrors. Further, the Trajectory Analyzer summarizes possible failure causes andprovides refinement suggestions according to collected trajectories. In thenext round, Reward Designer will take further refine and iterate the densereward function based on feedback.

Existing vision-language models can describe imagesin natural languages, answer visual-related questions, or perform complexreasoning about the image. However, it is yet unclear how localization tasks,such as word grounding or referring localization, can be performed using largelanguage models. In this work, we aim to develop a vision-language model thatcan take locations, for example, a set of points or boxes, as either inputs oroutputs. When taking locations as inputs, the model performslocation-conditioned captioning, which generates captions for the indicatedobject or region. When generating locations as outputs, our model regressespixel coordinates for each output word generated by the language model, andthus performs dense word grounding. Our model is pre-trained on the LocalizedNarrative dataset, which contains pixel-word-aligned captioning from humanattention. We show our model can be applied to various location-awarevision-language tasks, including referring localization, location-conditionedcaptioning, and dense object captioning, archiving state-of-the-art performanceon RefCOCO and Visual Genome.

Generative modellingparadigms based on denoising diffusion processes emerged as a leading candidateto address this motif scaffolding problem and have shown early experimentalsuccess in some cases. In the diffusion paradigm, motif scaffolding is treatedas a conditional generation task, and several conditional generation protocolswere proposed or imported from the Computer Vision literature. However, most ofthese protocols are motivated heuristically, e.g. via analogies to Langevindynamics, and lack a unifying framework, obscuring connections between thedifferent approaches. In this work, we unify conditional training andconditional sampling procedures under one common framework based on themathematically well-understood Doob's h-transform. This new perspective allowsus to draw connections between existing methods and propose a new variation onexisting conditional training protocols.

An effective shape representationneeds to adhere three design principles: it should allow an efficientconversion of large 3D datasets to the representation form; it should provide agood tradeoff of approximation power versus number of parameters; and it shouldhave a simple tensorial form that is compatible with existing powerful neuralarchitectures. While standard 3D shape representations such as volumetric gridsand point clouds do not adhere to all these principles simultaneously, weadvocate in this paper a new representation that does. We introduce Mosaic-SDF(M-SDF): a simple 3D shape representation that approximates the Signed DistanceFunction (SDF) of a given shape by using a set of local grids spread near theshape's boundary. The M-SDF representation is fast to compute for each shapeindividually making it readily parallelizable; it is parameter efficient as itonly covers the space around the shape's boundary; and it has a simple matrixform, compatible with Transformer-based architectures. We demonstrate theefficacy of the M-SDF representation by using it to train a 3D generative flowmodel including class-conditioned generation with the 3D Warehouse dataset, andtext-to-3D generation using a dataset of about 600k caption-shape pairs.</description><author>Lior Yariv, Omri Puny, Natalia Neverova, Oran Gafni, Yaron Lipman</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 18:52:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09222v1</guid></item><item><title>NestE: Modeling Nested Relational Structures for Knowledge Graph Reasoning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09219v1</link><description>Reasoning with knowledge graphs (KGs) has primarily focused on triple-shapedfacts. Recent advancements have been explored to enhance the semantics of thesefacts by incorporating more potent representations, such as hyper-relationalfacts. However, these approaches are limited to \emph{atomic facts}, whichdescribe a single piece of information. This paper extends beyond \emph{atomicfacts} and delves into \emph{nested facts}, represented by quoted triples wheresubjects and objects are triples themselves (e.g., ((\emph{BarackObama},\emph{holds\_position}, \emph{President}), \emph{succeed\_by},(\emph{DonaldTrump}, \emph{holds\_position}, \emph{President}))). These nestedfacts enable the expression of complex semantics like \emph{situations} overtime and \emph{logical patterns} over entities and relations. In response, weintroduce NestE, a novel KG embedding approach that captures the semantics ofboth atomic and nested factual knowledge. NestE represents each atomic fact asa $1\times3$ matrix, and each nested relation is modeled as a $3\times3$ matrixthat rotates the $1\times3$ atomic fact matrix through matrix multiplication.Each element of the matrix is represented as a complex number in thegeneralized 4D hypercomplex space, including (spherical) quaternions,hyperbolic quaternions, and split-quaternions. Through thorough analysis, wedemonstrate the embedding's efficacy in capturing diverse logical patterns overnested facts, surpassing the confines of first-order logic-like expressions.Our experimental results showcase NestE's significant performance gains overcurrent baselines in triple prediction and conditional link prediction.

However, this approach is susceptible to the existence ofoutlier values in activation. The outlier values in the activation cannegatively affect the performance of fine-tuning language models in thelow-precision regime since they affect the scaling factor and thus makerepresenting smaller values harder. This paper investigates techniques formitigating outlier activation in low-precision integer fine-tuning of thelanguage models. Our proposed novel approach enables us to represent theoutlier activation values in 8-bit integers instead of floating-point (FP16)values. The benefit of using integers for outlier values is that it enables usto use operator tiling to avoid performing 16-bit integer matrix multiplicationto address this problem effectively. We provide theoretical analysis andsupporting experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach inimproving the robustness and performance of low-precision fine-tuned languagemodels.</description><author>Alireza Ghaffari, Justin Yu, Mahsa Ghazvini Nejad, Masoud Asgharian, Boxing Chen, Vahid Partovi Nia</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 18:41:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09211v1</guid></item><item><title>WikiMuTe: A web-sourced dataset of semantic descriptions for music audio</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09207v1</link><description>Multi-modal deep learning techniques for matching free-form text with musichave shown promising results in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR).Prior work is often based on large proprietary data while publicly availabledatasets are few and small in size.

Inthis paper, we propose a novel de-randomized diffusion process, which leads toan accelerated algorithm for discrete diffusion models. Our techniquesignificantly reduces the number of function evaluations (i.e., calls to theneural network), making the sampling process much faster. Furthermore, weintroduce a continuous-time (i.e., infinite-step) sampling algorithm that canprovide even better sample qualities than its discrete-time (finite-step)counterpart. Extensive experiments on natural language generation and machinetranslation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our method in termsof both generation speed and sample quality over existing methods for discretediffusion models.</description><author>Zixiang Chen, Huizhuo Yuan, Yongqian Li, Yiwen Kou, Junkai Zhang, Quanquan Gu</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 18:14:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09193v1</guid></item><item><title>Vision-Language Models as a Source of Rewards</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09187v1</link><description>Building generalist agents that can accomplish many goals in rich open-endedenvironments is one of the research frontiers for reinforcement learning.

When solvinglarge-scale PFSS problems, traditional optimization algorithms such asheuristics could hardly meet the demands of both solution accuracy andcomputational efficiency, thus learning-based methods have recently garneredmore attention. Some work attempts to solve the problems by reinforcementlearning methods, which suffer from slow convergence issues during training andare still not accurate enough regarding the solutions. To that end, we proposeto train the model via expert-driven imitation learning, which acceleratesconvergence more stably and accurately. Moreover, in order to extract betterfeature representations of input jobs, we incorporate the graph structure asthe encoder. The extensive experiments reveal that our proposed model obtainssignificant promotion and presents excellent generalizability in large-scaleproblems with up to 1000 jobs. Compared to the state-of-the-art reinforcementlearning method, our model's network parameters are reduced to only 37\% oftheirs, and the solution gap of our model towards the expert solutionsdecreases from 6.8\% to 1.3\% on average.

They operate through a two-steps process: introducingnoise into training samples and then employing a model to convert random noiseinto new samples (e.g., images). However, their remarkable generativeperformance is hindered by slow training and sampling. This is due to thenecessity of tracking extensive forward and reverse diffusion trajectories, andemploying a large model with numerous parameters across multiple timesteps(i.e., noise levels). To tackle these challenges, we present a multi-stageframework inspired by our empirical findings. These observations indicate theadvantages of employing distinct parameters tailored to each timestep whileretaining universal parameters shared across all time steps. Our approachinvolves segmenting the time interval into multiple stages where we employcustom multi-decoder U-net architecture that blends time-dependent models witha universally shared encoder. Our framework enables the efficient distributionof computational resources and mitigates inter-stage interference, whichsubstantially improves training efficiency. Extensive numerical experimentsaffirm the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing significant training andsampling efficiency enhancements on three state-of-the-art diffusion models,including large-scale latent diffusion models.

While such a dataset is crucial for safety monitoring in wildlandfire applications, to the authors' awareness, no such dataset focusing onassets near fire is publicly available. Presumably, this is due to the barrierto entry of collaborating with fire management personnel. We present tworelated data subsets: WIT-UAS-ROS consists of full ROS bag files containingsensor and robot data of UAS flight over the fire, and WIT-UAS-Image containshand-labeled long-wave infrared (LWIR) images extracted from WIT-UAS-ROS. Ourdataset is the first to focus on asset detection in a wildland fireenvironment. We show that thermal detection models trained without fire datafrequently detect false positives by classifying fire as people. By adding ourdataset to training, we show that the false positive rate is reducedsignificantly.

However, Transformers are unique inthat they can implement gradient-based learning algorithms \emph{under simpleparameter configurations}. A line of recent work shows that linear Transformersnaturally learn to implement gradient descent (GD) when trained on a linearregression in-context learning task. But the linearity assumption (either inthe Transformer architecture or in the learning task) is far from realisticsettings where non-linear activations crucially enable Transformers to learncomplicated non-linear functions. In this paper, we provide theoretical andempirical evidence that non-linear Transformers can, and \emph{in fact do},learn to implement learning algorithms to learn non-linear functions incontext. Our results apply to a broad class of combinations of non-lineararchitectures, and non-linear in-context learning tasks. Interestingly, we showthat the optimal choice of non-linear activation depends in a natural way onthe non-linearity of the learning task.</description><author>Xiang Cheng, Yuxin Chen, Suvrit Sra</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 17:19:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06528v2</guid></item><item><title>Split-Ensemble: Efficient OOD-aware Ensemble via Task and Model Splitting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09148v1</link><description>Uncertainty estimation is crucial for machine learning models to detectout-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. However, the conventional discriminative deeplearning classifiers produce uncalibrated closed-set predictions for OOD data.A more robust classifiers with the uncertainty estimation typically require apotentially unavailable OOD dataset for outlier exposure training, or aconsiderable amount of additional memory and compute to build ensemble models.In this work, we improve on uncertainty estimation without extra OOD data oradditional inference costs using an alternative Split-Ensemble method.Specifically, we propose a novel subtask-splitting ensemble training objective,where a common multiclass classification task is split into severalcomplementary subtasks. Then, each subtask's training data can be considered asOOD to the other subtasks. Diverse submodels can therefore be trained on eachsubtask with OOD-aware objectives. The subtask-splitting objective enables usto share low-level features across submodels to avoid parameter andcomputational overheads. In particular, we build a tree-like Split-Ensemblearchitecture by performing iterative splitting and pruning from a sharedbackbone model, where each branch serves as a submodel corresponding to asubtask. This leads to improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation acrosssubmodels under a fixed ensemble computation budget. Empirical study withResNet-18 backbone shows Split-Ensemble, without additional computation cost,improves accuracy over a single model by 0.8%, 1.8%, and 25.5% on CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively.

Prominent among these are methods basedon Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and the adaptation of diffusion models inthe 3D domain. Despite their progress, these techniques often face limitationsdue to slow optimization or rendering processes, leading to extensive trainingand optimization times. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach forsingle-view reconstruction that efficiently generates a 3D model from a singleimage via feed-forward inference. Our method utilizes two transformer-basednetworks, namely a point decoder and a triplane decoder, to reconstruct 3Dobjects using a hybrid Triplane-Gaussian intermediate representation. Thishybrid representation strikes a balance, achieving a faster rendering speedcompared to implicit representations while simultaneously delivering superiorrendering quality than explicit representations. The point decoder is designedfor generating point clouds from single images, offering an explicitrepresentation which is then utilized by the triplane decoder to query Gaussianfeatures for each point. This design choice addresses the challenges associatedwith directly regressing explicit 3D Gaussian attributes characterized by theirnon-structural nature. Subsequently, the 3D Gaussians are decoded by an MLP toenable rapid rendering through splatting. Both decoders are built upon ascalable, transformer-based architecture and have been efficiently trained onlarge-scale 3D datasets. The evaluations conducted on both synthetic datasetsand real-world images demonstrate that our method not only achieves higherquality but also ensures a faster runtime in comparison to previousstate-of-the-art techniques.

Differentfrom the paradigm of previous methods that rely on single-node confidence, inthis paper, we introduce a novel Class-wise Selection for Graph NeuralNetworks, dubbed CSGNN, which employs a neighbor-aggregated latent space toadaptively select reliable nodes across different classes. Specifically, 1) totackle the class imbalance issue, we introduce a dynamic class-wise selectionmechanism, leveraging the clustering technique to identify clean nodes based onthe neighbor-aggregated confidences. In this way, our approach can avoid thepitfalls of biased sampling which is common with global threshold techniques.2) To alleviate the problem of noisy labels, built on the concept of thememorization effect, CSGNN prioritizes learning from clean nodes before noisyones, thereby iteratively enhancing model performance while mitigating labelnoise. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CSGNN outperformsstate-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.</description><author>Yifan Li, Zhen Tan, Kai Shu, Zongsheng Cao, Yu Kong, Huan Liu</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 17:17:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11473v2</guid></item><item><title>Featuring Koopman Mode Decomposition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09146v1</link><description>This article introduces an advanced Koopman mode decomposition (KMD)technique -- coined Featurized Koopman Mode Decomposition (FKMD) -- that usestime embedding and Mahalanobis scaling to enhance analysis and prediction ofhigh dimensional dynamical systems.

In this perspective article, we face the increasingly loudelephant in the room and ask a question that has been hinted at by many but notexplicitly addressed: Can the structure that allows one to avoid barrenplateaus also be leveraged to efficiently simulate the loss classically? Wepresent strong evidence that commonly used models with provable absence ofbarren plateaus are also classically simulable, provided that one can collectsome classical data from quantum devices during an initial data acquisitionphase. This follows from the observation that barren plateaus result from acurse of dimensionality, and that current approaches for solving them end upencoding the problem into some small, classically simulable, subspaces. Thissheds serious doubt on the non-classicality of the information processingcapabilities of parametrized quantum circuits for barren plateau-freelandscapes and on the possibility of superpolynomial advantages from runningthem on quantum hardware.

In this work we introduce the dispatcher/ executor principlefor the design of multi-task Reinforcement Learning controllers. It suggests topartition the controller in two entities, one that understands the task (thedispatcher) and one that computes the controls for the specific device (theexecutor) - and to connect these two by a strongly regularizing communicationchannel. The core rationale behind this position paper is that changes instructure and design principles can improve generalisation properties anddrastically enforce data-efficiency. It is in some sense a 'yes, and ...'response to the current trend of using large neural networks trained on vastamounts of data and bet on emerging generalisation properties.

This nonlinear quantization process poses significant recoverychallenges, particularly with extreme coarse quantization such as 1-bit.Recently, an efficient algorithm called QCS-SGM was proposed for quantized CS(QCS) which utilizes score-based generative models (SGM) as an implicit prior.Due to the adeptness of SGM in capturing the intricate structures of naturalsignals, QCS-SGM substantially outperforms previous QCS methods. However,QCS-SGM is constrained to (approximately) row-orthogonal sensing matrices asthe computation of the likelihood score becomes intractable otherwise. Toaddress this limitation, we introduce an advanced variant of QCS-SGM, termedQCS-SGM+, capable of handling general matrices effectively. The key idea is aBayesian inference perspective on the likelihood score computation, whereinexpectation propagation is employed for its approximate computation.

This comprehensive approach provides a more nuancedunderstanding of the relationship between feature extractors and aggregationmodels, leading to a fairer and more accurate assessment of feature extractormodels in digital pathology.</description><author>Gustav Bredell, Marcel Fischer, Przemyslaw Szostak, Samaneh Abbasi-Sureshjani, Alvaro Gomariz</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 16:34:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17804v2</guid></item><item><title>Subspace Identification for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04723v2</link><description>Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods aim to transfer knowledge frommultiple labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain. Although currentmethods achieve target joint distribution identifiability by enforcing minimalchanges across domains, they often necessitate stringent conditions, such as anadequate number of domains, monotonic transformation of latent variables, andinvariant label distributions. These requirements are challenging to satisfy inreal-world applications. To mitigate the need for these strict assumptions, wepropose a subspace identification theory that guarantees the disentanglement ofdomain-invariant and domain-specific variables under less restrictiveconstraints regarding domain numbers and transformation properties, therebyfacilitating domain adaptation by minimizing the impact of domain shifts oninvariant variables. Based on this theory, we develop a Subspace IdentificationGuarantee (SIG) model that leverages variational inference. Furthermore, theSIG model incorporates class-aware conditional alignment to accommodate targetshifts where label distributions change with the domains. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that our SIG model outperforms existing MSDA techniques on variousbenchmark datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications.</description><author>Zijian Li, Ruichu Cai, Guangyi Chen, Boyang Sun, Zhifeng Hao, Kun Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 16:31:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04723v2</guid></item><item><title>ColNeRF: Collaboration for Generalizable Sparse Input Neural Radiance Field</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09095v1</link><description>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated impressive potential insynthesizing novel views from dense input, however, their effectiveness ischallenged when dealing with sparse input. Existing approaches that incorporateadditional depth or semantic supervision can alleviate this issue to an extent.However, the process of supervision collection is not only costly but alsopotentially inaccurate, leading to poor performance and generalization abilityin diverse scenarios. In our work, we introduce a novel model: theCollaborative Neural Radiance Fields (ColNeRF) designed to work with sparseinput. The collaboration in ColNeRF includes both the cooperation betweensparse input images and the cooperation between the output of the neuralradiation field. Through this, we construct a novel collaborative module thataligns information from various views and meanwhile imposes self-supervisedconstraints to ensure multi-view consistency in both geometry and appearance. ACollaborative Cross-View Volume Integration module (CCVI) is proposed tocapture complex occlusions and implicitly infer the spatial location ofobjects. Moreover, we introduce self-supervision of target rays projected inmultiple directions to ensure geometric and color consistency in adjacentregions. Benefiting from the collaboration at the input and output ends,ColNeRF is capable of capturing richer and more generalized scenerepresentation, thereby facilitating higher-quality results of the novel viewsynthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ColNeRF outperformsstate-of-the-art sparse input generalizable NeRF methods. Furthermore, ourapproach exhibits superiority in fine-tuning towards adapting to new scenes,achieving competitive performance compared to per-scene optimized NeRF-basedmethods while significantly reducing computational costs.

While the globalattention mechanism offers high expressiveness, its excessive computationalcost restricts its applicability in various scenarios. In this paper, wepropose a novel attention paradigm, Agent Attention, to strike a favorablebalance between computational efficiency and representation power.Specifically, the Agent Attention, denoted as a quadruple $(Q, A, K, V)$,introduces an additional set of agent tokens $A$ into the conventionalattention module. The agent tokens first act as the agent for the query tokens$Q$ to aggregate information from $K$ and $V$, and then broadcast theinformation back to $Q$. Given the number of agent tokens can be designed to bemuch smaller than the number of query tokens, the agent attention issignificantly more efficient than the widely adopted Softmax attention, whilepreserving global context modelling capability. Interestingly, we show that theproposed agent attention is equivalent to a generalized form of linearattention. Therefore, agent attention seamlessly integrates the powerfulSoftmax attention and the highly efficient linear attention. Extensiveexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of agent attention with variousvision Transformers and across diverse vision tasks, including imageclassification, object detection, semantic segmentation and image generation.Notably, agent attention has shown remarkable performance in high-resolutionscenarios, owning to its linear attention nature. For instance, when applied toStable Diffusion, our agent attention accelerates generation and substantiallyenhances image generation quality without any additional training.

This simplified rendering approachpresents challenges in accurately modeling images captured under adverselighting conditions, such as low light or over-exposure. Motivated by theancient Greek emission theory that posits visual perception as a result of raysemanating from the eyes, we slightly refine the conventional NeRF framework totrain NeRF under challenging light conditions and generate normal-lightcondition novel views unsupervised. We introduce the concept of a "ConcealingField," which assigns transmittance values to the surrounding air to accountfor illumination effects. In dark scenarios, we assume that object emissionsmaintain a standard lighting level but are attenuated as they traverse the airduring the rendering process. Concealing Field thus compel NeRF to learnreasonable density and colour estimations for objects even in dimly litsituations. Similarly, the Concealing Field can mitigate over-exposed emissionsduring the rendering stage.

This paper proposes a novel coevolutionary algorithm (CoEvoRDT)designed to create robust DTs capable of handling noisy high-dimensional datain adversarial contexts. Motivated by the limitations of traditional DTalgorithms, we leverage adaptive coevolution to allow DTs to evolve and learnfrom interactions with perturbed input data. CoEvoRDT alternately evolvescompeting populations of DTs and perturbed features, enabling construction ofDTs with desired properties. CoEvoRDT is easily adaptable to various targetmetrics, allowing the use of tailored robustness criteria such as minimaxregret. Furthermore, CoEvoRDT has potential to improve the results of otherstate-of-the-art methods by incorporating their outcomes (DTs they produce)into the initial population and optimize them in the process of coevolution.Inspired by the game theory, CoEvoRDT utilizes mixed Nash equilibrium toenhance convergence. The method is tested on 20 popular datasets and showssuperior performance compared to 4 state-of-the-art algorithms. It outperformedall competing methods on 13 datasets with adversarial accuracy metrics, and onall 20 considered datasets with minimax regret.

However, existing approaches eitherfail to capture the fast-moving objects or need to build the scene graphwithout camera ego-motions, leading to low-quality synthesized views of thescene. We aim to jointly solve the view synthesis problem of large-scale urbanscenes and fast-moving vehicles, which is more practical and challenging. Tothis end, we first leverage a graph structure to learn the local scenerepresentations of dynamic objects and the background. Then, we design aprogressive scheme that dynamically allocates a new local scene graph trainedwith frames within a temporal window, allowing us to scale up therepresentation to an arbitrarily large scene. Besides, the training views ofurban scenes are relatively sparse, which leads to a significant decline inreconstruction accuracy for dynamic objects. Therefore, we design a frequencyauto-encoder network to encode the latent code and regularize the frequencyrange of objects, which can enhance the representation of dynamic objects andaddress the issue of sparse image inputs. Additionally, we employ lidar pointprojection to maintain geometry consistency in large-scale urban scenes.Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art viewsynthesis accuracy, object manipulation, and scene roaming ability.

Thekey feature in the RL-I2IT framework is to decompose a monolithic learningprocess into small steps with a lightweight model to progressively transform asource image successively to a target image. Considering that it is challengingto handle high dimensional continuous state and action spaces in theconventional RL framework, we introduce meta policy with a new concept Plan tothe standard Actor-Critic model, which is of a lower dimension than theoriginal image and can facilitate the actor to generate a tractable highdimensional action. In the RL-I2IT framework, we also employ a task-specificauxiliary learning strategy to stabilize the training process and improve theperformance of the corresponding task.

To mitigate this limitation, we present Holodeck, a systemthat generates 3D environments to match a user-supplied prompt fullyautomatedly. Holodeck can generate diverse scenes, e.g., arcades, spas, andmuseums, adjust the designs for styles, and can capture the semantics ofcomplex queries such as "apartment for a researcher with a cat" and "office ofa professor who is a fan of Star Wars". Holodeck leverages a large languagemodel (GPT-4) for common sense knowledge about what the scene might look likeand uses a large collection of 3D assets from Objaverse to populate the scenewith diverse objects. To address the challenge of positioning objectscorrectly, we prompt GPT-4 to generate spatial relational constraints betweenobjects and then optimize the layout to satisfy those constraints.

Previous studies suggest thatmoir\'e pattern elimination in the RAW domain offers greater efficiencycompared to demoir\'eing in the sRGB domain. Nevertheless, relying solely onraw data for image demoir\'eing is insufficient in mitigating color cast due tothe absence of essential information required for color correction by the ImageSignal Processor (ISP). In this paper, we propose perform Image Demoir\'eingconcurrently utilizing both RAW and sRGB data (RRID), which is readilyaccessible in both smartphones and digital cameras. We developSkip-Connection-based Demoir\'eing Module (SCDM) with specific modules embededin skip-connections for the efficient and effective demoir\'eing of RAW andsRGB features, respectively. Subsequently, we propose RGB Guided Image SignalProcessor (RGISP) to incorporate color information from coarsely demoir\'edsRGB features during the ISP stage, assisting the process of color recovery.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RRID outperforms state-of-the-artapproaches by 0.62dB in PSNR and 0.003 in SSIM, exhibiting superior performanceboth in moir\'e pattern removal and color cast correction.</description><author>Shuning Xu, Binbin Song, Xiangyu Chen, Jiantao Zhou</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 16:00:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09063v1</guid></item><item><title>Fair Clustering: A Causal Perspective</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09061v1</link><description>Clustering algorithms may unintentionally propagate or intensify existingdisparities, leading to unfair representations or biased decision-making.Current fair clustering methods rely on notions of fairness that do not captureany information on the underlying causal mechanisms.

This underscores thenecessity of efficient architecture search for designing better ViTsautomatically. As training-based architecture search methods arecomputationally intensive, there is a growing interest in training-free methodsthat use zero-cost proxies to score ViTs. However, existing training-freeapproaches require expert knowledge to manually design specific zero-costproxies. Moreover, these zero-cost proxies exhibit limitations to generalizeacross diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce Auto-Prox, an automaticproxy discovery framework, to address the problem. First, we build theViT-Bench-101, which involves different ViT candidates and their actualperformance on multiple datasets. Utilizing ViT-Bench-101, we can evaluatezero-cost proxies based on their score-accuracy correlation. Then, we representzero-cost proxies with computation graphs and organize the zero-cost proxysearch space with ViT statistics and primitive operations. To discover genericzero-cost proxies, we propose a joint correlation metric to evolve and mutatedifferent zero-cost proxy candidates. We introduce an elitism-preserve strategyfor search efficiency to achieve a better trade-off between exploitation andexploration. Based on the discovered zero-cost proxy, we conduct a ViTarchitecture search in a training-free manner. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate that our method generalizes well to different datasets and achievesstate-of-the-art results both in ranking correlation and final accuracy.

This work represents a solid step toward answering this critical question.Specifically, we define TRL, a unified framework that encompasses bothsupervised and contrastive backdoor attacks. Through the lens of TRL, weuncover that the two types of attacks operate through distinctive mechanisms:in supervised attacks, the learning of benign and backdoor tasks tends to occurindependently, while in contrastive attacks, the two tasks are deeplyintertwined both in their representations and throughout their learningprocesses. This distinction leads to the disparate learning dynamics andfeature distributions of supervised and contrastive attacks. More importantly,we reveal that the specificities of contrastive backdoor attacks entailimportant implications from a defense perspective: existing defenses forsupervised attacks are often inadequate and not easily retrofitted tocontrastive attacks. We also explore several alternative defenses and discusstheir potential challenges. Our findings highlight the need for defensestailored to the specificities of contrastive backdoor attacks, pointing topromising directions for future research.</description><author>Changjiang Li, Ren Pang, Bochuan Cao, Zhaohan Xi, Jinghui Chen, Shouling Ji, Ting Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 15:54:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09057v1</guid></item><item><title>ReCoRe: Regularized Contrastive Representation Learning of World Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09056v1</link><description>While recent model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have demonstratedhuman-level effectiveness in gaming environments, their success in everydaytasks like visual navigation has been limited, particularly under significantappearance variations. This limitation arises from (i) poor sample efficiencyand (ii) over-fitting to training scenarios. To address these challenges, wepresent a world model that learns invariant features using (i) contrastiveunsupervised learning and (ii) an intervention-invariant regularizer. Learningan explicit representation of the world dynamics i.e. a world model, improvessample efficiency while contrastive learning implicitly enforces learning ofinvariant features, which improves generalization. However, the naiveintegration of contrastive loss to world models fails due to a lack ofsupervisory signals to the visual encoder, as world-model-based RL methodsindependently optimize representation learning and agent policy. To overcomethis issue, we propose an intervention-invariant regularizer in the form of anauxiliary task such as depth prediction, image denoising, etc., that explicitlyenforces invariance to style-interventions. Our method outperforms currentstate-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL methods and significantly onout-of-distribution point navigation task evaluated on the iGibson benchmark.We further demonstrate that our approach, with only visual observations,outperforms recent language-guided foundation models for point navigation,which is essential for deployment on robots with limited computationcapabilities. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed model excels at thesim-to-real transfer of its perception module on Gibson benchmark.</description><author>Rudra P. K.

However, they face some challenges.First, few existing models consider the influence of auxiliary information,i.e., weather and holidays, which may result in a poor grasp ofspatial-temporal dynamics of traffic data. Second, both the construction of adynamic adjacent matrix and regular graph convolution operations have quadraticcomputation complexity, which restricts the scalability of GCN-based models. Toaddress such challenges, this work proposes a deep encoder-decoder modelentitled AIMSAN. It contains an auxiliary information-aware module (AIM) andsparse cross attention-based graph convolution network (SAN). The former learnsmulti-attribute auxiliary information and obtains its embedded presentation ofdifferent time-window sizes. The latter uses a cross-attention mechanism toconstruct dynamic adjacent matrices by fusing traffic data and embeddedauxiliary data. Then, SAN applies diffusion GCN on traffic data to mine richspatial-temporal dynamics. Furthermore, AIMSAN considers and uses the spatialsparseness of traffic nodes to reduce the quadratic computation complexity.Experimental results on three public traffic datasets demonstrate that theproposed method outperforms other counterparts in terms of various performanceindices. Specifically, the proposed method has competitive performance with thestate-of-the-art algorithms but saves 35.74% of GPU memory usage, 42.25% oftraining time, and 45.51% of validation time on average.</description><author>Lingqiang Chen, Qinglin Zhao, Guanghui Li, Mengchu Zhou, Chenglong Dai, Yiming Feng</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 15:48:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09050v1</guid></item><item><title>On The Expressivity of Recurrent Neural Cascades</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09048v1</link><description>Recurrent Neural Cascades (RNCs) are the recurrent neural networks with nocyclic dependencies among recurrent neurons. This class of recurrent networkshas received a lot of attention in practice. Besides training methods for afixed architecture such as backpropagation, the cascade architecture naturallyallows for constructive learning methods, where recurrent nodes are addedincrementally one at a time, often yielding smaller networks. Furthermore,acyclicity amounts to a structural prior that even for the same number ofneurons yields a more favourable sample complexity compared to afully-connected architecture. A central question is whether the advantages ofthe cascade architecture come at the cost of a reduced expressivity. We providenew insights into this question. We show that the regular languages captured byRNCs with sign and tanh activation with positive recurrent weights are thestar-free regular languages. In order to establish our results we developed anovel framework where capabilities of RNCs are accessed by analysing whichsemigroups and groups a single neuron is able to implement. A notableimplication of our framework is that RNCs can achieve the expressivity of allregular languages by introducing neurons that can implement groups.</description><author>Nadezda Alexandrovna Knorozova, Alessandro Ronca</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 15:47:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09048v1</guid></item><item><title>Exploring the Naturalness of AI-Generated Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05476v2</link><description>The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Images (AGIs) hasgreatly expanded the Image Naturalness Assessment (INA) problem. Different fromearly definitions that mainly focus on tone-mapped images with limiteddistortions (e.g., exposure, contrast, and color reproduction), INA onAI-generated images is especially challenging as it has more diverse contentsand could be affected by factors from multiple perspectives, includinglow-level technical distortions and high-level rationality distortions. In thispaper, we take the first step to benchmark and assess the visual naturalness ofAI-generated images. First, we construct the AI-Generated Image Naturalness(AGIN) database by conducting a large-scale subjective study to collect humanopinions on the overall naturalness as well as perceptions from technical andrationality perspectives. AGIN verifies that naturalness is universally anddisparately affected by both technical and rationality distortions. Second, wepropose the Joint Objective Image Naturalness evaluaTor (JOINT), toautomatically learn the naturalness of AGIs that aligns human ratings.Specifically, JOINT imitates human reasoning in naturalness evaluation byjointly learning both technical and rationality perspectives. Experimentalresults show our proposed JOINT significantly surpasses baselines for providingmore subjectively consistent results on naturalness assessment.

Whilethere exists a rich literature that studies classification and regression tasksusing solvable models of neural networks, seq2seq tasks have not yet beenstudied from this perspective. Here, we propose a simple model for a seq2seqtask that has the advantage of providing explicit control over the degree ofmemory, or non-Markovianity, in the sequences -- the stochasticswitching-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (SSOU) model. We introduce a measure ofnon-Markovianity to quantify the amount of memory in the sequences. For aminimal auto-regressive (AR) learning model trained on this task, we identifytwo learning regimes corresponding to distinct phases in the stationary stateof the SSOU process. These phases emerge from the interplay between twodifferent time scales that govern the sequence statistics. Moreover, we observethat while increasing the integration window of the AR model always improvesperformance, albeit with diminishing returns, increasing the non-Markovianityof the input sequences can improve or degrade its performance. Finally, weperform experiments with recurrent and convolutional neural networks that showthat our observations carry over to more complicated neural networkarchitectures.</description><author>Alireza Seif, Sarah A.

Despite the success, recent studies expose the vulnerabilityof FL to model inversion attacks, where adversaries reconstruct users privatedata via eavesdropping on the shared gradient information. We hypothesize thata key factor in the success of such attacks is the low entanglement amonggradients per data within the batch during stochastic optimization. Thiscreates a vulnerability that an adversary can exploit to reconstruct thesensitive data. Building upon this insight, we present a simple, yet effectivedefense strategy that obfuscates the gradients of the sensitive data withconcealed samples. To achieve this, we propose synthesizing concealed samplesto mimic the sensitive data at the gradient level while ensuring their visualdissimilarity from the actual sensitive data. Compared to the previous art, ourempirical evaluations suggest that the proposed technique provides thestrongest protection while simultaneously maintaining the FL performance.</description><author>Jing Wu, Munawar Hayat, Mingyi Zhou, Mehrtash Harandi</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 15:42:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05724v2</guid></item><item><title>Topic Bias in Emotion Classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09043v1</link><description>Emotion corpora are typically sampled based on keyword/hashtag search or byasking study participants to generate textual instances. In any case, thesecorpora are not uniform samples representing the entirety of a domain. Wehypothesize that this practice of data acquisition leads to unrealisticcorrelations between overrepresented topics in these corpora that harm thegeneralizability of models. Such topic bias could lead to wrong predictions forinstances like "I organized the service for my aunt's funeral." when funeralevents are over-represented for instances labeled with sadness, despite theemotion of pride being more appropriate here. In this paper, we study thistopic bias both from the data and the modeling perspective. We first label aset of emotion corpora automatically via topic modeling and show that emotionsin fact correlate with specific topics. Further, we see that emotionclassifiers are confounded by such topics. Finally, we show that theestablished debiasing method of adversarial correction via gradient reversalmitigates the issue.

Despite the success, existing spectral GNNs usually fail to deal withcomplex networks (e.g., WWW) due to such homogeneous spectral filtering settingthat ignores the regional heterogeneity as typically seen in real-worldnetworks. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel diverse spectral filtering(DSF) framework, which automatically learns node-specific filter weights toexploit the varying local structure properly. Particularly, the diverse filterweights consist of two components -- A global one shared among all nodes, and alocal one that varies along network edges to reflect node difference arisingfrom distinct graph parts -- to balance between local and global information.As such, not only can the global graph characteristics be captured, but alsothe diverse local patterns can be mined with awareness of different nodepositions. Interestingly, we formulate a novel optimization problem to assistin learning diverse filters, which also enables us to enhance any spectral GNNswith our DSF framework. We showcase the proposed framework on threestate-of-the-arts including GPR-GNN, BernNet, and JacobiConv. Extensiveexperiments over 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework canconsistently boost model performance by up to 4.92% in node classificationtasks, producing diverse filters with enhanced interpretability.

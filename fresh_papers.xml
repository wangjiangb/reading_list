Existing researcheither neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading tosuboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models(LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, weintroduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework forempathetic response generation. This framework incorporates emotion contagionto augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask topinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intentmimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. Byharnessing an intent twice reflect the mechanism ofExploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotionaldecision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empatheticresponse misalignments stemming from emotional misrecognition. Throughreflection, the framework maps emotional states to intents, markedly enhancingboth response empathy and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments reveal thatReflectDiffu outperforms existing models regarding relevance, controllability,and informativeness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both automatic andhuman evaluations.</description><author>Jiahao Yuan, Zixiang Di, Zhiqing Cui, Guisong Yang, Usman Naseem</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 17:30:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10289v2</guid></item><item><title>Contextual Breach: Assessing the Robustness of Transformer-based QA Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10997v2</link><description>Contextual question-answering models are susceptible to adversarialperturbations to input context, commonly observed in real-world scenarios.These adversarial noises are designed to degrade the performance of the modelby distorting the textual input.

However, present methodology relies on algorithms thatseparate document and word representations. This prevents the creation of ameaningful embedding space where changes in word usage and documents can bedirectly analyzed in a temporal context. This paper proposes an expansion ofthe compass-aligned temporal Word2Vec methodology into dynamic topic modeling.Such a method allows for the direct comparison of word and document embeddingsacross time in dynamic topics. This enables the creation of visualizations thatincorporate temporal word embeddings within the context of documents into topicvisualizations. In experiments against the current state-of-the-art, ourproposed method demonstrates overall competitive performance in topic relevancyand diversity across temporal datasets of varying size. Simultaneously, itprovides insightful visualizations focused on temporal word embeddings whilemaintaining the insights provided by global topic evolution, advancing ourunderstanding of how topics evolve over time.</description><author>Daniel Palamarchuk, Lemara Williams, Brian Mayer, Thomas Danielson, Rebecca Faust, Larry Deschaine, Chris North</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 15:48:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10649v2</guid></item><item><title>Operational Wind Speed Forecasts for Chile's Electric Power Sector Using a Hybrid ML Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09263v3</link><description>As Chile's electric power sector advances toward a future powered byrenewable energy, accurate forecasting of renewable generation is essential formanaging grid operations. The integration of renewable energy sources isparticularly challenging due to the operational difficulties of managing theirpower generation, which is highly variable compared to fossil fuel sources,delaying the availability of clean energy. To mitigate this, we quantify theimpact of increasing intermittent generation from wind and solar on thermalpower plants in Chile and introduce a hybrid wind speed forecasting methodologywhich combines two custom ML models for Chile. The first model is based onTiDE, an MLP-based ML model for short-term forecasts, and the second is basedon a graph neural network, GraphCast, for medium-term forecasts up to 10 days.Our hybrid approach outperforms the most accurate operational deterministicsystems by 4-21% for short-term forecasts and 5-23% for medium-term forecastsand can directly lower the impact of wind generation on thermal ramping,curtailment, and system-level emissions in Chile.</description><author>Dhruv Suri, Praneet Dutta, Flora Xue, Ines Azevedo, Ravi Jain</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 15:17:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09263v3</guid></item><item><title>LOLA -- An Open-Source Massively Multilingual Large Language Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11272v2</link><description>This paper presents LOLA, a massively multilingual large language modeltrained on more than 160 languages using a sparse Mixture-of-ExpertsTransformer architecture.

Thisapproach develops shared representations and learns correlations betweenmodalities, enabling applications such as visual question answering andaudiovisual content analysis. Current techniques rely on largemodality-specific encoders, necessitating fine-tuning or training from scratchon vast aligned datasets (e.g., text-image, text-audio, image-audio). Thisapproach has limitations: (i) it is very expensive due to the need for traininglarge encoders on extensive datasets, (ii) acquiring aligned large paireddatasets is challenging, and (iii) adding new modalities requires retrainingthe entire framework to incorporate these modalities. To address these issues,we propose OneEncoder, a lightweight framework that progressively representsand aligns four modalities (image, text, audio, video). Initially, we train alightweight Universal Projection module (UP) to align image and textmodalities. Then, we freeze the pretrained UP and progressively align futuremodalities to those already aligned. OneEncoder operates efficiently andcost-effectively, even in scenarios where vast aligned datasets areunavailable, due to its lightweight design. Trained on small paired datasets,it shows strong performance in tasks like classification, querying, and visualquestion answering, surpassing methods that rely on large datasets andspecialized encoders.</description><author>Bilal Faye, Hanane Azzag, Mustapha Lebbah</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 13:27:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11059v2</guid></item><item><title>RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector Retrieval</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v2</link><description>Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasinglyimportant. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attentioncomputation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inferencelatency and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors.This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to bothaccelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. Byleveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttentionproposes to use approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KVvectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones with vector searchduring generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNSindexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to theout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in attentionmechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing anattention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution ofquery vectors. Our evaluation shows that RetrievalAttention only needs toaccess 1--3% of data while maintaining high model accuracy. This leads tosignificant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs with muchlower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs asingle NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8Bparameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.</description><author>Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 13:11:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v2</guid></item><item><title>Mamba-YOLO-World: Marrying YOLO-World with Mamba for Open-Vocabulary Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08513v3</link><description>Open-vocabulary detection (OVD) aims to detect objects beyond a predefinedset of categories. As a pioneering model incorporating the YOLO series intoOVD, YOLO-World is well-suited for scenarios prioritizing speed and efficiency.However, its performance is hindered by its neck feature fusion mechanism,which causes the quadratic complexity and the limited guided receptive fields.To address these limitations, we present Mamba-YOLO-World, a novel YOLO-basedOVD model employing the proposed MambaFusion Path Aggregation Network(MambaFusion-PAN) as its neck architecture. Specifically, we introduce aninnovative State Space Model-based feature fusion mechanism consisting of aParallel-Guided Selective Scan algorithm and a Serial-Guided Selective Scanalgorithm with linear complexity and globally guided receptive fields. Itleverages multi-modal input sequences and mamba hidden states to guide theselective scanning process. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperformsthe original YOLO-World on the COCO and LVIS benchmarks in both zero-shot andfine-tuning settings while maintaining comparable parameters and FLOPs.Additionally, it surpasses existing state-of-the-art OVD methods with fewerparameters and FLOPs.</description><author>Haoxuan Wang, Qingdong He, Jinlong Peng, Hao Yang, Mingmin Chi, Yabiao Wang</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 12:30:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08513v3</guid></item><item><title>GEIC: Universal and Multilingual Named Entity Recognition with Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11022v2</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have supplanted traditional methods in numerousnatural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, in Named Entity Recognition(NER), existing LLM-based methods underperform compared to baselines andrequire significantly more computational resources, limiting their application.In this paper, we introduce the task of generation-based extraction andin-context classification (GEIC), designed to leverage LLMs' prior knowledgeand self-attention mechanisms for NER tasks. We then propose CascadeNER, auniversal and multilingual GEIC framework for few-shot and zero-shot NER.CascadeNER employs model cascading to utilize two small-parameter LLMs toextract and classify independently, reducing resource consumption whileenhancing accuracy. We also introduce AnythingNER, the first NER datasetspecifically designed for LLMs, including 8 languages, 155 entity types and anovel dynamic categorization system. Experiments show that CascadeNER achievesstate-of-the-art performance on low-resource and fine-grained scenarios,including CrossNER and FewNERD.

A key challenge is generating a diverse set of futurepredictions, commonly addressed using data-driven models with Multiple ChoiceLearning (MCL) architectures and Winner-Takes-All (WTA) training objectives.However, these methods face initialization sensitivity and traininginstabilities. Additionally, to compensate for limited performance, someapproaches rely on training with a large set of hypotheses, requiring apost-selection step during inference to significantly reduce the number ofpredictions. To tackle these issues, we take inspiration from annealed MCL, arecently introduced technique that improves the convergence properties of MCLmethods through an annealed Winner-Takes-All loss (aWTA). In this paper, wedemonstrate how the aWTA loss can be integrated with state-of-the-art motionforecasting models to enhance their performance using only a minimal set ofhypotheses, eliminating the need for the cumbersome post-selection step. Ourapproach can be easily incorporated into any trajectory prediction modelnormally trained using WTA and yields significant improvements.

Although machine learning-basedprediction methods $\Delta\Delta G$ are suitable for large-scale mutantscreening, they struggle to predict the effects of multiple mutations fortargets without existing binders. Energy function-based methods, though moreaccurate, are time consuming and not ideal for large-scale screening. Toaddress this, we propose an active learning workflow that efficiently trains adeep learning model to learn energy functions for specific targets, combiningthe advantages of both approaches. Our method integrates the RDE-Network deeplearning model with Rosetta's energy function-based Flex ddG to efficientlyexplore mutants. In a case study targeting HER2-binding Trastuzumab mutants,our approach significantly improved the screening performance over randomselection and demonstrated the ability to identify mutants with better bindingproperties without experimental $\Delta\Delta G$ data. This workflow advancescomputational antibody design by combining machine learning, physics-basedcomputations, and active learning to achieve more efficient antibodydevelopment.</description><author>Kairi Furui, Masahito Ohue</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:37:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10964v2</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Fine-tuned Generative Models for Keyphrase Selection: A Case Study for Russian</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10640v2</link><description>Keyphrase selection plays a pivotal role within the domain of scholarlytexts, facilitating efficient information retrieval, summarization, andindexing. In this work, we explored how to apply fine-tuned generativetransformer-based models to the specific task of keyphrase selection withinRussian scientific texts. We experimented with four distinct generative models,such as ruT5, ruGPT, mT5, and mBART, and evaluated their performance in bothin-domain and cross-domain settings. The experiments were conducted on thetexts of Russian scientific abstracts from four domains: mathematics &amp; computerscience, history, medicine, and linguistics. The use of generative models,namely mBART, led to gains in in-domain performance (up to 4.9% in BERTScore,9.0% in ROUGE-1, and 12.2% in F1-score) over three keyphrase extractionbaselines for the Russian language. Although the results for cross-domain usagewere significantly lower, they still demonstrated the capability to surpassbaseline performances in several cases, underscoring the promising potentialfor further exploration and refinement in this research field.</description><author>Anna Glazkova, Dmitry Morozov</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:35:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10640v2</guid></item><item><title>Performance of Cross-Validated Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11265v2</link><description>Background: Advanced methods for causal inference, such as targeted maximumlikelihood estimation (TMLE), require certain conditions for statisticalinference. However, in situations where there is not differentiability due todata sparsity or near-positivity violations, the Donsker class condition isviolated. In such situations, TMLE variance can suffer from inflation of thetype I error and poor coverage, leading to conservative confidence intervals.Cross-validation of the TMLE algorithm (CVTMLE) has been suggested to improveon performance compared to TMLE in settings of positivity or Donsker classviolations. We aim to investigate the performance of CVTMLE compared to TMLE invarious settings. Methods: We utilised the data-generating mechanism as described in Leger etal. (2022) to run a Monte Carlo experiment under different Donsker classviolations. Then, we evaluated the respective statistical performances of TMLEand CVTMLE with different super learner libraries, with and without regressiontree methods. Results: We found that CVTMLE vastly improves confidence interval coveragewithout adversely affecting bias, particularly in settings with small samplesizes and near-positivity violations. Furthermore, incorporating regressiontrees using standard TMLE with ensemble super learner-based initial estimatesincreases bias and variance leading to invalid statistical inference. Conclusions: It has been shown that when using CVTMLE the Donsker classcondition is no longer necessary to obtain valid statistical inference whenusing regression trees and under either data sparsity or near-positivityviolations. We show through simulations that CVTMLE is much less sensitive tothe choice of the super learner library and thereby provides better estimationand inference in cases where the super learner library uses more flexiblecandidates and is prone to overfitting.</description><author>Matthew J.

However, fine-tuningthese models for specific tasks remains computationally expensive and risksdegrading pre-learned features. To address these challenges, we proposePropulsion, a novel parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method designed tooptimize task-specific performance while drastically reducing computationaloverhead. Inspired by the concept of controlled adjustments in physical motion,Propulsion selectively re-scales specific dimensions of a pre-trained model,guiding output predictions toward task objectives without modifying the model'sparameters. By introducing lightweight, trainable Propulsion parameters at thepre-trained layer, we minimize the number of parameters updated duringfine-tuning, preventing overfitting or overwriting of existing knowledge. Ourtheoretical analysis, supported by Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, showsthat Propulsion approximates the performance of full fine-tuning with far fewertrainable parameters. Empirically, Propulsion reduces the parameter count from355.3 million to just 0.086 million, achieving over a 10x reduction compared tostandard approaches like LoRA while maintaining competitive performance acrossbenchmarks.</description><author>Md Kowsher, Nusrat Jahan Prottasha, Prakash Bhat</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:23:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10927v2</guid></item><item><title>Towards No-Code Programming of Cobots: Experiments with Code Synthesis by Large Code Models for Conversational Programming</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11041v2</link><description>While there has been a lot of research recently on robots in householdenvironments, at the present time, most robots in existence can be found onshop floors, and most interactions between humans and robots happen there.``Collaborative robots'' (cobots) designed to work alongside humans on assemblylines traditionally require expert programming, limiting ability to makechanges, or manual guidance, limiting expressivity of the resulting programs.To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs),and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, forconversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundationfor simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer'instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to bebuilt; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. Wecreate a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions(human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. Withthis, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs forsynthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in asimulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate`first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing`higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops).</description><author>Chalamalasetti Kranti, Sherzod Hakimov, David Schlangen</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 07:17:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11041v2</guid></item><item><title>Zero-resource Hallucination Detection for Text Generation via Graph-based Contextual Knowledge Triples Modeling</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11283v2</link><description>LLMs obtain remarkable performance but suffer from hallucinations. Mostresearch on detecting hallucination focuses on the questions with short andconcrete correct answers that are easy to check the faithfulness. Hallucinationdetections for text generation with open-ended answers are more challenging.Some researchers use external knowledge to detect hallucinations in generatedtexts, but external resources for specific scenarios are hard to access. Recentstudies on detecting hallucinations in long text without external resourcesconduct consistency comparison among multiple sampled outputs. To handle longtexts, researchers split long texts into multiple facts and individuallycompare the consistency of each pairs of facts. However, these methods (1)hardly achieve alignment among multiple facts; (2) overlook dependenciesbetween multiple contextual facts. In this paper, we propose a graph-basedcontext-aware (GCA) hallucination detection for text generations, which alignsknowledge facts and considers the dependencies between contextual knowledgetriples in consistency comparison. Particularly, to align multiple facts, weconduct a triple-oriented response segmentation to extract multiple knowledgetriples. To model dependencies among contextual knowledge triple (facts), weconstruct contextual triple into a graph and enhance triples' interactions viamessage passing and aggregating via RGCN. To avoid the omission of knowledgetriples in long text, we conduct a LLM-based reverse verification viareconstructing the knowledge triples. Experiments show that our model enhanceshallucination detection and excels all baselines.</description><author>Xinyue Fang, Zhen Huang, Zhiliang Tian, Minghui Fang, Ziyi Pan, Quntian Fang, Zhihua Wen, Hengyue Pan, Dongsheng Li</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 05:42:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11283v2</guid></item><item><title>MURRE: Multi-Hop Table Retrieval with Removal for Open-Domain Text-to-SQL</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10666v5</link><description>The open-domain text-to-SQL task aims to retrieve question-relevant tablesfrom massive databases and generate SQL.

Existing approaches, including principlism (reliance on abstractethical principles), formalism (rigid application of rules), and technicalsolutionism (overemphasis on technological fixes), offer little practicalguidance for addressing ethical challenges of AI in scientific researchpractices. To bridge the gap between abstract principles and day-to-dayresearch practices, a user-centered, realism-inspired approach is proposedhere. It outlines five specific goals for ethical AI use: 1) understandingmodel training and output, including bias mitigation strategies; 2) respectingprivacy, confidentiality, and copyright; 3) avoiding plagiarism and policyviolations; 4) applying AI beneficially compared to alternatives; and 5) usingAI transparently and reproducibly. Each goal is accompanied by actionablestrategies and realistic cases of misuse and corrective measures. I argue thatethical AI application requires evaluating its utility against existingalternatives rather than isolated performance metrics. Additionally, I proposedocumentation guidelines to enhance transparency and reproducibility inAI-assisted research.

Our model integratesthree key components: 1) meta-ControlNet that dynamically modulates theconditioning strength, 2) dynamic reference routing that mitigates misalignmentbetween the input image and 3D reference, and 3) self-reference augmentationsthat enable self-supervised training with a progressive curriculum.Collectively, these designs result in a clear improvement over existingmethods.

Remarkably, NVLM 1.0 shows improvedtext-only performance over its LLM backbone after multimodal training. In termsof model design, we perform a comprehensive comparison between decoder-onlymultimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA) and cross-attention-based models (e.g.,Flamingo). Based on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we proposea novel architecture that enhances both training efficiency and multimodalreasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a 1-D tile-tagging design fortile-based dynamic high-resolution images, which significantly boostsperformance on multimodal reasoning and OCR-related tasks. Regarding trainingdata, we meticulously curate and provide detailed information on our multimodalpretraining and supervised fine-tuning datasets. Our findings indicate thatdataset quality and task diversity are more important than scale, even duringthe pretraining phase, across all architectures. Notably, we developproduction-grade multimodality for the NVLM-1.0 models, enabling them to excelin vision-language tasks while maintaining and even improving text-onlyperformance compared to their LLM backbones. To achieve this, we craft andintegrate a high-quality text-only dataset into multimodal training, alongsidea substantial amount of multimodal math and reasoning data, leading to enhancedmath and coding capabilities across modalities.

However, theconjunction of these technologies and the proposed enhancements in severalstate-of-the-art works followed a non-unified software architecture resultingin a lack of modularity. Indeed, they focused mainly on functionalities andoverlooked the definition of the component's boundaries within the agent. Thiscaused terminological and architectural ambiguities between researchers whichwe addressed in this paper by proposing a unified framework that establishes aclear foundation for LLM-based agents' development from both functional andsoftware architectural perspectives. Our framework, LLM-Agent-UMF (LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework),clearly distinguishes between the different components of an agent, settingLLMs, and tools apart from a newly introduced element: the core-agent, playingthe role of the central coordinator of the agent which comprises five modules:planning, memory, profile, action, and security, the latter often neglected inprevious works. Differences in the internal structure of core-agents led us toclassify them into a taxonomy of passive and active types. Based on this, weproposed different multi-core agent architectures combining uniquecharacteristics of various individual agents. For evaluation purposes, we applied this framework to a selection ofstate-of-the-art agents, thereby demonstrating its alignment with theirfunctionalities and clarifying the overlooked architectural aspects. Moreover,we thoroughly assessed four of our proposed architectures by integratingdistinctive agents into hybrid active/passive core-agents' systems. Thisanalysis provided clear insights into potential improvements and highlightedthe challenges involved in the combination of specific agents.</description><author>Amine B.

The selection ofan appropriate normalization method needs to take into account the type andcharacteristics of the involved features, the methods to be used subsequentlyfor the just mentioned data processing, as well as the specific questions beingconsidered. After briefly considering how normalization constitutes one of themany interrelated parts typically involved in data analysis and modeling, thepresent work addressed the important issue of feature normalization from theperspective of uniform and proportional (right skewed) features and comparisonoperations. More general right skewed features are also considered in anapproximated manner. Several concepts, properties, and results are describedand discussed, including the description of a duality relationship betweenuniform and proportional feature spaces and respective comparisons, specifyingconditions for consistency between comparisons in each of the two domains. Twonormalization possibilities based on non-centralized dispersion of features arealso presented, and also described is a modified version of the Jaccardsimilarity index which incorporates intrinsically normalization.

ICL promisesto "adapt" the LLM to perform the present task at a competitive orstate-of-the-art level at a fraction of the computational cost. ICL can beaugmented by incorporating the reasoning process to arrive at the final labelexplicitly in the prompt, a technique called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.However, recent work has found that ICL relies mostly on the retrieval of taskpriors and less so on "learning" to perform tasks, especially for complexsubjective domains like emotion and morality, where priors ossify posteriorpredictions. In this work, we examine whether "enabling" reasoning also createsthe same behavior in LLMs, wherein the format of CoT retrieves reasoning priorsthat remain relatively unchanged despite the evidence in the prompt. We findthat, surprisingly, CoT indeed suffers from the same posterior collapse as ICLfor larger language models.

Motivated by recent advances with Selective State SpacesModels (SSMs), we propose a method, referred to as Wave-U-Mamba that directlyperforms SSR in time domain. In our comparative study, including models such asWSRGlow, NU-Wave 2, and AudioSR, Wave-U-Mamba demonstrates superiorperformance, achieving the lowest Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) across variouslow-resolution sampling rates, ranging from 8 kHz to 24 kHz. Additionally,subjective human evaluations, scored using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) reveal thatour method produces SSR with natural and human-like quality.

However, the quadratic complexity of Attention makes thevanilla Attention based models hard to apply to long sequence tasks. Variousimproved Attention structures are proposed to reduce the computation cost byinducing low rankness and approximating the whole sequence by sub-sequences.The most challenging part of those approaches is maintaining the proper balancebetween information preservation and computation reduction: the longersub-sequences used, the better information is preserved, but at the price ofintroducing more noise and computational costs. In this paper, we propose asmoothed skeleton sketching based Attention structure, coined S$^3$Attention,which significantly improves upon the previous attempts to negotiate thistrade-off. S$^3$Attention has two mechanisms to effectively minimize the impactof noise while keeping the linear complexity to the sequence length: asmoothing block to mix information over long sequences and a matrix sketchingmethod that simultaneously selects columns and rows from the input matrix. Weverify the effectiveness of S$^3$Attention both theoretically and empirically.Extensive studies over Long Range Arena (LRA) datasets and six time-seriesforecasting show that S$^3$Attention significantly outperforms both vanillaAttention and other state-of-the-art variants of Attention structures.</description><author>Xue Wang, Tian Zhou, Jianqing Zhu, Jialin Liu, Kun Yuan, Tao Yao, Wotao Yin, Rong Jin, HanQin Cai</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 17:30:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08567v3</guid></item><item><title>Ultrasound Image Enhancement with the Variance of Diffusion Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11380v1</link><description>Ultrasound imaging, despite its widespread use in medicine, often suffersfrom various sources of noise and artifacts that impact the signal-to-noiseratio and overall image quality.

Suchinformation is crucial for applications where the LLM must provide up to dateinformation. However, this statement only scratches the surface: do allresources in the training data share the same knowledge cutoff date? Does themodel's demonstrated knowledge for these subsets closely align to their cutoffdates? In this work, we define the notion of an effective cutoff. This isdistinct from the LLM designer reported cutoff and applies separately tosub-resources and topics. We propose a simple approach to estimate effectivecutoffs on the resource-level temporal alignment of an LLM by probing acrossversions of the data. Using this analysis, we find that effective cutoffs oftendiffer from reported cutoffs. To understand the root cause of this observation,we conduct a direct large-scale analysis on open pre-training datasets. Ouranalysis reveals two reasons for these inconsistencies: (1) temporal biases ofCommonCrawl data due to non-trivial amounts of old data in new dumps and (2)complications in LLM deduplication schemes involving semantic duplicates andlexical near-duplicates. Overall, our results show that knowledge cutoffs arenot as simple as they have seemed and that care must be taken both by LLMdataset curators as well as practitioners who seek to use information fromthese models.</description><author>Jeffrey Cheng, Marc Marone, Orion Weller, Dawn Lawrie, Daniel Khashabi, Benjamin Van Durme</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 17:25:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12958v2</guid></item><item><title>Diversify and Conquer: Diversity-Centric Data Selection with Iterative Refinement</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11378v1</link><description>Finetuning large language models on instruction data is crucial for enhancingpre-trained knowledge and improving instruction-following capabilities. Asinstruction datasets proliferate, selecting optimal data for effective trainingbecomes increasingly important. This work addresses the question: How can wedetermine the optimal subset of data for effective training? While existingresearch often emphasizes local criteria like instance quality for subsetselection, we argue that a global approach focused on data diversity is morecritical. Our method employs k-means clustering to ensure the selected subseteffectively represents the full dataset. We propose an iterative refinementmethod inspired by active learning techniques to resample instances fromclusters, reassessing each cluster's importance and sampling weight in everytraining iteration. This approach reduces the effect of outliers andautomatically filters out clusters containing low-quality data. Throughextensive evaluation across natural language reasoning, general worldknowledge, code and math reasoning tasks, and by fine-tuning models fromvarious families, we observe consistent improvements, achieving a 7% increaseover random selection and a 3.8% improvement over state-of-the-art samplingmethods.

For a machine to havethe same degree of comprehension, the machine must know what a lion is(semantic attribute), what the concept of "behind" is (spatial attribute) andhow these pieces of linguistic information align with the semantic and spatialattributes of the sound (what a roar sounds like when its coming from behind).State-of-the-art audio foundation models which learn to map between audioscenes and natural textual descriptions, are trained on non-spatial audio andtext pairs, and hence lack spatial awareness. In contrast, sound eventlocalization and detection models are limited to recognizing sounds from afixed number of classes, and they localize the source to absolute position(e.g., 0.2m) rather than a position described using natural language (e.g.,"next to me"). To address these gaps, we present ELSA a spatially aware-audioand text embedding model trained using multimodal contrastive learning. ELSAsupports non-spatial audio, spatial audio, and open vocabulary text captionsdescribing both the spatial and semantic components of sound. To train ELSA:(a) we spatially augment the audio and captions of three open-source audiodatasets totaling 4,738 hours of audio, and (b) we design an encoder to capturethe semantics of non-spatial audio, and the semantics and spatial attributes ofspatial audio using contrastive learning. ELSA is competitive withstate-of-the-art for both semantic retrieval and 3D source localization. Inparticular, ELSA achieves +2.8% mean audio-to-text and text-to-audio R@1 abovethe baseline, and outperforms by -11.6{\deg} mean-absolute-error in 3D sourcelocalization over the baseline.</description><author>Bhavika Devnani, Skyler Seto, Zakaria Aldeneh, Alessandro Toso, Elena Menyaylenko, Barry-John Theobald, Jonathan Sheaffer, Miguel Sarabia</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 17:17:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11369v1</guid></item><item><title>OSV: One Step is Enough for High-Quality Image to Video Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11367v1</link><description>Video diffusion models have shown great potential in generating high-qualityvideos, making them an increasingly popular focus. However, their inherentiterative nature leads to substantial computational and time costs. Whileefforts have been made to accelerate video diffusion by reducing inferencesteps (through techniques like consistency distillation) and GAN training(these approaches often fall short in either performance or trainingstability). In this work, we introduce a two-stage training framework thateffectively combines consistency distillation with GAN training to addressthese challenges. Additionally, we propose a novel video discriminator design,which eliminates the need for decoding the video latents and improves the finalperformance. Our model is capable of producing high-quality videos in merelyone-step, with the flexibility to perform multi-step refinement for furtherperformance enhancement. Our quantitative evaluation on the OpenWebVid-1Mbenchmark shows that our model significantly outperforms existing methods.Notably, our 1-step performance(FVD 171.15) exceeds the 8-step performance ofthe consistency distillation based method, AnimateLCM (FVD 184.79), andapproaches the 25-step performance of advanced Stable Video Diffusion (FVD156.94).</description><author>Xiaofeng Mao, Zhengkai Jiang, Fu-Yun Wang, Wenbing Zhu, Jiangning Zhang, Hao Chen, Mingmin Chi, Yabiao Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 17:16:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11367v1</guid></item><item><title>Towards Optimal Branching of Linear and Semidefinite Relaxations for Neural Network Robustness Certification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09306v3</link><description>In this paper, we study certifying the robustness of ReLU neural networksagainst adversarial input perturbations. To diminish the relaxation errorsuffered by the popular linear programming (LP) and semidefinite programming(SDP) certification methods, we take a branch-and-bound approach to proposepartitioning the input uncertainty set and solving the relaxations on each partseparately. We show that this approach reduces relaxation error, and that theerror is eliminated entirely upon performing an LP relaxation with a partitionintelligently designed to exploit the nature of the ReLU activations. To scalethis approach to large networks, we consider using a coarser partition wherebythe number of parts in the partition is reduced. We prove that computing such acoarse partition that directly minimizes the LP relaxation error is NP-hard. Byinstead minimizing the worst-case LP relaxation error, we develop a closed-formbranching scheme in the single-hidden layer case. We extend the analysis to theSDP, where the feasible set geometry is exploited to design a branching schemethat minimizes the worst-case SDP relaxation error. Experiments on MNIST,CIFAR-10, and Wisconsin breast cancer diagnosis classifiers demonstratesignificant increases in the percentages of test samples certified. Byindependently increasing the input size and the number of layers, weempirically illustrate under which regimes the branched LP and branched SDP arebest applied. Finally, we extend our LP branching method into a multi-layerbranching heuristic, which attains comparable performance to priorstate-of-the-art heuristics on large-scale, deep neural network certificationbenchmarks.</description><author>Brendon G.

Those MLLMs aretypically built based on the LLMs, with an image encoder to process images intothe token embedding space of the LLMs. However, the integration of visualmodality has introduced a unique vulnerability: the MLLM becomes susceptible tomalicious visual inputs and prone to generating sensitive or harmful responses,even though the LLM has been trained on textual dataset to align with humanvalue. In this paper, we first raise the question: ``Do the MLLMs possesssafety-awareness against malicious image inputs?". We find that after adding aprinciple that specifies the safety requirement into the input of the MLLM, themodel's safety awareness becomes boosted. This phenomenon verifies theexistence of MLLM's safety-awareness against image inputs, it is only weakenedby the modality gap. We then introduce a simple yet effective technique termedCoCA, which amplifies the safety-awareness of the MLLM by calibrating itsoutput distribution. Our proposed strategy helps the model reclaim its originalsafety awareness without losing its original capabilities. We verify theeffectiveness of our approach on both multimodal safety and understandingbenchmarks.</description><author>Jiahui Gao, Renjie Pi, Tianyang Han, Han Wu, Lanqing Hong, Lingpeng Kong, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 17:14:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11365v1</guid></item><item><title>SpatialBot: Precise Spatial Understanding with Vision Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13642v6</link><description>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in 2Dimage understanding, however they are still struggling with spatialunderstanding which is the foundation of Embodied AI.

To spur the development ofuseful agents, we need benchmarks that are challenging, but more crucially,directly correspond to real-world tasks of interest. This paper introduces sucha benchmark, designed to measure the accuracy of AI agents in tackling acrucial yet surprisingly challenging aspect of scientific research:computational reproducibility. This task, fundamental to the scientificprocess, involves reproducing the results of a study using the provided codeand data. We introduce CORE-Bench (Computational Reproducibility AgentBenchmark), a benchmark consisting of 270 tasks based on 90 scientific papersacross three disciplines (computer science, social science, and medicine).Tasks in CORE-Bench consist of three difficulty levels and include bothlanguage-only and vision-language tasks. We provide an evaluation system tomeasure the accuracy of agents in a fast and parallelizable way, saving days ofevaluation time for each run compared to a sequential implementation. Weevaluated two baseline agents: the general-purpose AutoGPT and a task-specificagent called CORE-Agent. We tested both variants using two underlying languagemodels: GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. The best agent achieved an accuracy of 21% onthe hardest task, showing the vast scope for improvement in automating routinescientific tasks. Having agents that can reproduce existing work is a necessarystep towards building agents that can conduct novel research and could verifyand improve the performance of other research agents. We hope that CORE-Benchcan improve the state of reproducibility and spur the development of futureresearch agents.</description><author>Zachary S.

Conditioned on a question and answer-key, does themost likely token match the ground truth? Such benchmarks necessarily fail toevaluate language models' ability to quantify outcome uncertainty. In thiswork, we focus on the use of language models as risk scores for unrealizableprediction tasks. We introduce folktexts, a software package to systematicallygenerate risk scores using language models, and evaluate them against US Censusdata products. A flexible API enables the use of different prompting schemes,local or web-hosted models, and diverse census columns that can be used tocompose custom prediction tasks. We demonstrate the utility of folktextsthrough a sweep of empirical insights into the statistical properties of 17recent large language models across five natural text benchmark tasks. We findthat zero-shot risk scores produced by multiple-choice question-answering havehigh predictive signal but are widely miscalibrated. Base models consistentlyoverestimate outcome uncertainty, while instruction-tuned models underestimateuncertainty and produce over-confident risk scores. In fact, instruction-tuningpolarizes answer distribution regardless of true underlying data uncertainty.Conversely, verbally querying models for probability estimates results insubstantially improved calibration across all instruction-tuned models. Thesedifferences in ability to quantify data uncertainty cannot be revealed inrealizable settings, and highlight a blind-spot in the current evaluationecosystem that \folktexts covers.</description><author>AndrÃ© F.

Existing detection and mitigationmethods are often isolated and insufficient for domain-specific needs, lackinga standardized pipeline. This paper introduces THaMES (Tool for HallucinationMitigations and EvaluationS), an integrated framework and library addressingthis gap. THaMES offers an end-to-end solution for evaluating and mitigatinghallucinations in LLMs, featuring automated test set generation, multifacetedbenchmarking, and adaptable mitigation strategies. It automates test setcreation from any corpus, ensuring high data quality, diversity, andcost-efficiency through techniques like batch processing, weighted sampling,and counterfactual validation. THaMES assesses a model's ability to detect andreduce hallucinations across various tasks, including text generation andbinary classification, applying optimal mitigation strategies like In-ContextLearning (ICL), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and Parameter-EfficientFine-tuning (PEFT). Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs using a knowledge baseof academic papers, political news, and Wikipedia reveal that commercial modelslike GPT-4o benefit more from RAG than ICL, while open-weight models likeLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo gain more from ICL.

Unlike popular diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), OmniGenno longer requires additional modules such as ControlNet or IP-Adapter toprocess diverse control conditions. OmniGenis characterized by the followingfeatures: 1) Unification: OmniGen not only demonstrates text-to-imagegeneration capabilities but also inherently supports other downstream tasks,such as image editing, subject-driven generation, and visual-conditionalgeneration. Additionally, OmniGen can handle classical computer vision tasks bytransforming them into image generation tasks, such as edge detection and humanpose recognition. 2) Simplicity: The architecture of OmniGen is highlysimplified, eliminating the need for additional text encoders. Moreover, it ismore user-friendly compared to existing diffusion models, enabling complextasks to be accomplished through instructions without the need for extrapreprocessing steps (e.g., human pose estimation), thereby significantlysimplifying the workflow of image generation. 3) Knowledge Transfer: Throughlearning in a unified format, OmniGen effectively transfers knowledge acrossdifferent tasks, manages unseen tasks and domains, and exhibits novelcapabilities. We also explore the model's reasoning capabilities and potentialapplications of chain-of-thought mechanism.

Even LLMs applied to tasks from thehigh-performance computing (HPC) domain are huge in size and demand expensivecompute resources for training. This is partly because LLMs for HPC tasks areobtained by finetuning existing LLMs that support several natural and/orprogramming languages. We found this design choice confusing - why do we needLLMs trained on natural languages and programming languages unrelated to HPCfor HPC-specific tasks? In this line of work, we aim to question choices madeby existing LLMs by developing smaller language models (LMs) for specificdomains - we call them domain-specific LMs. Specifically, we start with HPC asa domain and build an HPC-specific LM, named MonoCoder, which is orders ofmagnitude smaller than existing LMs but delivers better performance on non-HPCand HPC codes. Specifically, we pre-trained MonoCoder on an HPC-specificdataset (named HPCorpus) of C and C++ programs mined from GitHub. We evaluatedthe performance of MonoCoder against state-of-the-art multi-lingual LLMs.Results demonstrate that MonoCoder, although much smaller than existing LMs,outperforms other LLMs on normalized-perplexity tests (in relation to modelsize) while also delivering competing CodeBLEU scores for high-performance andparallel code generations. In other words, results suggest that MonoCoderunderstands HPC code better than state-of-the-art LLMs.</description><author>Tal Kadosh, Niranjan Hasabnis, Vy A.

Currently, two primaryparadigms dominate the field of text-to-3D: the feed-forward generationsolutions, capable of swiftly producing 3D assets but often yielding coarseresults, and the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) based solutions, known forgenerating high-fidelity 3D assets albeit at a slower pace. The synergisticintegration of these methods holds substantial promise for advancing 3Dgeneration techniques. In this paper, we present BoostDream, a highly efficientplug-and-play 3D refining method designed to transform coarse 3D assets intohigh-quality. The BoostDream framework comprises three distinct processes: (1)We introduce 3D model distillation that fits differentiable representationsfrom the 3D assets obtained through feed-forward generation. (2) A novelmulti-view SDS loss is designed, which utilizes a multi-view aware 2D diffusionmodel to refine the 3D assets. (3) We propose to use prompt and multi-viewconsistent normal maps as guidance in refinement.Our extensive experiment isconducted on different differentiable 3D representations, revealing thatBoostDream excels in generating high-quality 3D assets rapidly, overcoming theJanus problem compared to conventional SDS-based methods.

Yet, this neglects findings from human psychology that describe thebenefit of self-explanations in an agent's learning process. Motivated by this,we introduce a novel workflow in the context of image classification, termedLearning by Self-Explaining (LSX). LSX utilizes aspects of self-refining AI andhuman-guided explanatory machine learning. The underlying idea is that alearner model, in addition to optimizing for the original predictive task, isfurther optimized based on explanatory feedback from an internal critic model.Intuitively, a learner's explanations are considered "useful" if the internalcritic can perform the same task given these explanations. We provide anoverview of important components of LSX and, based on this, perform extensiveexperimental evaluations via three different example instantiations. Ourresults indicate improvements via Learning by Self-Explaining on severallevels: in terms of model generalization, reducing the influence of confoundingfactors, and providing more task-relevant and faithful model explanations.Overall, our work provides evidence for the potential of self-explaining withinthe learning phase of an AI model.</description><author>Wolfgang Stammer, Felix Friedrich, David Steinmann, Manuel Brack, Hikaru Shindo, Kristian Kersting</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 16:24:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08395v3</guid></item><item><title>LYT-NET: Lightweight YUV Transformer-based Network for Low-light Image Enhancement</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15204v6</link><description>This letter introduces LYT-Net, a novel lightweight transformer-based modelfor low-light image enhancement (LLIE).

To enhance centerlineprediction, we have developed a new approach called TopoMask. Unlike previousmethods that rely on keypoints or parametric methods, TopoMask utilizes aninstance-mask-based formulation coupled with a masked-attention-basedtransformer architecture. We introduce a quad-direction label representation toenrich the mask instances with flow information and design a correspondingpost-processing technique for mask-to-centerline conversion. Additionally, wedemonstrate that the instance-mask formulation provides complementaryinformation to parametric Bezier regressions, and fusing both outputs leads toimproved detection and topology performance. Moreover, we analyze theshortcomings of the pillar assumption in the Lift Splat technique and adapt amulti-height bin configuration. Experimental results show that TopoMaskachieves state-of-the-art performance in the OpenLane-V2 dataset, increasingfrom 44.1 to 49.4 for Subset-A and 44.7 to 51.8 for Subset-B in the V1.1 OLSbaseline.</description><author>M.

LPT++ enhances frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) through theintegration of three core components. The first is a universal long-tailedadaptation module, which aggregates long-tailed prompts and visual adapters toadapt the pretrained model to the target domain, meanwhile improving itsdiscriminative ability. The second is the mixture of long-tailed expertsframework with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) scorer, which adaptively calculatesreweighting coefficients for confidence scores from both visual-only andvisual-language (VL) model experts to generate more accurate predictions.Finally, LPT++ employs a three-phase training framework, wherein each criticalmodule is learned separately, resulting in a stable and effective long-tailedclassification training paradigm. Besides, we also propose the simple versionof LPT++ namely LPT, which only integrates visual-only pretrained ViT andlong-tailed prompts to formulate a single model method.

However,Shampoo's drawbacks include additional hyperparameters and computationaloverhead when compared to Adam, which only updates running averages of first-and second-moment quantities. This work establishes a formal connection betweenShampoo (implemented with the 1/2 power) and Adafactor -- a memory-efficientapproximation of Adam -- showing that Shampoo is equivalent to runningAdafactor in the eigenbasis of Shampoo's preconditioner. This insight leads tothe design of a simpler and computationally efficient algorithm:$\textbf{S}$hampo$\textbf{O}$ with $\textbf{A}$dam in the$\textbf{P}$reconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP). With regards to improving Shampoo's computational efficiency, the moststraightforward approach would be to simply compute Shampoo'seigendecomposition less frequently. Unfortunately, as our empirical resultsshow, this leads to performance degradation that worsens with this frequency.SOAP mitigates this degradation by continually updating the running average ofthe second moment, just as Adam does, but in the current (slowly changing)coordinate basis. Furthermore, since SOAP is equivalent to running Adam in arotated space, it introduces only one additional hyperparameter (thepreconditioning frequency) compared to Adam. We empirically evaluate SOAP onlanguage model pre-training with 360m and 660m sized models. In the large batchregime, SOAP reduces the number of iterations by over 40% and wall clock timeby over 35% compared to AdamW, with approximately 20% improvements in bothmetrics compared to Shampoo.

However, there are unprecedented safety risks associated with thesethem, which are nearly unexplored so far. In this work, we aim to narrow thisgap by conducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agentsin adversarial environments. First, we present a threat model that discussesthe adversarial targets, constraints, and attack scenarios. Particularly, weconsider two types of adversarial targets: stealing users' specific personallyidentifiable information (PII) or stealing the entire user request. To achievethese objectives, we propose a novel attack method, termed EnvironmentalInjection Attack (EIA). This attack injects malicious content designed to adaptwell to different environments where the agents operate, causing them toperform unintended actions. This work instantiates EIA specifically for theprivacy scenario. It inserts malicious web elements alongside persuasiveinstructions that mislead web agents into leaking private information, and canfurther leverage CSS and JavaScript features to remain stealthy. We collect 177actions steps that involve diverse PII categories on realistic websites fromthe Mind2Web dataset, and conduct extensive experiments using one of the mostcapable generalist web agent frameworks to date, SeeAct. The resultsdemonstrate that EIA achieves up to 70% ASR in stealing users' specific PII.Stealing full user requests is more challenging, but a relaxed version of EIAcan still achieve 16% ASR. Despite these concerning results, it is important tonote that the attack can still be detectable through careful human inspection,highlighting a trade-off between high autonomy and security.

Mostresearch on detecting hallucination focuses on the questions with short andconcrete correct answers that are easy to check the faithfulness. Hallucinationdetections for text generation with open-ended answers are more challenging.Some researchers use external knowledge to detect hallucinations in generatedtexts, but external resources for specific scenarios are hard to access. Recentstudies on detecting hallucinations in long text without external resourcesconduct consistency comparison among multiple sampled outputs. To handle longtexts, researchers split long texts into multiple facts and individuallycompare the consistency of each pairs of facts. However, these methods (1)hardly achieve alignment among multiple facts; (2) overlook dependenciesbetween multiple contextual facts. In this paper, we propose a graph-basedcontext-aware (GCA) hallucination detection for text generations, which alignsknowledge facts and considers the dependencies between contextual knowledgetriples in consistency comparison. Particularly, to align multiple facts, weconduct a triple-oriented response segmentation to extract multiple knowledgetriples. To model dependencies among contextual knowledge triple (facts), weconstruct contextual triple into a graph and enhance triples' interactions viamessage passing and aggregating via RGCN.

Traditional learning-based approachesface two challenges. Firstly, natural language instructions often lack explicittask planning. Secondly, extensive training is required to equip models withknowledge of the task environment. Previous works based on Large Language Model(LLM) either suffer from poor performance due to the lack of task-specificknowledge or rely on ground truth as few-shot samples. To address the abovelimitations, we propose a novel approach called Progressive Retrieval AugmentedGeneration (P-RAG), which not only effectively leverages the powerful languageprocessing capabilities of LLMs but also progressively accumulatestask-specific knowledge without ground-truth. Compared to the conventional RAGmethods, which retrieve relevant information from the database in a one-shotmanner to assist generation, P-RAG introduces an iterative approach toprogressively update the database. In each iteration, P-RAG retrieves thelatest database and obtains historical information from the previousinteraction as experiential references for the current interaction. Moreover,we also introduce a more granular retrieval scheme that not only retrievessimilar tasks but also incorporates retrieval of similar situations to providemore valuable reference experiences. Extensive experiments reveal that P-RAGachieves competitive results without utilizing ground truth and can evenfurther improve performance through self-iterations.</description><author>Weiye Xu, Min Wang, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 15:29:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11279v1</guid></item><item><title>Machine Learning and Theory Ladenness -- A Phenomenological Account</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11277v1</link><description>In recent years, the dissemination of machine learning (ML) methodologies inscientific research has prompted discussions on theory ladenness. Morespecifically, the issue of theory ladenness has remerged as questions aboutwhether and how ML models (MLMs) and ML modelling strategies are impacted bythe domain theory of the scientific field in which ML is used and implemented(e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, etc). On the one hand, some have arguedthat there is no difference between traditional (pre ML) and ML assistedscience. In both cases, theory plays an essential and unavoidable role in theanalysis of phenomena and the construction and use of models. Others haveargued instead that ML methodologies and models are theory independent and, insome cases, even theory free. In this article, we argue that both positions areoverly simplistic and do not advance our understanding of the interplay betweenML methods and domain theories. Specifically, we provide an analysis of theoryladenness in ML assisted science. Our analysis reveals that, while theconstruction of MLMs can be relatively independent of domain theory, thepractical implementation and interpretation of these models within a givenspecific domain still relies on fundamental theoretical assumptions andbackground knowledge.</description><author>Alberto Termine, Emanuele Ratti, Alessandro Facchini</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 15:29:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11277v1</guid></item><item><title>A Systematic Review of Generalization Research in Medical Image Classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12167v3</link><description>Numerous Deep Learning (DL) classification models have been developed for alarge spectrum of medical image analysis applications, which promises toreshape various facets of medical practice. Despite early advances in DL modelvalidation and implementation, which encourage healthcare institutions to adoptthem, a fundamental questions remain: how can these models effectively handledomain shift? This question is crucial to limit DL models performancedegradation. Medical data are dynamic and prone to domain shift, due tomultiple factors. Two main shift types can occur over time: 1) covariate shiftmainly arising due to updates to medical equipment and 2) concept shift causedby inter-grader variability. To mitigate the problem of domain shift, existingsurveys mainly focus on domain adaptation techniques, with an emphasis oncovariate shift. More generally, no work has reviewed the state-of-the-artsolutions while focusing on the shift types. This paper aims to exploreexisting domain generalization methods for DL-based classification modelsthrough a systematic review of literature. It proposes a taxonomy based on theshift type they aim to solve. Papers were searched and gathered on Scopus till10 April 2023, and after the eligibility screening and quality evaluation, 77articles were identified. Exclusion criteria included: lack of methodologicalnovelty (e.g., reviews, benchmarks), experiments conducted on a singlemono-center dataset, or articles not written in English. The results of thispaper show that learning based methods are emerging, for both shift types.Finally, we discuss future challenges, including the need for improvedevaluation protocols and benchmarks, and envisioned future developments toachieve robust, generalized models for medical image classification.</description><author>Sarah Matta, Mathieu Lamard, Philippe Zhang, Alexandre Le Guilcher, Laurent Borderie, BÃ©atrice Cochener, GwenolÃ© Quellec</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 15:27:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12167v3</guid></item><item><title>MURRE: Multi-Hop Table Retrieval with Removal for Open-Domain Text-to-SQL</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10666v4</link><description>The open-domain text-to-SQL task aims to retrieve question-relevant tablesfrom massive databases and generate SQL.

However, expanding language pairsfrom an existing instruction-tuned ST system is costly due to the necessity ofre-training on a combination of new and previous datasets. We propose to expandnew language pairs by merging the model trained on new language pairs and theexisting model, using task arithmetic. We find that the direct application oftask arithmetic for ST causes the merged model to fail to follow instructions;thus, generating translation in incorrect languages. To eliminate languageconfusion, we propose an augmented task arithmetic method that merges anadditional language control model. It is trained to generate the correct targetlanguage token following the instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that ourproposed language control model can achieve language expansion by eliminatinglanguage confusion. In our MuST-C and CoVoST-2 experiments, it shows up to 4.66and 4.92 BLEU scores improvement, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate theuse of our task arithmetic framework can expand to a language pair whereneither paired ST training data nor a pre-trained ST model is available.

Optimization-based controlof such systems with discrete and continuous decision variables entails theonline solution of mixed-integer quadratic or linear programs, which sufferfrom the curse of dimensionality. Our approach aims at mitigating this issue byeffectively decoupling the decision on the discrete variables and the decisionon the continuous variables. Moreover, to mitigate the combinatorial growth inthe number of possible actions due to the prediction horizon, we conceive thedefinition of decoupled Q-functions to make the learning problem moretractable. The use of reinforcement learning reduces the online optimizationproblem of the MPC controller from a mixed-integer linear (quadratic) programto a linear (quadratic) program, greatly reducing the computational time.Simulation experiments for a microgrid, based on real-world data, demonstratethat the proposed method significantly reduces the online computation time ofthe MPC approach and that it generates policies with small optimality gaps andhigh feasibility rates.</description><author>Caio Fabio Oliveira da Silva, Azita Dabiri, Bart De Schutter</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 15:17:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11267v1</guid></item><item><title>Performance of Cross-Validated Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11265v1</link><description>Background: Advanced methods for causal inference, such as targeted maximumlikelihood estimation (TMLE), require certain conditions for statisticalinference. However, in situations where there is not differentiability due todata sparsity or near-positivity violations, the Donsker class condition isviolated. In such situations, TMLE variance can suffer from inflation of thetype I error and poor coverage, leading to conservative confidence intervals.Cross-validation of the TMLE algorithm (CVTMLE) has been suggested to improveon performance compared to TMLE in settings of positivity or Donsker classviolations. We aim to investigate the performance of CVTMLE compared to TMLE invarious settings. Methods: We utilised the data-generating mechanism as described in Leger etal. (2022) to run a Monte Carlo experiment under different Donsker classviolations. Then, we evaluated the respective statistical performances of TMLEand CVTMLE with different super learner libraries, with and without regressiontree methods. Results: We found that CVTMLE vastly improves confidence interval coveragewithout adversely affecting bias, particularly in settings with small samplesizes and near-positivity violations. Furthermore, incorporating regressiontrees using standard TMLE with ensemble super learner-based initial estimatesincreases bias and variance leading to invalid statistical inference. Conclusions: It has been shown that when using CVTMLE the Donsker classcondition is no longer necessary to obtain valid statistical inference whenusing regression trees and under either data sparsity or near-positivityviolations. We show through simulations that CVTMLE is much less sensitive tothe choice of the super learner library and thereby provides better estimationand inference in cases where the super learner library uses more flexiblecandidates and is prone to overfitting.</description><author>Matthew J.

Thisinnovative approach enables the provision of tailored networks to accommodatespecific business types or industry users, thus delivering more customized andefficient services. However, the shared memory and cache in network slicingintroduce security vulnerabilities that have yet to be fully addressed. In thispaper, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based side-channel cache attackframework specifically designed for network slicing environments. Unliketraditional cache attack methods, our framework leverages reinforcementlearning to dynamically identify and exploit cache locations storing sensitiveinformation, such as authentication keys and user registration data. We assumethat one slice network is compromised and demonstrate how the attacker caninduce another shared slice to send registration requests, thereby estimatingthe cache locations of critical data.

However, the challenge of acquiring paired videos for dynamicscenes hampers the practical deployment of deep video denoising techniques. Incontrast, this obstacle is less pronounced in image denoising, where paireddata is more readily available. Thus, a well-trained image denoiser could serveas a reliable spatial prior for video denoising. In this paper, we propose anovel unsupervised video denoising framework, named ``Temporal As a Plugin''(TAP), which integrates tunable temporal modules into a pre-trained imagedenoiser. By incorporating temporal modules, our method can harness temporalinformation across noisy frames, complementing its power of spatial denoising.Furthermore, we introduce a progressive fine-tuning strategy that refines eachtemporal module using the generated pseudo clean video frames, progressivelyenhancing the network's denoising performance.

Despite its significance, theoretically there remainmany important challenges: Existing guarantees (1) typically only hold for theaveraged iterates rather than the more desirable last iterates, (2) lackconvergence metrics that capture the scales of the variables such asWasserstein distances, and (3) mainly apply to elementary schemes such asstochastic gradient Langevin dynamics. In this paper, we develop a newframework that lifts the above issues by harnessing several tools from thetheory of dynamical systems. Our key result is that, for a large class ofstate-of-the-art sampling schemes, their last-iterate convergence inWasserstein distances can be reduced to the study of their continuous-timecounterparts, which is much better understood. Coupled with standardassumptions of MCMC sampling, our theory immediately yields the last-iterateWasserstein convergence of many advanced sampling schemes such as proximal,randomized mid-point, and Runge-Kutta integrators.

Traditional security defensesare becoming less effective against the advanced tactics of today'scyberattacks. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) has emerged as a key technology instrengthening network security, offering detailed analysis of network trafficthat goes beyond simple metadata analysis. DPI examines not only the packetheaders but also the payload content within, offering a thorough insight intothe data traversing the network. This study proposes a novel approach thatleverages a large language model (LLM) and few-shot learning to accuratelyrecognizes novel, unseen malware types with few labels samples.

This technique is designed to acclimate the model todifferent malware representations, further enabling it to generate robustembeddings for each trained and unseen classes. Following the extraction ofembeddings from the LLM, few-shot learning is utilized to enhance performancewith minimal labeled data.

To analyze this distribution, we focuson the norm of the mean embedding and the variance of the embeddings. In thisstudy, we first demonstrate that these values follow the well-known formula forvariance in statistics and provide an efficient sequential computation method.Then, by observing embeddings from intermediate layers of several Transformermodels, we found a strong trade-off relationship between the norm and thevariance: as the mean embedding becomes closer to the origin, the varianceincreases. This trade-off is likely influenced by the layer normalizationmechanism used in Transformer models. Furthermore, when the sets of tokenembeddings are treated as clusters, we show that the variance of the entireembedding set can theoretically be decomposed into the within-cluster varianceand the between-cluster variance. We found experimentally that as the layers ofTransformer models deepen, the embeddings move farther from the origin, thebetween-cluster variance relatively decreases, and the within-cluster variancerelatively increases. These results are consistent with existing studies on theanisotropy of the embedding spaces across layers.</description><author>Hiroaki Yamagiwa, Hidetoshi Shimodaira</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 15:02:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11253v1</guid></item><item><title>Design Optimization of NOMA Aided Multi-STAR-RIS for Indoor Environments: A Convex Approximation Imitated Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13280v2</link><description>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enables multiple users to share thesame frequency band, and simultaneously transmitting and reflectingreconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) provides 360-degree full-spacecoverage, optimizing both transmission and reflection for improved networkperformance and dynamic control of the indoor environment.

In this work, a novel networkarchitecture utilizing multiple access points (APs), STAR-RISs, and NOMA isproposed for indoor communication. To address these, we formulate anoptimization problem involving user assignment, access point (AP) beamforming,and STAR-RIS phase control. A decomposition approach is used to solve thecomplex problem efficiently, employing a many-to-one matching algorithm foruser-AP assignment and K-means clustering for resource management.Additionally, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) is leveraged tooptimize the control of the STAR-RIS. Within the proposed MADRL framework, anovel approach is introduced in which each decision variable acts as anindependent agent, enabling collaborative learning and decision making. TheMADRL framework is enhanced by incorporating convex approximation (CA), whichaccelerates policy learning through suboptimal solutions from successive convexapproximation (SCA), leading to faster adaptation and convergence.

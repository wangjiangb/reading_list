Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstratedpotential in code generation tasks, they often encounter issues such as refusalto code or hallucination in geospatial code generation due to a lack ofdomain-specific knowledge and code corpora. To address these challenges, thispaper presents and open-sources the GeoCode-PT and GeoCode-SFT corpora, alongwith the GeoCode-Eval evaluation dataset. Additionally, by leveraging QLoRA andLoRA for pretraining and fine-tuning, we introduce GeoCode-GPT-7B, the firstLLM focused on geospatial code generation, fine-tuned from Code Llama-7B.Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive geospatial code evaluation framework,incorporating option matching, expert validation, and prompt engineeringscoring for LLMs, and systematically evaluate GeoCode-GPT-7B using theGeoCode-Eval dataset. Experimental results show that GeoCode-GPT outperformsother models in multiple-choice accuracy by 9.1% to 32.1%, in codesummarization ability by 1.7% to 25.4%, and in code generation capability by1.2% to 25.1%. This paper provides a solution and empirical validation forenhancing LLMs' performance in geospatial code generation, extends theboundaries of domain-specific model applications, and offers valuable insightsinto unlocking their potential in geospatial code generation.</description><author>Shuyang Hou, Zhangxiao Shen, Anqi Zhao, Jianyuan Liang, Zhipeng Gui, Xuefeng Guan, Rui Li, Huayi Wu</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 13:52:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17031v2</guid></item><item><title>Optimal Design for Reward Modeling in RLHF</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17055v2</link><description>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a popularapproach to align language models (LMs) with human preferences. This methodinvolves collecting a large dataset of human pairwise preferences acrossvarious text generations and using it to infer (implicitly or explicitly) areward model. Numerous methods have been proposed to learn the reward model andalign a LM with it. However, the costly process of collecting human preferenceshas received little attention and could benefit from theoretical insights. Thispaper addresses this issue and aims to formalize the reward training model inRLHF. We frame the selection of an effective dataset as a simple regretminimization task, using a linear contextual dueling bandit method. Given thepotentially large number of arms, this approach is more coherent than thebest-arm identification setting. We then propose an offline framework forsolving this problem. Under appropriate assumptions - linearity of the rewardmodel in the embedding space, and boundedness of the reward parameter - wederive bounds on the simple regret. Finally, we provide a lower bound thatmatches our upper bound up to constant and logarithmic terms. To our knowledge,this is the first theoretical contribution in this area to provide an offlineapproach as well as worst-case guarantees.</description><author>Antoine Scheid, Etienne Boursier, Alain Durmus, Michael I.

Recently, open-source LLVMshave curated high-quality visual instruction tuning datasets and utilizedadditional vision encoders or multiple computer vision models in order tonarrow the performance gap with powerful closed-source LLVMs. Theseadvancements are attributed to multifaceted information required for diversecapabilities, including fundamental image understanding, real-world knowledgeabout common-sense and non-object concepts (e.g., charts, diagrams, symbols,signs, and math problems), and step-by-step procedures for solving complexquestions. Drawing from the multifaceted information, we present a newefficient LLVM, Mamba-based traversal of rationales (Meteor), which leveragesmultifaceted rationale to enhance understanding and answering capabilities. Toembed lengthy rationales containing abundant information, we employ the Mambaarchitecture, capable of processing sequential data with linear timecomplexity. We introduce a new concept of traversal of rationale thatfacilitates efficient embedding of rationale. Subsequently, the backbonemultimodal language model (MLM) is trained to generate answers with the aid ofrationale. Through these steps, Meteor achieves significant improvements invision language performances across multiple evaluation benchmarks requiringdiverse capabilities, without scaling up the model size or employing additionalvision encoders and computer vision models.</description><author>Byung-Kwan Lee, Chae Won Kim, Beomchan Park, Yong Man Ro</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 10:54:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15574v4</guid></item><item><title>xLSTM-Mixer: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting by Mixing via Scalar Memories</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16928v2</link><description>Time series data is prevalent across numerous fields, necessitating thedevelopment of robust and accurate forecasting models. Capturing patterns bothwithin and between temporal and multivariate components is crucial for reliablepredictions. We introduce xLSTM-Mixer, a model designed to effectivelyintegrate temporal sequences, joint time-variate information, and multipleperspectives for robust forecasting.

Despite theirsuccess in various domains like mathematical problem-solving and coding, LLMsface challenges in ensuring reliable and optimal planning due to their inherentmyopic nature of autoregressive decoding. This paper revisits LLM reasoningfrom an optimal-control perspective, proposing a novel method,Predictive-Decoding, that leverages Model Predictive Control to enhanceplanning accuracy. By re-weighting LLM distributions based on foresighttrajectories, Predictive-Decoding aims to mitigate early errors and promotenon-myopic planning.

Generative AI addresses privacy by creating fictitious identities,but fairness problems persist. We promote fairness by introducing a demographicattributes balancing mechanism in generated training datasets. We experimentwith an existing real dataset, three generated training datasets, and thebalanced versions of a diffusion-based dataset. We propose a comprehensiveevaluation that considers accuracy and fairness equally and includes a rigorousregression-based statistical analysis of attributes. The analysis shows thatbalancing reduces demographic unfairness. Also, a performance gap persistsdespite generation becoming more accurate with time.

Synthetic datasetsprovide a promising solution, enabling secure data sharing and modeldevelopment. However, most existing approaches focus on data realism ratherthan utility -- ensuring that models trained on synthetic data yield clinicallymeaningful insights comparable to those trained on real data. In this paper, wepresent Masked Clinical Modelling (MCM), a framework inspired by maskedlanguage modelling, designed for both data synthesis and conditional dataaugmentation. We evaluate this prototype on the WHAS500 dataset using CoxProportional Hazards models, focusing on the preservation of hazard ratios askey clinical metrics. Our results show that data generated using the MCMframework improves both discrimination and calibration in survival analysis,outperforming existing methods.

This highlights theurgent need for systematic methods to detect and prevent such misbehavior.While existing approaches target specific issues such as harmful responses,this work introduces LLMScan, an innovative LLM monitoring technique based oncausality analysis, offering a comprehensive solution. LLMScan systematicallymonitors the inner workings of an LLM through the lens of causal inference,operating on the premise that the LLM's `brain' behaves differently whenmisbehaving. By analyzing the causal contributions of the LLM's input tokensand transformer layers, LLMScan effectively detects misbehavior. Extensiveexperiments across various tasks and models reveal clear distinctions in thecausal distributions between normal behavior and misbehavior, enabling thedevelopment of accurate, lightweight detectors for a variety of misbehaviordetection tasks.</description><author>Mengdi Zhang, Kai Kiat Goh, Peixin Zhang, Jun Sun</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 03:41:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16638v2</guid></item><item><title>AskBeacon -- Performing genomic data exchange and analytics with natural language</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16700v2</link><description>Enabling clinicians and researchers to directly interact with global genomicdata resources by removing technological barriers is vital for medicalgenomics.

Existing works typically have two shortcomings. First, they captionimages from scratch, ignoring existing alt-text metadata, and second, lacktransparency if the captioners' training data (e.g. GPT) is unknown. In thispaper, we study a principled approach Altogether based on the key idea to editand re-align existing alt-texts associated with the images. To generatetraining data, we perform human annotation where annotators start with theexisting alt-text and re-align it to the image content in multiple rounds,consequently constructing captions with rich visual concepts. This differs fromprior work that carries out human annotation as a one-time description tasksolely based on images and annotator knowledge. We train a captioner on thisdata that generalizes the process of re-aligning alt-texts at scale. Ourresults show our Altogether approach leads to richer image captions that alsoimprove text-to-image generation and zero-shot image classification tasks.</description><author>Hu Xu, Po-Yao Huang, Xiaoqing Ellen Tan, Ching-Feng Yeh, Jacob Kahn, Christine Jou, Gargi Ghosh, Omer Levy, Luke Zettlemoyer, Wen-tau Yih, Shang-Wen Li, Saining Xie, Christoph Feichtenhofer</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 17:59:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17251v1</guid></item><item><title>JMMMU: A Japanese Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark for Culture-aware Evaluation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17250v1</link><description>Accelerating research on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in non-Englishlanguages is crucial for enhancing user experiences across broader populations.In this paper, we introduce JMMMU (Japanese MMMU), the first large-scaleJapanese benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on expert-level tasks based on theJapanese cultural context. To facilitate comprehensive culture-awareevaluation, JMMMU features two complementary subsets: (i) culture-agnostic (CA)subset, where the culture-independent subjects (e.g., Math) are selected andtranslated into Japanese, enabling one-to-one comparison with its Englishcounterpart MMMU; and (ii) culture-specific (CS) subset, comprising newlycrafted subjects that reflect Japanese cultural context. Using the CA subset,we observe performance drop in many LMMs when evaluated in Japanese, which ispurely attributable to language variation. Using the CS subset, we reveal theirinadequate Japanese cultural understanding. Further, by combining both subsets,we identify that some LMMs perform well on the CA subset but not on the CSsubset, exposing a shallow understanding of the Japanese language that lacksdepth in cultural understanding. We hope this work will not only help advanceLMM performance in Japanese but also serve as a guideline to createhigh-standard, culturally diverse benchmarks for multilingual LMM development.The project page is https://mmmu-japanese-benchmark.github.io/JMMMU/.</description><author>Shota Onohara, Atsuyuki Miyai, Yuki Imajuku, Kazuki Egashira, Jeonghun Baek, Xiang Yue, Graham Neubig, Kiyoharu Aizawa</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 17:59:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17250v1</guid></item><item><title>SpectroMotion: Dynamic 3D Reconstruction of Specular Scenes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17249v1</link><description>We present SpectroMotion, a novel approach that combines 3D GaussianSplatting (3DGS) with physically-based rendering (PBR) and deformation fieldsto reconstruct dynamic specular scenes.

Methane is the second mostimportant greenhouse gas contributor to climate change, and it's automateddetection on-board of satellites using machine learning models would allow forearly warning system and could enable new capabilities such as automatedscheduling inside constellations of satellites. Classical methods for methanedetection suffer from high false positive rates and previous deep learningmodels exhibit prohibitive computational requirements. We propose fast andaccurate machine learning architectures which support end-to-end training withdata of high spectral dimension. We evaluate our models on two tasks related tohyperspectral data processing - methane leak detection and mineralidentification. With our proposed general architectures, we improve the F1score of the previous methane detection state-of-the-art models by more than27% on a newly created synthetic dataset and by almost 13% on the previouslyreleased large benchmark dataset. We also demonstrate that training models onthe synthetic dataset improves performance of models finetuned on the datasetof real events by 6.9% in F1 score in contrast with training from scratch. On anewly created dataset for mineral identification, our models provide 3.5%improvement in the F1 score in contrast to the default versions of the models.With our proposed models we improve the inference speed by 85.19% in contrastto previous classical and deep learning approaches by removing the dependencyon classically computed features.

As the idiom "A picture is worth a thousand words"implies, representing a single image in current LVLMs can require hundreds oreven thousands of tokens. This results in significant computational costs,which grow quadratically as input image resolution increases, thereby severelyimpacting the efficiency of both training and inference. Previous approacheshave attempted to reduce the number of image tokens either before or within theearly layers of LVLMs. However, these strategies inevitably result in the lossof crucial image information, ultimately diminishing model performance. Toaddress this challenge, we conduct an empirical study revealing that all visualtokens are necessary for LVLMs in the shallow layers, and token redundancyprogressively increases in the deeper layers of the model. To this end, wepropose PyramidDrop, a visual redundancy reduction strategy for LVLMs to boosttheir efficiency in both training and inference with neglectable performanceloss. Specifically, we partition the LVLM into several stages and drop part ofthe image tokens at the end of each stage with a pre-defined ratio, creatingpyramid-like visual tokens across model layers. The dropping is based on alightweight similarity calculation with a negligible time overhead. Extensiveexperiments demonstrate that PyramidDrop can achieve a 40% training time and55% inference FLOPs acceleration of LLaVA-NeXT with comparable performance.Besides, the PyramidDrop could also serve as a plug-and-play strategy forinference acceleration without training, with better performance and lowerinference cost than counterparts. We hope that the insights and approachintroduced by PyramidDrop will inspire future research to further investigatethe role of image tokens in LVLMs.</description><author>Long Xing, Qidong Huang, Xiaoyi Dong, Jiajie Lu, Pan Zhang, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Conghui He, Jiaqi Wang, Feng Wu, Dahua Lin</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 17:59:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17247v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning Precise, Contact-Rich Manipulation through Uncalibrated Tactile Skins</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17246v1</link><description>While visuomotor policy learning has advanced robotic manipulation, preciselyexecuting contact-rich tasks remains challenging due to the limitations ofvision in reasoning about physical interactions. To address this, recent workhas sought to integrate tactile sensing into policy learning. However, manyexisting approaches rely on optical tactile sensors that are either restrictedto recognition tasks or require complex dimensionality reduction steps forpolicy learning. In this work, we explore learning policies with magnetic skinsensors, which are inherently low-dimensional, highly sensitive, andinexpensive to integrate with robotic platforms. To leverage these sensorseffectively, we present the Visuo-Skin (ViSk) framework, a simple approach thatuses a transformer-based policy and treats skin sensor data as additionaltokens alongside visual information. Evaluated on four complex real-world tasksinvolving credit card swiping, plug insertion, USB insertion, and bookshelfretrieval, ViSk significantly outperforms both vision-only and optical tactilesensing based policies. Further analysis reveals that combining tactile andvisual modalities enhances policy performance and spatial generalization,achieving an average improvement of 27.5% across tasks.https://visuoskin.github.io/</description><author>Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Yifeng Cao, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto, Raunaq Bhirangi</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 17:59:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17246v1</guid></item><item><title>Towards Reliable Evaluation of Behavior Steering Interventions in LLMs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17245v1</link><description>Representation engineering methods have recently shown promise for enablingefficient steering of model behavior. However, evaluation pipelines for thesemethods have primarily relied on subjective demonstrations, instead ofquantitative, objective metrics. We aim to take a step towards addressing thisissue by advocating for four properties missing from current evaluations: (i)contexts sufficiently similar to downstream tasks should be used for assessingintervention quality; (ii) model likelihoods should be accounted for; (iii)evaluations should allow for standardized comparisons across different targetbehaviors; and (iv) baseline comparisons should be offered. We introduce anevaluation pipeline grounded in these criteria, offering both a quantitativeand visual analysis of how effectively a given method works.

However, scaling batchsizes is constrained by the quadratic growth in GPU memory consumption,primarily due to the full instantiation of the similarity matrix. To addressthis, we propose a tile-based computation strategy that partitions thecontrastive loss calculation into arbitrary small blocks, avoiding fullmaterialization of the similarity matrix. Furthermore, we introduce amulti-level tiling strategy to leverage the hierarchical structure ofdistributed systems, employing ring-based communication at the GPU level tooptimize synchronization and fused kernels at the CUDA core level to reduce I/Ooverhead. Experimental results show that the proposed method scales batch sizesto unprecedented levels. For instance, it enables contrastive training of aCLIP-ViT-L/14 model with a batch size of 4M or 12M using 8 or 32 A800 80GBwithout sacrificing any accuracy. Compared to SOTA memory-efficient solutions,it achieves a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in memory while maintainingcomparable speed.

We introduce two architectures: (1) an encoder-decoder LVSM, whichencodes input image tokens into a fixed number of 1D latent tokens, functioningas a fully learned scene representation, and decodes novel-view images fromthem; and (2) a decoder-only LVSM, which directly maps input images tonovel-view outputs, completely eliminating intermediate scene representations.Both models bypass the 3D inductive biases used in previous methods -- from 3Drepresentations (e.g., NeRF, 3DGS) to network designs (e.g., epipolarprojections, plane sweeps) -- addressing novel view synthesis with a fullydata-driven approach. While the encoder-decoder model offers faster inferencedue to its independent latent representation, the decoder-only LVSM achievessuperior quality, scalability, and zero-shot generalization, outperformingprevious state-of-the-art methods by 1.5 to 3.5 dB PSNR. Comprehensiveevaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that both LVSM variantsachieve state-of-the-art novel view synthesis quality.

While LLM-basedagents have shown promise in automating machine learning tasks, they oftengenerate low-diversity and suboptimal code, even after multiple iterations. Toovercome these limitations, we introduce Tree-Search Enhanced LLM Agents(SELA), an innovative agent-based system that leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) to optimize the AutoML process. By representing pipeline configurationsas trees, our framework enables agents to conduct experiments intelligently anditeratively refine their strategies, facilitating a more effective explorationof the machine learning solution space. This novel approach allows SELA todiscover optimal pathways based on experimental feedback, improving the overallquality of the solutions. In an extensive evaluation across 20 machine learningdatasets, we compare the performance of traditional and agent-based AutoMLmethods, demonstrating that SELA achieves a win rate of 65% to 80% against eachbaseline across all datasets.

Despite their success, existing LLM-based Webagents overlook the importance of personalized data (e.g., user profiles andhistorical Web behaviors) in assisting the understanding of users' personalizedinstructions and executing customized actions. To overcome the limitation, wefirst formulate the task of LLM-empowered personalized Web agents, whichintegrate personalized data and user instructions to personalize instructioncomprehension and action execution. To address the absence of a comprehensiveevaluation benchmark, we construct a Personalized Web Agent Benchmark(PersonalWAB), featuring user instructions, personalized user data, Webfunctions, and two evaluation paradigms across three personalized Web tasks.Moreover, we propose a Personalized User Memory-enhanced Alignment (PUMA)framework to adapt LLMs to the personalized Web agent task. PUMA utilizes amemory bank with a task-specific retrieval strategy to filter relevanthistorical Web behaviors. Based on the behaviors, PUMA then aligns LLMs forpersonalized action execution through fine-tuning and direct preferenceoptimization. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PUMA overexisting Web agents on PersonalWAB.</description><author>Hongru Cai, Yongqi Li, Wenjie Wang, Fengbin Zhu, Xiaoyu Shen, Wenjie Li, Tat-Seng Chua</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 17:54:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17236v1</guid></item><item><title>Automated Spinal MRI Labelling from Reports Using a Large Language Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17235v1</link><description>We propose a general pipeline to automate the extraction of labels fromradiology reports using large language models, which we validate on spinal MRIreports.

Reinforcement Learning fromHuman Feedback (RLHF) has been used to alleviate this challenge by replacing ahand-coded reward function with a reward function learned from preferences.However, it can be exceedingly inefficient to learn these rewards as they areoften learned tabula rasa. We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs)can reduce this query inefficiency by converting an iterative series of humanpreferences into code representing the rewards. We propose In-ContextPreference Learning (ICPL), a method that uses the grounding of an LLM toaccelerate learning reward functions from preferences. ICPL takes theenvironment context and task description, synthesizes a set of rewardfunctions, and then repeatedly updates the reward functions using humanrankings of videos of the resultant policies. Using synthetic preferences, wedemonstrate that ICPL is orders of magnitude more efficient than RLHF and iseven competitive with methods that use ground-truth reward functions instead ofpreferences. Finally, we perform a series of human preference-learning trialsand observe that ICPL extends beyond synthetic settings and can workeffectively with humans-in-the-loop.

Weconsider a recent contamination model that combines two kinds of corruptions:(i) small fraction of arbitrary outliers, as in classical robust statistics,and (ii) local perturbations, where samples may undergo bounded shifts onaverage. While each noise model is well understood individually, the combinedcontamination model poses new algorithmic challenges, with only partial resultsknown. Existing efficient algorithms are limited in two ways: (i) they workonly for a weak notion of local perturbations, and (ii) they obtain suboptimalerror for isotropic subgaussian distributions (among others). The latterlimitation led [NGS24, COLT'24] to hypothesize that improving the error might,in fact, be computationally hard. Perhaps surprisingly, we show thatinformation theoretically optimal error can indeed be achieved in polynomialtime, under an even \emph{stronger} local perturbation model (thesliced-Wasserstein metric as opposed to the Wasserstein metric). Notably, ouranalysis reveals that the entire family of stability-based robust meanestimators continues to work optimally in a black-box manner for the combinedcontamination model. This generalization is particularly useful in real-worldscenarios where the specific form of data corruption is not known in advance.We also present efficient algorithms for distribution learning and principalcomponent analysis in the combined contamination model.</description><author>Thanasis Pittas, Ankit Pensia</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 17:51:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17230v1</guid></item><item><title>Responsibility in a Multi-Value Strategic Setting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17229v1</link><description>Responsibility is a key notion in multi-agent systems and in creating safe,reliable and ethical AI.

However, many complexreal-world queries require in-depth reasoning to identify relevant documentsthat go beyond surface form matching. For example, finding documentation for acoding question requires understanding the logic and syntax of the functionsinvolved. To better benchmark retrieval on such challenging queries, weintroduce BRIGHT, the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensivereasoning to retrieve relevant documents. Our dataset consists of 1,384real-world queries spanning diverse domains, such as economics, psychology,mathematics, and coding. These queries are drawn from naturally occurring andcarefully curated human data. Extensive evaluation reveals that evenstate-of-the-art retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT. The leading modelon the MTEB leaderboard (Muennighoff et al., 2023), which achieves a score of59.0 nDCG@10, produces a score of nDCG@10 of 18.3 on BRIGHT. We show thatincorporating explicit reasoning about the query improves retrieval performanceby up to 12.2 points. Moreover, incorporating retrieved documents from thetop-performing retriever boosts question-answering performance by over 6.6points. We believe that BRIGHT paves the way for future research on retrievalsystems in more realistic and challenging settings.</description><author>Hongjin Su, Howard Yen, Mengzhou Xia, Weijia Shi, Niklas Muennighoff, Han-yu Wang, Haisu Liu, Quan Shi, Zachary S.

A more parameter-efficient approach is PromptTuning (PT), which updates only a few learnable tokens, and differently,In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts the model to a new task by simply includingexamples in the input without any training. When applying optimization-basedmethods, such as fine-tuning and PT for few-shot learning, the model isspecifically adapted to the small set of training examples, whereas ICL leavesthe model unchanged. This distinction makes traditional learning methods moreprone to overfitting; in contrast, ICL is less sensitive to the few-shotscenario. While ICL is not prone to overfitting, it does not fully extract theinformation that exists in the training examples. This work introducesContext-aware Prompt Tuning (CPT), a method inspired by ICL, PT, andadversarial attacks. We build on the ICL strategy of concatenating examplesbefore the input, but we extend this by PT-like learning, refining the contextembedding through iterative optimization to extract deeper insights from thetraining examples. We carefully modify specific context tokens, considering theunique structure of input and output formats. Inspired by adversarial attacks,we adjust the input based on the labels present in the context, focusing onminimizing, rather than maximizing, the loss. Moreover, we apply a projectedgradient descent algorithm to keep token embeddings close to their originalvalues, under the assumption that the user-provided data is inherentlyvaluable. Our method has been shown to achieve superior accuracy acrossmultiple classification tasks using various LLM models.</description><author>Tsachi Blau, Moshe Kimhi, Yonatan Belinkov, Alexander Bronstein, Chaim Baskin</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 17:45:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17222v1</guid></item><item><title>Scalable spectral representations for network multiagent control</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17221v1</link><description>Network Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), a popular model for multi-agentcontrol, pose a significant challenge to efficient learning due to theexponential growth of the global state-action space with the number of agents.In this work, utilizing the exponential decay property of network dynamics, wefirst derive scalable spectral local representations for network MDPs, whichinduces a network linear subspace for the local $Q$-function of each agent.Building on these local spectral representations, we design a scalablealgorithmic framework for continuous state-action network MDPs, and provideend-to-end guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm.

In this paper, weintroduce the hierarchical constrained bandits (HCB) framework, which extendsthe contextual bandit problem to incorporate hierarchical decision structuresand multi-level constraints. We propose the hierarchical constrained upperconfidence bound (HC-UCB) algorithm, designed to address the complexities ofthe HCB problem by leveraging confidence bounds within a hierarchical setting.Our theoretical analysis establishes sublinear regret bounds for HC-UCB andprovides high-probability guarantees for constraint satisfaction at allhierarchical levels. Furthermore, we derive a minimax lower bound on the regretfor the HCB problem, demonstrating the near-optimality of our algorithm.

Existing methods either incur highcomputational costs due to online teacher inference, require tokenizationmatching between teacher and student LMs, or risk losing the difficulty anddiversity of the teacher-generated training data. To address these issues, wepropose MiniPLM, a KD framework for pre-training LMs by refining the trainingdata distribution with the teacher's knowledge. For efficiency, MiniPLMperforms offline teacher LM inference, allowing KD for multiple student LMswithout adding training-time costs. For flexibility, MiniPLM operates solely onthe training corpus, enabling KD across model families. For effectiveness,MiniPLM leverages the differences between large and small LMs to enhance thedifficulty and diversity of the training data, helping student LMs acquireversatile and sophisticated knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate thatMiniPLM boosts the student LMs' performance on 9 widely used downstream tasks,improves the language modeling capabilities, and reduces pre-trainingcomputation. The benefit of MiniPLM extends to large pre-training scales,evidenced by the extrapolation of the scaling curves. Further analysis revealsthat MiniPLM supports KD across model families and enhances the utilization ofpre-training data.

However, models struggle to reliably follow the inputcontext, especially when it conflicts with their parametric knowledge frompretraining. In-principle, one would expect models to adapt to the user contextbetter after instruction finetuning, particularly when handling knowledgeconflicts. However, we observe a surprising failure mode: during instructiontuning, the context reliance under knowledge conflicts initially increases asexpected, but then gradually decreases as instruction finetuning progresses.This happens while the performance on standard benchmarks keeps on increasingfar after this drop. We call this phenomenon context-parametric inversion andobserve it across multiple general purpose instruction tuning datasets such asTULU, Alpaca and Ultrachat, across different model families like Llama,Mistral, and Pythia. We perform various controlled studies and theoreticalanalysis to show that context-parametric inversion occurs due to examples inthe instruction finetuning data where the input context provides informationthat aligns with model's parametric knowledge. Our analysis suggests somenatural mitigation strategies with limited but insightful gains, and serves asa useful starting point in addressing this deficiency in instructionfinetuning.</description><author>Sachin Goyal, Christina Baek, J.

This technique allows for faster data generation andtherefore faster optimization of an experimental space. This work extends thecapabilities of asynchronous optimization methods beyond prior studies byevaluating four additional policies that incorporate pessimistic predictions inthe training data set. Combined with a conventional policy that uses modelpredictions, the five total policies were evaluated in a simulated environmentand benchmarked with serial sampling. Under some conditions and parameter spacedimensionalities, the pessimistic prediction asynchronous policy reachedoptimum experimental conditions in significantly fewer experiments thanequivalent serial policies and proved to be less susceptible to convergenceonto local optima at higher dimensions. Without accounting for the fastersampling rate, the pessimistic asynchronous algorithm presented in this workcould result in more efficient algorithm driven optimization of high-costexperimental spaces. Accounting for sampling rate, the presented asynchronousalgorithm could allow for faster optimization in experimental spaces wheremultiple experiments can be run before results are collected.</description><author>Amanda A.

However, the application of DRL in safety-critical domainspresents challenges, particularly concerning the safety of the learnedpolicies. DRL agents, which are focused on maximizing rewards, may selectunsafe actions, leading to safety violations. Runtime safety monitoring is thusessential to ensure the safe operation of these agents, especially inunpredictable and dynamic environments. This paper introduces SMARLA, ablack-box safety monitoring approach specifically designed for DRL agents.SMARLA utilizes machine learning to predict safety violations by observing theagent's behavior during execution. The approach is based on Q-values, whichreflect the expected reward for taking actions in specific states. SMARLAemploys state abstraction to reduce the complexity of the state space,enhancing the predictive capabilities of the monitoring model. Such abstractionenables the early detection of unsafe states, allowing for the implementationof corrective and preventive measures before incidents occur. We quantitativelyand qualitatively validated SMARLA on three well-known case studies widely usedin DRL research. Empirical results reveal that SMARLA is accurate at predictingsafety violations, with a low false positive rate, and can predict violationsat an early stage, approximately halfway through the execution of the agent,before violations occur. We also discuss different decision criteria, based onconfidence intervals of the predicted violation probabilities, to triggersafety mechanisms aiming at a trade-off between early detection and low falsepositive rates.</description><author>Amirhossein Zolfagharian, Manel Abdellatif, Lionel C.

By randomly initializing the feature maps, only the linearreadout needs to be trained, which reduces the computational complexitysubstantially. Viewing random feature models as Banach space-valued randomvariables, we prove a universal approximation result in the correspondingBochner space. Moreover, we derive approximation rates and an explicitalgorithm to learn an element of the given Banach space by such models. Theframework of this paper includes random trigonometric/Fourier regression and inparticular random neural networks which are single-hidden-layer feedforwardneural networks whose weights and biases are randomly initialized, whence onlythe linear readout needs to be trained. For the latter, we can then lift theuniversal approximation property of deterministic neural networks to randomneural networks, even within function spaces over non-compact domains, e.g.,weighted spaces, $L^p$-spaces, and (weighted) Sobolev spaces, where the latterincludes the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. In addition, we analyzewhen the training costs for approximating a given function grow polynomially inboth the input/output dimension and the reciprocal of a pre-specified toleratedapproximation error. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a numerical example theempirical advantages of random feature models over their deterministiccounterparts.</description><author>Ariel Neufeld, Philipp Schmocker</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 17:29:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08410v3</guid></item><item><title>EPContrast: Effective Point-level Contrastive Learning for Large-scale Point Cloud Understanding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17207v1</link><description>The acquisition of inductive bias through point-level contrastive learningholds paramount significance in point cloud pre-training. However, the squaregrowth in computational requirements with the scale of the point cloud poses asubstantial impediment to the practical deployment and execution. To addressthis challenge, this paper proposes an Effective Point-level ContrastiveLearning method for large-scale point cloud understanding dubbed\textbf{EPContrast}, which consists of AGContrast and ChannelContrast. Inpractice, AGContrast constructs positive and negative pairs based on asymmetricgranularity embedding, while ChannelContrast imposes contrastive supervisionbetween channel feature maps. EPContrast offers point-level contrastive losswhile concurrently mitigating the computational resource burden. The efficacyof EPContrast is substantiated through comprehensive validation on S3DIS andScanNetV2, encompassing tasks such as semantic segmentation, instancesegmentation, and object detection. In addition, rich ablation experimentsdemonstrate remarkable bias induction capabilities under label-efficient andone-epoch training settings.</description><author>Zhiyi Pan, Guoqing Liu, Wei Gao, Thomas H.

There is thus a pressing need for improved rainfall forecasting inthese regions. Over the last decade or so, the increased availability oflarge-scale meteorological datasets and the development of powerful machinelearning models have opened up new opportunities for data-driven weatherforecasting. Focusing on Ghana in this study, we use these tools to develop twoU-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) models, to predict 24h rainfall at 12hand 30h lead-time. The models were trained using data from the ERA5 reanalysisdataset, and the GPM-IMERG dataset. A special attention was paid tointerpretability. We developed a novel statistical methodology that allowed usto probe the relative importance of the meteorological variables input in ourmodel, offering useful insights into the factors that drive precipitation inthe Ghana region. Empirically, we found that our 12h lead-time model hasperformances that match, and in some accounts are better than the 18h lead-timeforecasts produced by the ECMWF (as available in the TIGGE dataset).

In order to better define the possibilities and limitations ofthese approaches, recent work has shown that applying KE can adversely affectmodels' factual recall accuracy and diminish their general reasoning abilities.While these studies give broad insights into the potential harms of KEalgorithms, e.g., via performance evaluations on benchmarks, we argue little isunderstood as to why such destructive failures occur. Is it possible KE methodsdistort representations of concepts beyond the targeted fact, hence hamperingabilities at broad? If so, what is the extent of this distortion? To take astep towards addressing such questions, we define a novel synthetic taskwherein a Transformer is trained from scratch to internalize a ``structured''knowledge graph. The structure enforces relationships between entities of thegraph, such that editing a factual association has "trickling effects" on otherentities in the graph (e.g., altering X's parent is Y to Z affects who X'ssiblings' parent is). Through evaluations of edited models and analysis ofextracted representations, we show that KE inadvertently affectsrepresentations of entities beyond the targeted one, distorting relevantstructures that allow a model to infer unseen knowledge about an entity. Wecall this phenomenon representation shattering and demonstrate that it resultsin degradation of factual recall and reasoning performance more broadly. Tocorroborate our findings in a more naturalistic setup, we perform preliminaryexperiments with a pretrained GPT-2-XL model and reproduce the representationshattering effect therein as well.

In this paper, we propose EDF (emphasizes thediscriminative features), a dataset distillation method that enhances keydiscriminative regions in synthetic images using Grad-CAM activation maps. Ourapproach is inspired by a key observation: in simple datasets, high-activationareas typically occupy most of the image, whereas in complex scenarios, thesize of these areas is much smaller. Unlike previous methods that treat allpixels equally when synthesizing images, EDF uses Grad-CAM activation maps toenhance high-activation areas. From a supervision perspective, we downplaysupervision signals that have lower losses, as they contain common patterns.Additionally, to help the DD community better explore complex scenarios, webuild the Complex Dataset Distillation (Comp-DD) benchmark by meticulouslyselecting sixteen subsets, eight easy and eight hard, from ImageNet-1K. Inparticular, EDF consistently outperforms SOTA results in complex scenarios,such as ImageNet-1K subsets.

Traditional IPP methods typicallyrequire high computation time during execution, giving rise to reinforcementlearning (RL) based IPP methods. However, the existing RL-based methods do notconsider spatio-temporal environments which involve their own challenges due tovariations in environment characteristics. In this paper, we propose DyPNIPP, arobust RL-based IPP framework, designed to operate effectively acrossspatio-temporal environments with varying dynamics. To achieve this, DyPNIPPincorporates domain randomization to train the agent across diverseenvironments and introduces a dynamics prediction model to capture and adaptthe agent actions to specific environment dynamics.

Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated an exceptional capacity for reasoning andproblem-solving. However, their potential in authorship analysis remainsunder-explored. Traditional studies have depended on hand-crafted stylisticfeatures, whereas state-of-the-art approaches leverage text embeddings frompre-trained language models. These methods, which typically require fine-tuningon labeled data, often suffer from performance degradation in cross-domainapplications and provide limited explainability. This work seeks to addressthree research questions: (1) Can LLMs perform zero-shot, end-to-end authorshipverification effectively? (2) Are LLMs capable of accurately attributingauthorship among multiple candidates authors (e.g., 10 and 20)? (3) Can LLMsprovide explainability in authorship analysis, particularly through the role oflinguistic features? Moreover, we investigate the integration of explicitlinguistic features to guide LLMs in their reasoning processes. Our assessmentdemonstrates LLMs' proficiency in both tasks without the need fordomain-specific fine-tuning, providing explanations into their decision makingvia a detailed analysis of linguistic features.

Given the subjective nature of political labels,third-party bias ratings like those from Ad Fontes Media, AllSides, and MediaBias/Fact Check (MBFC) are often used in research to analyze news sourcediversity. This study aims to determine if GPT-4 can replicate these humanratings on a seven-degree scale ("far-left" to "far-right"). The analysiscompares GPT-4's classifications against MBFC's, and controls for websitepopularity using Open PageRank scores. Findings reveal a high correlation($\text{Spearman's } \rho = .89$, $n = 5,877$, $p &lt; 0.001$) between GPT-4's andMBFC's ratings, indicating the model's potential reliability. However, GPT-4abstained from classifying approximately $\frac{2}{3}$ of the dataset. It ismore likely to abstain from rating unpopular websites, which also suffer fromless accurate assessments. The LLM tends to avoid classifying sources that MBFCconsiders to be centrist, resulting in more polarized outputs. Finally, thisanalysis shows a slight leftward skew in GPT's classifications compared toMBFC's. Therefore, while this paper suggests that while GPT-4 can be ascalable, cost-effective tool for political bias classification of newswebsites, its use should be as a complement to human judgment to mitigatebiases.</description><author>Raphael Hernandes, Giulio Corsi</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 16:59:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14344v2</guid></item><item><title>EMPOWER: Embodied Multi-role Open-vocabulary Planning with Online Grounding and Execution</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17379v2</link><description>Task planning for robots in real-life settings presents significantchallenges.

Knowledge sharing and model personalization are key strategiesfor addressing this issue. Clustered federated learning is a class of FLmethods that groups clients that observe similarly distributed data intoclusters, such that every client is typically associated with one datadistribution and participates in training a model for that distribution alongtheir cluster peers. In this paper, we present a unified Bayesian framework forclustered FL which associates clients to clusters. Then we propose severalpractical algorithms to handle the, otherwise growing, data associations in away that trades off performance and computational complexity.

In summary, our methods reduce the attention proportion on the first tokenfrom 65% to 3.3%, the activation kurtosis in the hidden states from 1657 to3.1, and perplexity penalty under 4-bit weight quantisation from 3565 to 0.3.</description><author>Prannay Kaul, Chengcheng Ma, Ismail Elezi, Jiankang Deng</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 16:51:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17174v1</guid></item><item><title>KANICE: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Interactive Convolutional Elements</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17172v1</link><description>We introduce KANICE (Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with InteractiveConvolutional Elements), a novel neural architecture that combinesConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)principles. KANICE integrates Interactive Convolutional Blocks (ICBs) and KANlinear layers into a CNN framework. This leverages KANs' universalapproximation capabilities and ICBs' adaptive feature learning. KANICE capturescomplex, non-linear data relationships while enabling dynamic,context-dependent feature extraction based on the Kolmogorov-Arnoldrepresentation theorem. We evaluated KANICE on four datasets: MNIST,Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and SVHN, comparing it against standard CNNs, CNN-KANhybrids, and ICB variants. KANICE consistently outperformed baseline models,achieving 99.35% accuracy on MNIST and 90.05% on the SVHN dataset. Furthermore, we introduce KANICE-mini, a compact variant designed forefficiency. A comprehensive ablation study demonstrates that KANICE-miniachieves comparable performance to KANICE with significantly fewer parameters.KANICE-mini reached 90.00% accuracy on SVHN with 2,337,828 parameters, comparedto KANICE's 25,432,000. This study highlights the potential of KAN-basedarchitectures in balancing performance and computational efficiency in imageclassification tasks.

Machine learning based methods for inverse folding typicallyuse recovery of the original sequence as the optimization objective. However,inverse folding is a one-to-many problem where several sequences can fold tothe same structure. Moreover, for many practical applications, it is oftendesirable to have multiple, diverse sequences that fold into the targetstructure since it allows for more candidate sequences for downstreamoptimizations. Here, we demonstrate that although recent inverse foldingmethods show increased sequence recovery, their "foldable diversity"-i.e. theirability to generate multiple non-similar sequences that fold into thestructures consistent with the target-does not increase. To address this, wepresent RL-DIF, a categorical diffusion model for inverse folding that ispre-trained on sequence recovery and tuned via reinforcement learning onstructural consistency. We find that RL-DIF achieves comparable sequencerecovery and structural consistency to benchmark models but shows greaterfoldable diversity: experiments show RL-DIF can achieve an foldable diversityof 29% on CATH 4.2, compared to 23% from models trained on the same dataset.The PyTorch model weights and sampling code are available on GitHub.</description><author>Yasha Ektefaie, Olivia Viessmann, Siddharth Narayanan, Drew Dresser, J.

In a post-training setting,state-of-the-art quantization and pruning methods require calibration data, asmall set of unlabeled examples. Conventionally, randomly sampled web text isused, aiming to reflect the model training data. However, this poses two keyproblems: (1) unrepresentative calibration examples can harm model performance,and (2) organizations increasingly avoid releasing model training data. In thispaper, we propose self-calibration as a solution. Our approach requires noexternal data, instead leveraging the model itself to generate syntheticcalibration data as a better approximation of the pre-training datadistribution. We extensively compare the performance of self-calibration withseveral baselines, across a variety of models, compression methods, and tasks.Our approach proves consistently competitive in maximizing downstream taskperformance, frequently outperforming even using real data.</description><author>Miles Williams, George Chrysostomou, Nikolaos Aletras</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 16:50:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17170v1</guid></item><item><title>FDINet: Protecting against DNN Model Extraction via Feature Distortion Index</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11338v3</link><description>Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms have gained popularity due totheir accessibility, cost-efficiency, scalability, and rapid developmentcapabilities. However, recent research has highlighted the vulnerability ofcloud-based models in MLaaS to model extraction attacks. In this paper, weintroduce FDINET, a novel defense mechanism that leverages the featuredistribution of deep neural network (DNN) models. Concretely, by analyzing thefeature distribution from the adversary's queries, we reveal that the featuredistribution of these queries deviates from that of the model's training set.Based on this key observation, we propose Feature Distortion Index (FDI), ametric designed to quantitatively measure the feature distribution deviation ofreceived queries. The proposed FDINET utilizes FDI to train a binary detectorand exploits FDI similarity to identify colluding adversaries from distributedextraction attacks. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate FDINET againstsix state-of-the-art extraction attacks on four benchmark datasets and fourpopular model architectures. Empirical results demonstrate the followingfindings FDINET proves to be highly effective in detecting model extraction,achieving a 100% detection accuracy on DFME and DaST. FDINET is highlyefficient, using just 50 queries to raise an extraction alarm with an averageconfidence of 96.08% for GTSRB.

Thisproperty arises in many formal languages such as temporal logics, in which allproposition symbols represent the same concept but are distinguishable fromeach other. To handle such tokens, we develop a dual-part embedding approach.The first part is shared across all interchangeable tokens, thereby enforcingthat they represent the same core concept. The second part is randomlygenerated for each token, which enables distinguishability. We evaluate ourmethod in a Transformer encoder-decoder model on two tasks: solving lineartemporal logic formulae and copying with extendable vocabulary.

This assumption limits their applicability inmany real-world domains where agents have geometric shapes, rather than beingpoint-like. Such agents, which can occupy multiple cells simultaneously, arereferred to as ``large'' agents. When considering the shape and size of agentsin MAPF, the computational complexity increases significantly as the number ofagents grows, primarily due to the increased overhead in conflict detectionbetween geometric agents. In this paper, we propose two types of subproblemsfor the LA-MAPF (Large-Agent MAPF) problem: \textbf{cluster} (which has noconstraints on the order of solution) and \textbf{level} (which imposesconstraints on the solution order). We introduce \textbf{Layered LA-MAPF}, amethod that decomposes a MAPF instance involving geometric agents intoclusters, and then further decomposes each cluster into levels. This approachaims to reduce time complexity when solving LA-MAPF problems. Our resultsdemonstrate the performance of our method as the number of agents increasesacross various maps, and how it accelerates LA-MAPF methods, such as LA-CBS andLA-LaCAM. Experiments show that our LA-MAPF method with instance decomposition\textbf{halves the time cost (reducing from an average of 40s to 20s) andtriples the success rate (from an average of 0.27 to 0.80)} in finding asolution within 60 seconds.

Recent deep time series forecasting models struggle to utilizeseasonal and trend decomposition to separate the entangled components. Such astrategy only explicitly extracts simple linear patterns like trends, leavingthe other linear modes and vast unexplored nonlinear patterns to the residual.Their flawed linear and nonlinear feature extraction models and shallow-leveldecomposition limit their adaptation to the diverse patterns present inreal-world scenarios. Given this, we innovate Recursive Residual Decompositionby introducing explicit extraction of both linear and nonlinear patterns. Thisdeeper-level decomposition framework, which is named LiNo, captures linearpatterns using a Li block which can be a moving average kernel, and modelsnonlinear patterns using a No block which can be a Transformer encoder. Theextraction of these two patterns is performed alternatively and recursively. Toachieve the full potential of LiNo, we develop the current simple linearpattern extractor to a general learnable autoregressive model, and design anovel No block that can handle all essential nonlinear patterns. Remarkably,the proposed LiNo achieves state-of-the-art on thirteen real-world benchmarksunder univariate and multivariate forecasting scenarios. Experiments show thatcurrent forecasting models can deliver more robust and precise results throughthis advanced Recursive Residual Decomposition. We hope this work could offerinsight into designing more effective forecasting models.

During pre-retrieval, tooldocuments are enhanced with key information and stored in the ToolshedKnowledge Base. Intra-retrieval focuses on query planning and transformation toincrease retrieval accuracy. Post-retrieval refines the retrieved tooldocuments and enables self-reflection. Furthermore, by varying both the totalnumber of tools (tool-M) an Agent has access to and the tool selectionthreshold (top-k), we address trade-offs between retrieval accuracy, agentperformance, and token cost.

Therefore, ControlSpeech focuses on a morechallenging new task-a TTS system with controllable timbre, content, and styleat the same time. ControlSpeech takes speech prompts, content prompts, andstyle prompts as inputs and utilizes bidirectional attention and mask-basedparallel decoding to capture corresponding codec representations in a discretedecoupling codec space. Moreover, we discovered the issue of text stylecontrollability in a many-to-many mapping fashion and proposed the StyleMixture Semantic Density (SMSD) model to resolve this problem. SMSD modulewhich is based on Gaussian mixture density networks, is designed to enhance thefine-grained partitioning and sampling capabilities of style semanticinformation and generate speech with more diverse styles.

These challenges are partially due to a lack ofstructure or inductive bias in the neural networks typically used in learningthe policy. One such form of structure that is commonly observed in multi-agentscenarios is symmetry. The field of Geometric Deep Learning has developedEquivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) that are equivariant (or symmetric) torotations, translations, and reflections of nodes. Incorporating equivariancehas been shown to improve learning efficiency and decrease error [ 2 ]. In thispaper, we demonstrate that EGNNs improve the sample efficiency andgeneralization in MARL. However, we also show that a naive application of EGNNsto MARL results in poor early exploration due to a bias in the EGNN structure.To mitigate this bias, we present Exploration-enhanced Equivariant Graph NeuralNetworks or E2GN2. We compare E2GN2 to other common function approximatorsusing common MARL benchmarks MPE and SMACv2. E2GN2 demonstrates a significantimprovement in sample efficiency, greater final reward convergence, and a 2x-5xgain in over standard GNNs in our generalization tests.

To mitigate these risks, ethical hacking, orpenetration testing, is employed to identify vulnerabilities in systems andnetworks.

However, there iscurrently no comprehensive, open, end-to-end automated penetration testingbenchmark to drive progress and evaluate the capabilities of these models insecurity contexts. This paper introduces a novel open benchmark for LLM-basedautomated penetration testing, addressing this critical gap. We first evaluatethe performance of LLMs, including GPT-4o and Llama 3.1-405B, using thestate-of-the-art PentestGPT tool.

Existing multi-modal LLMs usuallystandardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visualencoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach isnon-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputswith long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, aunified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding ofimages, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution toseamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizesand temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViTmodel that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visualrepresentations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16xcompression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx toaccommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lowerresolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precisionfor tasks like document understanding with native resolution and nocompression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation andspecialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryxachieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understandingsimultaneously.

Once more, we go over the three main components-transparency,explainability, and trustworthiness of XAI-that we determined are pertinent inthis situation. We present an overview of recent scientific studies that employtrustworthy XAI in various application fields. In the end, trustworthiness iscrucial for establishing and maintaining trust between humans and AI systems,facilitating the integration of AI systems into various applications anddomains for the benefit of society.</description><author>MD Abdullah Al Nasim, Parag Biswas, Abdur Rashid, Angona Biswas, Kishor Datta Gupta</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 16:10:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17139v1</guid></item><item><title>AlphaChimp: Tracking and Behavior Recognition of Chimpanzees</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17136v1</link><description>Understanding non-human primate behavior is crucial for improving animalwelfare, modeling social behavior, and gaining insights into both distinctlyhuman and shared behaviors. Despite recent advances in computer vision,automated analysis of primate behavior remains challenging due to thecomplexity of their social interactions and the lack of specialized algorithms.Existing methods often struggle with the nuanced behaviors and frequentocclusions characteristic of primate social dynamics. This study aims todevelop an effective method for automated detection, tracking, and recognitionof chimpanzee behaviors in video footage. Here we show that our proposedmethod, AlphaChimp, an end-to-end approach that simultaneously detectschimpanzee positions and estimates behavior categories from videos,significantly outperforms existing methods in behavior recognition. AlphaChimpachieves approximately 10% higher tracking accuracy and a 20% improvement inbehavior recognition compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularlyexcelling in the recognition of social behaviors. This superior performancestems from AlphaChimp's innovative architecture, which integrates temporalfeature fusion with a Transformer-based self-attention mechanism, enabling moreeffective capture and interpretation of complex social interactions amongchimpanzees. Our approach bridges the gap between computer vision andprimatology, enhancing technical capabilities and deepening our understandingof primate communication and sociality. We release our code and models and hopethis will facilitate future research in animal social dynamics. This workcontributes to ethology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence,offering new perspectives on social intelligence.</description><author>Xiaoxuan Ma, Yutang Lin, Yuan Xu, Stephan P.

I. Principal Demonstration in Calibration</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17135v1</link><description>Radio interferometry is an observational technique used to studyastrophysical phenomena. Data gathered by an interferometer requiressubstantial processing before astronomers can extract the scientificinformation from it. Data processing consists of a sequence of calibration andanalysis procedures where choices must be made about the sequence of proceduresas well as the specific configuration of the procedure itself. These choicesare typically based on a combination of measurable data characteristics, anunderstanding of the instrument itself, an appreciation of the trade-offsbetween compute cost and accuracy, and a learned understanding of what isconsidered "best practice". A metric of absolute correctness is not alwaysavailable and validity is often subject to human judgment. The underlyingprinciples and software configurations to discern a reasonable workflow for agiven dataset is the subject of training workshops for students and scientists.Our goal is to use objective metrics that quantify best practice, andnumerically map out the decision space with respect to our metrics. With theseobjective metrics we demonstrate an automated, data-driven, decision systemthat is capable of sequencing the optimal action(s) for processinginterferometric data. This paper introduces a simplified description of theprinciples behind interferometry and the procedures required for dataprocessing. We highlight the issues with current automation approaches andpropose our ideas for solving these bottlenecks. A prototype is demonstratedand the results are discussed.</description><author>Brian M.

However, are these models truly effective? In thiswork, we show that VLMs still struggle with natural images and questions thathumans can easily answer, which we term natural adversarial samples. We alsofind it surprisingly easy to generate these VQA samples from natural image-textcorpora using off-the-shelf models like CLIP and ChatGPT. We propose asemi-automated approach to collect a new benchmark, NaturalBench, for reliablyevaluating VLMs with 10,000 human-verified VQA samples. Crucially, we adopt a$\textbf{vision-centric}$ design by pairing each question with two images thatyield different answers, preventing blind solutions from answering withoutusing the images. This makes NaturalBench more challenging than previousbenchmarks that can be solved with commonsense priors. We evaluate 53state-of-the-art VLMs on NaturalBench, showing that models likeLLaVA-OneVision, Cambrian-1, Llama3.2-Vision, Molmo, Qwen2-VL, and even GPT-4olag 50%-70% behind human performance (over 90%). We analyze why NaturalBench ishard from two angles: (1) Compositionality: Solving NaturalBench requiresdiverse visio-linguistic skills, including understanding attribute bindings,object relationships, and advanced reasoning like logic and counting. To thisend, unlike prior work that uses a single tag per sample, we tag eachNaturalBench sample with 1 to 8 skill tags for fine-grained evaluation. (2)Biases: NaturalBench exposes severe biases in VLMs, as models often choose thesame answer regardless of the image. Lastly, we apply our benchmark curationmethod to diverse data sources, including long captions (over 100 words) andnon-English languages like Chinese and Hindi, highlighting its potential fordynamic evaluations of VLMs.</description><author>Baiqi Li, Zhiqiu Lin, Wenxuan Peng, Jean de Dieu Nyandwi, Daniel Jiang, Zixian Ma, Simran Khanuja, Ranjay Krishna, Graham Neubig, Deva Ramanan</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 16:07:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14669v2</guid></item><item><title>Aligning Large Language Models via Self-Steering Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17131v1</link><description>Automated alignment develops alignment systems with minimal humanintervention. The key to automated alignment lies in providing learnable andaccurate preference signals for preference learning without human annotation.In this paper, we introduce Self-Steering Optimization ($SSO$), an algorithmthat autonomously generates high-quality preference signals based on predefinedprinciples during iterative training, eliminating the need for manualannotation. $SSO$ maintains the accuracy of signals by ensuring a consistentgap between chosen and rejected responses while keeping them both on-policy tosuit the current policy model's learning capacity. $SSO$ can benefit the onlineand offline training of the policy model, as well as enhance the training ofreward models. We validate the effectiveness of $SSO$ with two foundationmodels, Qwen2 and Llama3.1, indicating that it provides accurate, on-policypreference signals throughout iterative training. Without any manual annotationor external models, $SSO$ leads to significant performance improvements acrosssix subjective or objective benchmarks. Besides, the preference data generatedby $SSO$ significantly enhanced the performance of the reward model onRewardbench. Our work presents a scalable approach to preference optimization,paving the way for more efficient and effective automated alignment.</description><author>Hao Xiang, Bowen Yu, Hongyu Lin, Keming Lu, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 16:04:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17131v1</guid></item><item><title>Understanding Transfer Learning via Mean-field Analysis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17128v1</link><description>We propose a novel framework for exploring generalization errors of transferlearning through the lens of differential calculus on the space of probabilitymeasures.

While open-source models, hosted locally on theuser's machine, alleviate some concerns, models that users can host locally areoften less capable than proprietary frontier models. Toward preserving userprivacy while retaining the best quality, we propose Privacy-ConsciousDelegation, a novel task for chaining API-based and local models. We utilizerecent public collections of user-LLM interactions to construct a naturalbenchmark called PUPA, which contains personally identifiable information(PII). To study potential approaches, we devise PAPILLON, a multi-stage LLMpipeline that uses prompt optimization to address a simpler version of ourtask. Our best pipeline maintains high response quality for 85.5% of userqueries while restricting privacy leakage to only 7.5%.

This paper investigates the feasibility of using PPO for directreinforcement learning (RL) from explicitly programmed reward signals, asopposed to indirect learning from human feedback via an intermediary rewardmodel. We focus on tasks expressed through formal languages, such asmathematics and programming, where explicit reward functions can be programmedto automatically assess the quality of generated outputs. We apply thisapproach to a sentiment alignment task, a simple arithmetic task, and a morecomplex game synthesis task. The sentiment alignment task replicates priorresearch and serves to validate our experimental setup. Our results show thatpure RL-based training for the two formal language tasks is challenging, withsuccess being limited even for the simple arithmetic task. We propose a novelbatch-entropy regularization term to aid exploration, although training is notyet entirely stable. Our findings suggest that direct RL training of LLMs maybe more suitable for relatively minor changes, such as alignment, than forlearning new tasks altogether, even if an informative reward signal can beexpressed programmatically.</description><author>Alexander G.

Stroke is thesecond leading cause of death world wide and dementia incidence is increasingby the year. There are several markers of CVD that are visible on brainimaging, including: white matter hyperintensities (WMH), acute and chronicischaemic stroke lesions (ISL), lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS),acute and chronic haemorrhagic lesions, and cerebral microbleeds (CMB). Brainatrophy also occurs in CVD. These markers are important for patient managementand intervention, since they indicate elevated risk of future stroke anddementia. We systematically reviewed automated systems designed to supportradiologists reporting on these CVD imaging findings. We consideredcommercially available software and research publications which identify atleast two CVD markers. In total, we included 29 commercial products and 13research publications. Two distinct types of commercial support system wereavailable: those which identify acute stroke lesions (haemorrhagic andischaemic) from computed tomography (CT) scans, mainly for the purpose ofpatient triage; and those which measure WMH and atrophy regionally andlongitudinally. In research, WMH and ISL were the markers most frequentlyanalysed together, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; lacunes and PVSwere each targeted only twice and CMB only once. For stroke, commerciallyavailable systems largely support the emergency setting, whilst researchsystems consider also follow-up and routine scans. The systems to quantify WMHand atrophy are focused on neurodegenerative disease support, where these CVDmarkers are also of significance. There are currently no openly validatedsystems, commercially, or in research, performing a comprehensive jointanalysis of all CVD markers (WMH, ISL, lacunes, PVS, haemorrhagic lesions, CMB,and atrophy).</description><author>Jesse Phitidis, Alison Q.

While both the price ofanarchy for such games as well as the computational complexity of computingtheir Nash equilibria are by now well-understood, the computational complexityof computing a system-optimal set of strategies -- that is, a centrally plannedrouting that minimizes the average cost of agents -- is severely understudiedin the literature. We close this gap by identifying the exact boundaries oftractability for the problem through the lens of the parameterized complexityparadigm. After showing that the problem remains highly intractable even onextremely simple networks, we obtain a set of results which demonstrate thatthe structural parameters which control the computational (in)tractability ofthe problem are not vertex-separator based in nature (such as, e.g.,treewidth), but rather based on edge separators. We conclude by extending ouranalysis towards the (even more challenging) min-max variant of the problem.</description><author>Cornelius Brand, Robert Ganian, Subrahmanyam Kalyanasundaram, Fionn Mc Inerney</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 15:52:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10219v2</guid></item><item><title>Learning Load Balancing with GNN in MPTCP-Enabled Heterogeneous Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17118v1</link><description>Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks are apromising paradigm of heterogeneous network (HetNet), attributed to thecomplementary physical properties of optical spectra and radio frequency.However, the current development of such HetNets is mostly bottlenecked by theexisting transmission control protocol (TCP), which restricts the userequipment (UE) to connecting one access point (AP) at a time. While the ongoinginvestigation on multipath TCP (MPTCP) can bring significant benefits, itcomplicates the network topology of HetNets, making the existing load balancing(LB) learning models less effective. Driven by this, we propose a graph neuralnetwork (GNN)-based model to tackle the LB problem for MPTCP-enabled HetNets,which results in a partial mesh topology. Such a topology can be modeled as agraph, with the channel state information and data rate requirement embedded asnode features, while the LB solutions are deemed as edge labels. Compared tothe conventional deep neural network (DNN), the proposed GNN-based modelexhibits two key strengths: i) it can better interpret a complex networktopology; and ii) it can handle various numbers of APs and UEs with a singletrained model. Simulation results show that against the traditionaloptimisation method, the proposed learning model can achieve near-optimalthroughput within a gap of 11.5%, while reducing the inference time by 4 ordersof magnitude. In contrast to the DNN model, the new method can improve thenetwork throughput by up to 21.7%, at a similar inference time level.</description><author>Han Ji, Xiping Wu, Zhihong Zeng, Chen Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 15:49:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17118v1</guid></item><item><title>PhysORD: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Physics-infused Motion Prediction in Off-road Driving</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01596v3</link><description>Motion prediction is critical for autonomous off-road driving, however, itpresents significantly more challenges than on-road driving because of thecomplex interaction between the vehicle and the terrain. Traditionalphysics-based approaches encounter difficulties in accurately modeling dynamicsystems and external disturbance. In contrast, data-driven neural networksrequire extensive datasets and struggle with explicitly capturing thefundamental physical laws, which can easily lead to poor generalization. Bymerging the advantages of both methods, neuro-symbolic approaches present apromising direction. These methods embed physical laws into neural models,potentially significantly improving generalization capabilities. However, noprior works were evaluated in real-world settings for off-road driving. Tobridge this gap, we present PhysORD, a neural-symbolic approach integrating theconservation law, i.e., the Euler-Lagrange equation, into data-driven neuralmodels for motion prediction in off-road driving. Our experiments showed thatPhysORD can accurately predict vehicle motion and tolerate external disturbanceby modeling uncertainties. The learned dynamics model achieves 46.7% higheraccuracy using only 3.1% of the parameters compared to data-driven methods,demonstrating the data efficiency and superior generalization ability of ourneural-symbolic method.</description><author>Zhipeng Zhao, Bowen Li, Yi Du, Taimeng Fu, Chen Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 15:47:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01596v3</guid></item><item><title>Enhancing Answer Attribution for Faithful Text Generation with Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17112v1</link><description>The increasing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years haschanged the way users interact with and pose questions to AI-basedconversational systems.

AlthoughBayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) allow for uncertainty in the predictions to beassessed, different sources of predictive uncertainty cannot be distinguishedproperly. We present Credal Bayesian Deep Learning (CBDL). Heuristically, CBDLallows to train an (uncountably) infinite ensemble of BNNs, using only finitelymany elements. This is possible thanks to prior and likelihood finitelygenerated credal sets (FGCSs), a concept from the imprecise probabilityliterature. Intuitively, convex combinations of a finite collection ofprior-likelihood pairs are able to represent infinitely many such pairs. Aftertraining, CBDL outputs a set of posteriors on the parameters of the neuralnetwork. At inference time, such posterior set is used to derive a set ofpredictive distributions that is in turn utilized to distinguish between(predictive) aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and to quantify them. Thepredictive set also produces either (i) a collection of outputs enjoyingdesirable probabilistic guarantees, or (ii) the single output that is deemedthe best, that is, the one having the highest predictive lower probability --another imprecise-probabilistic concept. CBDL is more robust than single BNNsto prior and likelihood misspecification, and to distribution shift. We showthat CBDL is better at quantifying and disentangling different types of(predictive) uncertainties than single BNNs and ensemble of BNNs. In addition,we apply CBDL to two case studies to demonstrate its downstream taskscapabilities: one, for motion prediction in autonomous driving scenarios, andtwo, to model blood glucose and insulin dynamics for artificial pancreascontrol. We show that CBDL performs better when compared to an ensemble of BNNsbaseline.</description><author>Michele Caprio, Souradeep Dutta, Kuk Jin Jang, Vivian Lin, Radoslav Ivanov, Oleg Sokolsky, Insup Lee</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 15:36:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09656v5</guid></item><item><title>Permutation Picture of Graph Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17111v1</link><description>This paper proposes a framework that formulates a wide range of graphcombinatorial optimization problems using permutation-based representations.These problems include the travelling salesman problem, maximum independentset, maximum cut, and various other related problems.

A powerful model that addresses this challenge isto formulate it as graph matching, which entails solving a Quadratic AssignmentProblem (QAP) with node-wise and edge-wise constraints. However, solving such aQAP can be both expensive and difficult due to numerous local extreme points.In this work, we introduce a novel linear model and solver designed toaccelerate the computation of graph matching. Specifically, we employ apositive semi-definite matrix approximation to establish the structuralattribute constraint.We then transform the original QAP into a linear modelthat is concave for maximization. This model can subsequently be solved usingthe Sinkhorn optimal transport algorithm, known for its enhanced efficiency andnumerical stability compared to existing approaches. Experimental results onthe widely used benchmark PascalVOC showcase that our algorithm achievesstate-of-the-art performance with significantly improved efficiency.

Answer aggregation isan important type of solution. The aggregated answers estimated from multiplecrowd answers to the same instance are the eventually collected annotations,rather than the individual crowd answers themselves. Recently, the capabilityof Large Language Models (LLMs) on data annotation tasks has attracted interestfrom researchers. Most of the existing studies mainly focus on the averageperformance of individual crowd workers; several recent works studied thescenarios of aggregation on categorical labels and LLMs used as label creators.However, the scenario of aggregation on text answers and the role of LLMs asaggregators are not yet well-studied. In this paper, we investigate thecapability of LLMs as aggregators in the scenario of close-ended crowd textanswer aggregation. We propose a human-LLM hybrid text answer aggregationmethod with a Creator-Aggregator Multi-Stage (CAMS) crowdsourcing framework. Wemake the experiments based on public crowdsourcing datasets.

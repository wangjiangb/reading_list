It istempting to hypothesize that anomaly detection can improve indefinitely byincreasing the scale of our networks, making their representations moreexpressive. In this paper, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence to thecontrary. In fact, we empirically show cases where very expressiverepresentations fail to detect even simple anomalies when evaluated beyond thewell-studied object-centric datasets. To investigate this phenomenon, we beginby introducing a novel theoretical toy model for anomaly detection performance.The model uncovers a fundamental trade-off between representation sufficiencyand over-expressivity. It provides evidence for a no-free-lunch theorem inanomaly detection stating that increasing representation expressivity willeventually result in performance degradation. Instead, guidance must beprovided to focus the representation on the attributes relevant to theanomalies of interest. We conduct an extensive empirical investigationdemonstrating that state-of-the-art representations often suffer fromover-expressivity, failing to detect many types of anomalies. Our investigationdemonstrates how this over-expressivity impairs image anomaly detection inpractical settings. We conclude with future directions for mitigating thisissue.</description><author>Tal Reiss, Niv Cohen, Yedid Hoshen</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 18:59:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07284v1</guid></item><item><title>Waffling around for Performance: Visual Classification with Random Words and Broad Concepts</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07282v1</link><description>The visual classification performance of vision-language models such as CLIPcan benefit from additional semantic knowledge, e.g. via large language models(LLMs) such as GPT-3. Further extending classnames with LLM-generated classdescriptors, e.g. ``waffle, \textit{which has a round shape}'', or averagingretrieval scores over multiple such descriptors, has been shown to improvegeneralization performance. In this work, we study this behavior in detail andpropose \texttt{Waffle}CLIP, a framework for zero-shot visual classificationwhich achieves similar performance gains on a large number of visualclassification tasks by simply replacing LLM-generated descriptors with randomcharacter and word descriptors \textbf{without} querying external models. Weextend these results with an extensive experimental study on the impact andshortcomings of additional semantics introduced via LLM-generated descriptors,and showcase how semantic context is better leveraged by automatically queryingLLMs for high-level concepts, while jointly resolving potential class nameambiguities.

We refer to this objective as Attention Mask Consistency (AMC) anddemonstrate that it produces superior visual grounding performance compared tomodels that rely instead on region-level annotations for explicitly training anobject detector such as Faster R-CNN. AMC works by encouraging gradient-basedexplanation masks that focus their attention scores mostly within annotatedregions of interest for images that contain such annotations. Particularly, amodel trained with AMC on top of standard vision-language modeling objectivesobtains a state-of-the-art accuracy of 86.59% in the Flickr30k visual groundingbenchmark, an absolute improvement of 5.48% when compared to the best previousmodel. Our approach also performs exceedingly well on established benchmarksfor referring expression comprehension and offers the added benefit by designof gradient-based explanations that better align with human annotations.</description><author>Ziyan Yang, Kushal Kafle, Franck Dernoncourt, Vicente Ordonez</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 18:59:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15462v3</guid></item><item><title>Controlling Text-to-Image Diffusion by Orthogonal Finetuning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07280v1</link><description>Large text-to-image diffusion models have impressive capabilities ingenerating photorealistic images from text prompts. How to effectively guide orcontrol these powerful models to perform different downstream tasks becomes animportant open problem. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a principledfinetuning method -- Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT), for adapting text-to-imagediffusion models to downstream tasks. Unlike existing methods, OFT can provablypreserve hyperspherical energy which characterizes the pairwise neuronrelationship on the unit hypersphere. We find that this property is crucial forpreserving the semantic generation ability of text-to-image diffusion models.To improve finetuning stability, we further propose Constrained OrthogonalFinetuning (COFT) which imposes an additional radius constraint to thehypersphere. Specifically, we consider two important finetuning text-to-imagetasks: subject-driven generation where the goal is to generate subject-specificimages given a few images of a subject and a text prompt, and controllablegeneration where the goal is to enable the model to take in additional controlsignals. We empirically show that our OFT framework outperforms existingmethods in generation quality and convergence speed.</description><author>Zeju Qiu, Weiyang Liu, Haiwen Feng, Yuxuan Xue, Yao Feng, Zhen Liu, Dan Zhang, Adrian Weller, Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 18:59:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07280v1</guid></item><item><title>Scalable 3D Captioning with Pretrained Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07279v1</link><description>We introduce Cap3D, an automatic approach for generating descriptive text for3D objects. This approach utilizes pretrained models from image captioning,image-text alignment, and LLM to consolidate captions from multiple views of a3D asset, completely side-stepping the time-consuming and costly process ofmanual annotation. We apply Cap3D to the recently introduced large-scale 3Ddataset, Objaverse, resulting in 660k 3D-text pairs. Our evaluation, conductedusing 41k human annotations from the same dataset, demonstrates that Cap3Dsurpasses human-authored descriptions in terms of quality, cost, and speed.Through effective prompt engineering, Cap3D rivals human performance ingenerating geometric descriptions on 17k collected annotations from the ABOdataset.

We propose a systematic approach to finding abstract patternsin mathematical data, in order to generate conjectures about mathematicalinequalities, using machine intelligence. We focus on strict inequalities oftype f &lt; g and associate them with a vector space. By geometerising this space,which we refer to as a conjecture space, we prove that this space is isomorphicto a Banach manifold. We develop a structural understanding of this conjecturespace by studying linear automorphisms of this manifold and show that thisspace admits several free group actions. Based on these insights, we propose analgorithmic pipeline to generate novel conjectures using geometric gradientdescent, where the metric is informed by the invariances of the conjecturespace. As proof of concept, we give a toy algorithm to generate novelconjectures about the prime counting function and diameters of Cayley graphs ofnon-abelian simple groups. We also report private communications withcolleagues in which some conjectures were proved, and highlight that someconjectures generated using this procedure are still unproven. Finally, wepropose a pipeline of mathematical discovery in this space and highlight theimportance of domain expertise in this pipeline.</description><author>Challenger Mishra, Subhayan Roy Moulik, Rahul Sarkar</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 18:58:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07277v1</guid></item><item><title>Transcendental Idealism of Planner: Evaluating Perception from Planning Perspective for Autonomous Driving</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07276v1</link><description>Evaluating the performance of perception modules in autonomous driving is oneof the most critical tasks in developing the complex intelligent system. Whilemodule-level unit test metrics adopted from traditional computer vision tasksare feasible to some extent, it remains far less explored to measure the impactof perceptual noise on the driving quality of autonomous vehicles in aconsistent and holistic manner. In this work, we propose a principled frameworkthat provides a coherent and systematic understanding of the impact an error inthe perception module imposes on an autonomous agent's planning that actuallycontrols the vehicle. Specifically, the planning process is formulated asexpected utility maximisation, where all input signals from upstream modulesjointly provide a world state description, and the planner strives for theoptimal action by maximising the expected utility determined by both worldstates and actions. We show that, under practical conditions, the objectivefunction can be represented as an inner product between the world statedescription and the utility function in a Hilbert space. This geometricinterpretation enables a novel way to analyse the impact of noise in worldstate estimation on planning and leads to a universal metric for evaluatingperception. The whole framework resembles the idea of transcendental idealismin the classical philosophical literature, which gives the name to ourapproach.</description><author>Wei-Xin Li, Xiaodong Yang</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 18:58:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07276v1</guid></item><item><title>Reconstructing Heterogeneous Cryo-EM Molecular Structures by Decomposing Them into Polymer Chains</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07274v1</link><description>Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has transformed structural biology byallowing to reconstruct 3D biomolecular structures up to near-atomicresolution. However, the 3D reconstruction process remains challenging, as the3D structures may exhibit substantial shape variations, while the 2D imageacquisition suffers from a low signal-to-noise ratio, requiring to acquire verylarge datasets that are time-consuming to process. Current reconstructionmethods are precise but computationally expensive, or faster but lack aphysically-plausible model of large molecular shape variations. To fill thisgap, we propose CryoChains that encodes large deformations of biomolecules viarigid body transformation of their polymer instances (chains), whilerepresenting their finer shape variations with the normal mode analysisframework of biophysics. Our synthetic data experiments on the human$\text{GABA}_{\text{B}}$ and heat shock protein show that CryoChains gives abiophysically-grounded quantification of the heterogeneous conformations ofbiomolecules, while reconstructing their 3D molecular structures at an improvedresolution compared to the current fastest, interpretable deep learning method.</description><author>Bongjin Koo, Julien Martel, Ariana Peck, Axel Levy, Fr√©d√©ric Poitevin, Nina Miolane</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 18:57:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07274v1</guid></item><item><title>Gaussian Membership Inference Privacy</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07273v1</link><description>We propose a new privacy notion called $f$-Membership Inference Privacy($f$-MIP), which explicitly considers the capabilities of realistic adversariesunder the membership inference attack threat model. By doing so $f$-MIP offersinterpretable privacy guarantees and improved utility (e.g., betterclassification accuracy). Our novel theoretical analysis of likelihoodratio-based membership inference attacks on noisy stochastic gradient descent(SGD) results in a parametric family of $f$-MIP guarantees that we refer to as$\mu$-Gaussian Membership Inference Privacy ($\mu$-GMIP). Our analysisadditionally yields an analytical membership inference attack that offersdistinct advantages over previous approaches. First, unlike existing methods,our attack does not require training hundreds of shadow models to approximatethe likelihood ratio. Second, our analytical attack enables straightforwardauditing of our privacy notion $f$-MIP. Finally, our analysis emphasizes theimportance of various factors, such as hyperparameters (e.g., batch size,number of model parameters) and data specific characteristics in controlling anattacker's success in reliably inferring a given point's membership to thetraining set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on models trainedacross vision and tabular datasets.</description><author>Tobias Leemann, Martin Pawelczyk, Gjergji Kasneci</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 18:57:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07273v1</guid></item><item><title>Zero-shot Composed Text-Image Retrieval</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07272v1</link><description>In this paper, we consider the problem of composed image retrieval (CIR), itaims to train a model that can fuse multi-modal information, e.g., text andimages, to accurately retrieve images that match the query, extending theuser's expression ability.

Although a series of DA methods have beenproposed and tailored for source code models, there lacks a comprehensivesurvey and examination to understand their effectiveness and implications. Thispaper fills this gap by conducting a comprehensive and integrative survey ofdata augmentation for source code, wherein we systematically compile andencapsulate existing literature to provide a comprehensive overview of thefield. We start by constructing a taxonomy of DA for source code models modelapproaches, followed by a discussion on prominent, methodologicallyillustrative approaches. Next, we highlight the general strategies andtechniques to optimize the DA quality. Subsequently, we underscore techniquesthat find utility in widely-accepted source code scenarios and downstreamtasks. Finally, we outline the prevailing challenges and potentialopportunities for future research. In essence, this paper endeavors todemystify the corpus of existing literature on DA for source code models, andfoster further exploration in this sphere. Complementing this, we present acontinually updated GitHub repository that hosts a list of update-to-datepapers on DA for source code models, accessible at\url{https://github.com/terryyz/DataAug4Code}.</description><author>Terry Yue Zhuo, Zhou Yang, Zhensu Sun, Yufei Wang, Li Li, Xiaoning Du, Zhenchang Xing, David Lo</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 18:55:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19915v2</guid></item><item><title>Operator Learning with Neural Fields: Tackling PDEs on General Geometries</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07266v1</link><description>Machine learning approaches for solving partial differential equationsrequire learning mappings between function spaces. While convolutional or graphneural networks are constrained to discretized functions, neural operatorspresent a promising milestone toward mapping functions directly. Despiteimpressive results they still face challenges with respect to the domaingeometry and typically rely on some form of discretization. In order toalleviate such limitations, we present CORAL, a new method that leveragescoordinate-based networks for solving PDEs on general geometries. CORAL isdesigned to remove constraints on the input mesh, making it applicable to anyspatial sampling and geometry. Its ability extends to diverse problem domains,including PDE solving, spatio-temporal forecasting, and inverse problems likegeometric design. CORAL demonstrates robust performance across multipleresolutions and performs well in both convex and non-convex domains, surpassingor performing on par with state-of-the-art models.</description><author>Louis Serrano, Lise Le Boudec, Armand Kassa√Ø Koupa√Ø, Thomas X Wang, Yuan Yin, Jean-No√´l Vittaut, Patrick Gallinari</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 18:52:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07266v1</guid></item><item><title>detrex: Benchmarking Detection Transformers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07265v1</link><description>The DEtection TRansformer (DETR) algorithm has received considerableattention in the research community and is gradually emerging as a mainstreamapproach for object detection and other perception tasks. However, the currentfield lacks a unified and comprehensive benchmark specifically tailored forDETR-based models. To address this issue, we develop a unified, highly modular,and lightweight codebase called detrex, which supports a majority of themainstream DETR-based instance recognition algorithms, covering variousfundamental tasks, including object detection, segmentation, and poseestimation. We conduct extensive experiments under detrex and perform acomprehensive benchmark for DETR-based models.

Despite their potentially transformativeimpact, these new capabilities are as yet poorly characterized. In order toinform future research, prepare for disruptive new model capabilities, andameliorate socially harmful effects, it is vital that we understand the presentand near-future capabilities and limitations of language models. To addressthis challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark(BIG-bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 450authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems fromlinguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology,physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG-bench focuses ontasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current languagemodels. We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google-internal densetransformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench,across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. Inaddition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to providea strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration bothimprove with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared withrater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes,though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually andpredictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component,whereas tasks that exhibit "breakthrough" behavior at a critical scale ofteninvolve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typicallyincreases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can beimproved with prompting.</description><author>Aarohi Srivastava, Abhinav Rastogi, Abhishek Rao, Abu Awal Md Shoeb, Abubakar Abid, Adam Fisch, Adam R.

The work launchedhundreds of papers purporting to improve over the postprocessing baseline. Weempirically evaluate these claims through thousands of model evaluations onseveral tabular datasets. We find that the fairness-accuracy Pareto frontierachieved by postprocessing contains all other methods we were feasibly able toevaluate. In doing so, we address two common methodological errors that haveconfounded previous observations. One relates to the comparison of methods withdifferent unconstrained base models. The other concerns methods achievingdifferent levels of constraint relaxation. At the heart of our study is asimple idea we call unprocessing that roughly corresponds to the inverse ofpostprocessing. Unprocessing allows for a direct comparison of methods usingdifferent underlying models and levels of relaxation. Interpreting ourfindings, we recall a widely overlooked theoretical argument, present sevenyears ago, that accurately predicted what we observe.</description><author>Andr√© F.

We adopt the overparameterization perspective -- featuringinterpolation of the training data (i.e., approximately zero train error) andthe double descent phenomenon -- to explain the delicate effect of the transferlearning setting on generalization performance. We study how the generalizationbehavior of transfer learning is affected by the dataset size in the source andtarget tasks, the number of transferred layers that are kept frozen in thetarget DNN training, and the similarity between the source and target tasks. Weshow that the test error evolution during the target DNN training has a moresignificant double descent effect when the target training dataset issufficiently large. In addition, a larger source training dataset can yield aslower target DNN training. Moreover, we demonstrate that the number of frozenlayers can determine whether the transfer learning is effectivelyunderparameterized or overparameterized and, in turn, this may induce afreezing-wise double descent phenomenon that determines the relative success orfailure of learning. Also, we show that the double descent phenomenon may makea transfer from a less related source task better than a transfer from a morerelated source task. We establish our results using image classificationexperiments with the ResNet, DenseNet and the vision transformer (ViT)architectures.</description><author>Yehuda Dar, Lorenzo Luzi, Richard G.

Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) tacklethis problem by encouraging sparsity in the precision matrix through an $l_p$regularization with $p\leq1$. However, since the objective is highly non-convexfor sub-$l_1$ pseudo-norms, most approaches rely on the $l_1$ norm. In thiscase frequentist approaches allow to elegantly compute the solution path as afunction of the shrinkage parameter $\lambda$. Instead of optimizing thepenalized likelihood, the Bayesian formulation introduces a Laplace prior onthe precision matrix. However, posterior inference for different $\lambda$values requires repeated runs of expensive Gibbs samplers. We propose a verygeneral framework for variational inference in GGMs that unifies the benefitsof frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. Specifically, we propose to approximatethe posterior with a matrix-variate Normalizing Flow defined on the space ofsymmetric positive definite matrices. As a key improvement on previous work, wetrain a continuum of sparse regression models jointly for all regularizationparameters $\lambda$ and all $l_p$ norms, including non-convex sub-$l_1$pseudo-norms. This is achieved by conditioning the flow on $p&gt;0$ and on theshrinkage parameter $\lambda$. We have then access with one model to (i) theevolution of the posterior for any $\lambda$ and for any $l_p$ (pseudo-) norms,(ii) the marginal log-likelihood for model selection, and (iii) we can recoverthe frequentist solution paths as the MAP, which is obtained through simulatedannealing.</description><author>Marcello Massimo Negri, F.

We pose this as a new type of linkprediction problem: link prediction on partially observable dynamic graphs. Ourgraph is a representation of a scene in which rooms and objects are nodes, andtheir relationships are encoded in the edges; only parts of the changing graphare known to the agent at each timestep. This partial observability poses achallenge to existing link prediction approaches, which we address. We proposea novel state representation -- Scene Graph Memory (SGM) -- with captures theagent's accumulated set of observations, as well as a neural net architecturecalled a Node Edge Predictor (NEP) that extracts information from the SGM tosearch efficiently. We evaluate our method in the Dynamic House Simulator, anew benchmark that creates diverse dynamic graphs following the semanticpatterns typically seen at homes, and show that NEP can be trained to predictthe locations of objects in a variety of environments with diverse objectmovement dynamics, outperforming baselines both in terms of new sceneadaptability and overall accuracy.

Deep learning (DL) can be used to recover high-resolutionfeatures in the low-resolution dimension through super-resolutionreconstruction (SRR). However, this often relies on paired training data whichis unavailable in many medical applications. We describe a novel approach thatonly requires native anisotropic 3D medical images for training. This methodrelies on the observation that small 2D patches extracted from a 3D volumecontain similar visual features, irrespective of their orientation. Therefore,it is possible to leverage disjoint patches from the high-resolution plane, tolearn SRR in the low-resolution plane. Our proposed unpaired approach uses amodified CycleGAN architecture with a cycle-consistent gradient mapping loss:Cycle Loss Augmented Degradation Enhancement (CLADE). We show the feasibilityof CLADE in an exemplar application; anisotropic 3D abdominal MRI data. Wedemonstrate superior quantitative image quality with CLADE over supervisedlearning and conventional CycleGAN architectures. CLADE also shows improvementsover anisotopic volumes in terms of qualitative image ranking and quantitativeedge sharpness and signal-to-noise ratio. This paper demonstrates the potentialof using CLADE for super-resolution reconstruction of anisotropic 3D medicalimaging data without the need for paired training data.</description><author>Michele Pascale, Vivek Muthurangu, Javier Montalt Tordera, Heather E Fitzke, Gauraang Bhatnagar, Stuart Taylor, Jennifer Steeden</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 18:14:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11831v2</guid></item><item><title>Reliable machine learning potentials based on artificial neural network for graphene</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07246v1</link><description>Graphene is one of the most researched two dimensional (2D) material due toits unique combination of mechanical, thermal and electrical properties.Special 2D structure of graphene enables it to exhibit a wide range of peculiarmaterial properties like high Young's modulus, high specific strength etc.which are critical for myriad of applications including light weight structuralmaterials, multi-functional coating and flexible electronics. It is quitechallenging and costly to experimentally investigate graphene/graphene basednanocomposites, computational simulations such as molecular dynamics (MD)simulations are widely adopted for understanding the microscopic origins oftheir unique properties. However, disparate results were reported fromcomputational studies, especially MD simulations using various empiricalinter-atomic potentials. In this work, an artificial neural network basedinteratomic potential has been developed for graphene to represent thepotential energy surface based on first principle calculations. The developedmachine learning potential (MLP) facilitates high fidelity MD simulations toapproach the accuracy of ab initio methods but with a fraction of computationalcost, which allows larger simulation size/length, and thereby enablesaccelerated discovery/design of graphene-based novel materials. Latticeparameter, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Young's modulus and yieldstrength are estimated using machine learning accelerated MD simulations(MLMD), which are compared to experimental/first principle calculations fromprevious literatures.

In fact, todate, there is no dataset that we are aware of that addresses this issue.Therefore, we present the agriscapes RB-Dust dataset, which is named after itspurpose of reference-based dust removal. It is not possible to take picturesfrom the cabin during tillage, as this would cause shifts in the images.Because of this, we built a setup from which it is possible to take images froma stationary position close to the passing tractor. The test setup was based ona half-sided gate through which the tractor could drive. The field tests werecarried out on a farm in Bavaria, Germany, during tillage. During the fieldtests, other parameters such as soil moisture and wind speed were controlled,as these significantly affect dust development. We validated our dataset withcontrast enhancement and image dehazing algorithms and analyzed thegeneralizability from recordings from the moving tractor. Finally, wedemonstrate the application of dust removal based on a high-level vision task,such as person classification.

With the indexing algorithm, keys arecomputed such that concepts are partially unifiable with all more specificconcepts and only semantically correct concepts are allowed to be added. Thekeys represent terminological relationships. Correctness and completeness ofthe underlying indexing algorithm are proven. The use of classical relationaldatabases for the storage of instances is described.

We are interested in universally consistent algorithms, whichachieve sublinear regret compared to any measurable fixed policy, without anyfunction class restriction. For stationary contextual bandits, when theunderlying reward mechanism is time-invariant, Blanchard et. al (2022)characterized learnable context processes for which universal consistency isachievable; and further gave algorithms ensuring universal consistency wheneverthis is achievable, a property known as optimistic universal consistency. It iswell understood, however, that reward mechanisms can evolve over time, possiblyadversarially, and depending on the learner's actions. We show that optimisticuniversal learning for contextual bandits with adversarial rewards isimpossible in general, contrary to all previously studied settings in onlinelearning -- including standard supervised learning. We also give necessary andsufficient conditions for universal learning under various adversarial rewardmodels, and an exact characterization for online rewards. In particular, theset of learnable processes for these reward models is still extremely general-- larger than i.i.d., stationary or ergodic -- but in general strictly smallerthan that for supervised learning or stationary contextual bandits, sheddinglight on new adversarial phenomena.</description><author>Moise Blanchard, Steve Hanneke, Patrick Jaillet</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 17:52:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07186v2</guid></item><item><title>Generative Plug and Play: Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07233v1</link><description>Over the past decade, Plug-and-Play (PnP) has become a popular method forreconstructing images using a modular framework consisting of a forward andprior model. The great strength of PnP is that an image denoiser can be used asa prior model while the forward model can be implemented using more traditionalphysics-based approaches. However, a limitation of PnP is that it reconstructsonly a single deterministic image. In this paper, we introduce Generative Plug-and-Play (GPnP), a generalizationof PnP to sample from the posterior distribution. As with PnP, GPnP has amodular framework using a physics-based forward model and an image denoisingprior model. However, in GPnP these models are extended to become proximalgenerators, which sample from associated distributions. GPnP applies theseproximal generators in alternation to produce samples from the posterior. Wepresent experimental simulations using the well-known BM3D denoiser. Ourresults demonstrate that the GPnP method is robust, easy to implement, andproduces intuitively reasonable samples from the posterior for sparseinterpolation and tomographic reconstruction.

Theinput to our pipeline consists of 3D strokes' polyline vertices and theircorresponding timestamps (as of the fourth dimension), along with additionalgeometric and stylus-related recorded properties. Inspired by sketchconsolidation and sketch-based modeling methods, our pipeline leverages suchdata and combines three Machine Learning (ML) models; a classifier and twoclustering models. In particular, based on observations of practices designerstypically employ in architectural design sketches, we solve a binaryclassification problem to recognize whether a stroke depicts a boundary andedge or is used to fill in the enclosing areas and faces of the intendedarchitectural object. Followed by the two clustering models, strokes of eachtype are further parsed into groups, each representing either a single edge ora single face. Next, groups representing edges are approximated with B-splinecurves, followed by a topology-recovering process identifying and fixingdesired connectivities between the curves forming a well-connected curvenetwork. Next, groups representing the faces are employed to detect the cyclesbounding patches in the curve network, resulting in the final surface meshgeometry of the architectural object.

Quantization-awaretraining (QAT) is a representative model compression method to leverageredundancy in weights and activations. However, most existing QAT methodsrequire end-to-end training on the entire dataset, which suffers from longtraining time and high energy costs. Coreset selection, aiming to improve dataefficiency utilizing the redundancy of training data, has also been widely usedfor efficient training. In this work, we propose a new angle through thecoreset selection to improve the training efficiency of quantization-awaretraining. Based on the characteristics of QAT, we propose two metrics: errorvector score and disagreement score, to quantify the importance of each sampleduring training. Guided by these two metrics of importance, we proposed aquantization-aware adaptive coreset selection (ACS) method to select the datafor the current training epoch. We evaluate our method on various networks(ResNet-18, MobileNetV2), datasets(CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K), and under differentquantization settings.

There is a natural demand for humansto manage, process, and display data efficiently. However, it necessitateslabor-intensive efforts and a high level of expertise for these data-relatedtasks. Considering that large language models (LLMs) have showcased promisingcapabilities in semantic understanding and reasoning, we advocate that thedeployment of LLMs could autonomously manage and process massive amounts ofdata while displaying and interacting in a human-friendly manner. Based on thisbelief, we propose Data-Copilot, an LLM-based system that connects numerousdata sources on one end and caters to diverse human demands on the other end.Acting like an experienced expert, Data-Copilot autonomously transforms rawdata into visualization results that best match the user's intent.Specifically, Data-Copilot autonomously designs versatile interfaces (tools)for data management, processing, prediction, and visualization.

Existingefficient ViTs adopt local attention (e.g., Swin) or linear attention (e.g.,Performer), which sacrifice ViTs' capabilities of capturing either global orlocal context. In this work, we ask an important research question: Can ViTslearn both global and local context while being more efficient duringinference? To this end, we propose a framework called Castling-ViT, whichtrains ViTs using both linear-angular attention and masked softmax-basedquadratic attention, but then switches to having only linear angular attentionduring ViT inference. Our Castling-ViT leverages angular kernels to measure thesimilarities between queries and keys via spectral angles. And we furthersimplify it with two techniques: (1) a novel linear-angular attentionmechanism: we decompose the angular kernels into linear terms and high-orderresiduals, and only keep the linear terms; and (2) we adopt two parameterizedmodules to approximate high-order residuals: a depthwise convolution and anauxiliary masked softmax attention to help learn both global and localinformation, where the masks for softmax attention are regularized to graduallybecome zeros and thus incur no overhead during ViT inference. Extensiveexperiments and ablation studies on three tasks consistently validate theeffectiveness of the proposed Castling-ViT, e.g., achieving up to a 1.8% higheraccuracy or 40% MACs reduction on ImageNet classification and 1.2 higher mAP onCOCO detection under comparable FLOPs, as compared to ViTs with vanillasoftmax-based attentions.</description><author>Haoran You, Yunyang Xiong, Xiaoliang Dai, Bichen Wu, Peizhao Zhang, Haoqi Fan, Peter Vajda, Yingyan, Lin</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 17:11:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10526v3</guid></item><item><title>Valley: Video Assistant with Large Language model Enhanced abilitY</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07207v1</link><description>Recently, several multi-modal models have been developed for joint image andlanguage understanding, which have demonstrated impressive chat abilities byutilizing advanced large language models (LLMs). The process of developing suchmodels is straightforward yet effective. It involves pre-training an adaptationmodule to align the semantics of the vision encoder and language model,followed by fine-tuning on the instruction-following data. However, despite thesuccess of this pipeline in image and language understanding, its effectivenessin joint video and language understanding has not been widely explored. In thispaper, we aim to develop a novel multi-modal foundation model capable ofperceiving video, image, and language within a general framework. To achievethis goal, we introduce Valley: Video Assistant with Large Language modelEnhanced ability. Specifically, our proposed Valley model is designed with asimple projection module that bridges video, image, and language modalities,and is further unified with a multi-lingual LLM. We also collect multi-sourcevision-text pairs and adopt a spatio-temporal pooling strategy to obtain aunified vision encoding of video and image input for pre-training. Furthermore,we generate multi-task instruction-following video data, including multi-shotcaptions, long video descriptions, action recognition, causal relationshipinference, etc. To obtain the instruction-following data, we design diverserounds of task-oriented conversations between humans and videos, facilitated byChatGPT. Qualitative examples demonstrate that our proposed model has thepotential to function as a highly effective multilingual video assistant thatcan make complex video understanding scenarios easy.

Adversarialtraining (AT) is an effective defense against adversarial examples. However, ATis prone to overfitting which degrades robustness substantially. Recently, dataaugmentation (DA) was shown to be effective in mitigating robust overfitting ifappropriately designed and optimized for AT. This work proposes a new method toautomatically learn online, instance-wise, DA policies to improve robustgeneralization for AT. A novel policy learning objective, consisting ofVulnerability, Affinity and Diversity, is proposed and shown to be sufficientlyeffective and efficient to be practical for automatic DA generation during AT.This allows our method to efficiently explore a large search space for a moreeffective DA policy and evolve the policy as training progresses. Empirically,our method is shown to outperform or match all competitive DA methods acrossvarious model architectures (CNNs and ViTs) and datasets (CIFAR10, SVHN andImagenette). Our DA policy reinforced vanilla AT to surpass severalstate-of-the-art AT methods (with baseline DA) in terms of both accuracy androbustness.

While they excel at recognizing common genericconcepts, they still struggle on fine-grained entities which are rare, or evenabsent from the pre-training dataset. Hence, a key ingredient to their successhas been the use of large-scale curated pre-training data aiming at expandingthe set of concepts that they can memorize during the pre-training stage. Inthis work, we explore an alternative to encoding fine-grained knowledgedirectly into the model's parameters: we instead train the model to retrievethis knowledge from an external memory.

Fairness in LTR models is crucial to allocate exposureproportionally to item relevance. The deterministic ranking model can lead tounfair exposure distribution when items with the same relevance receiveslightly different scores. Stochastic LTR models, incorporating thePlackett-Luce (PL) model, address fairness issues but have limitations incomputational cost and performance guarantees. To overcome these limitations,we propose FairLTR-RC, a novel post-hoc model-agnostic method. FairLTR-RCleverages a pretrained scoring function to create a stochastic LTR model,eliminating the need for expensive training. Furthermore, FairLTR-RC providesfinite-sample guarantees on a user-specified utility using distribution-freerisk control framework. By additionally incorporating the Thresholded PL (TPL)model, we are able to achieve an effective trade-off between utility andfairness.

This allows knowledgeable models to be applied toknowledge-intensive tasks prevalent in information retrieval, such as rankingor question answering. Understanding how and which factual information isacquired by our models is necessary to build responsible models. However,limited work has been done to understand the effect of pre-training tasks onthe amount of knowledge captured and forgotten by language models duringpre-training. Building a better understanding of knowledge acquisition is thegoal of this paper. Therefore, we utilize a selection of pre-training tasks toinfuse knowledge into our model. In the following steps, we test the model'sknowledge retention by measuring its ability to answer factual questions. Ourexperiments show that masking entities and principled masking of correlatedspans based on pointwise mutual information lead to more factual knowledgebeing retained than masking random tokens. Our findings demonstrate that, likethe ability to perform a task, the (factual) knowledge acquired from beingtrained on that task is forgotten when a model is trained to perform anothertask (catastrophic forgetting) and how to prevent this phenomenon.

Challenges emerge with non-stationarytraining data streams such as continual learning. One powerful approach thathas addressed this challenge involves pre-training of large encoders on volumesof readily available data, followed by task-specific tuning. Given a new task,however, updating the weights of these encoders is challenging as a largenumber of weights needs to be fine-tuned, and as a result, they forgetinformation about the previous tasks. In the present work, we propose a modelarchitecture to address this issue, building upon a discrete bottleneckcontaining pairs of separate and learnable key-value codes. Our paradigm willbe to encode; process the representation via a discrete bottleneck; and decode.Here, the input is fed to the pre-trained encoder, the output of the encoder isused to select the nearest keys, and the corresponding values are fed to thedecoder to solve the current task. The model can only fetch and re-use a sparsenumber of these key-value pairs during inference, enabling localized andcontext-dependent model updates. We theoretically investigate the ability ofthe discrete key-value bottleneck to minimize the effect of learning underdistribution shifts and show that it reduces the complexity of the hypothesisclass.

Among them,sliced OT distances have been extensively used to mitigate optimal transport'scubic algorithmic complexity and curse of dimensionality. In parallel,unbalanced OT was designed to allow comparisons of more general positivemeasures, while being more robust to outliers. In this paper, we propose tocombine these two concepts, namely slicing and unbalanced OT, to develop ageneral framework for efficiently comparing positive measures. We propose twonew loss functions based on the idea of slicing unbalanced OT, and study theirinduced topology and statistical properties.

To address this, we propose a framework, LanguageModels Augmented with Long-Term Memory (LongMem), which enables LLMs tomemorize long history. We design a novel decoupled network architecture withthe original backbone LLM frozen as a memory encoder and an adaptive residualside-network as a memory retriever and reader. Such a decoupled memory designcan easily cache and update long-term past contexts for memory retrievalwithout suffering from memory staleness. Enhanced with memory-augmentedadaptation training, LongMem can thus memorize long past context and uselong-term memory for language modeling. The proposed memory retrieval modulecan handle unlimited-length context in its memory bank to benefit variousdownstream tasks. Typically, LongMem can enlarge the long-form memory to 65ktokens and thus cache many-shot extra demonstration examples as long-formmemory for in-context learning. Experiments show that our method outperformsstrong long-context models on ChapterBreak, a challenging long-context modelingbenchmark, and achieves remarkable improvements on memory-augmented in-contextlearning over LLMs. The results demonstrate that the proposed method iseffective in helping language models to memorize and utilize long-formcontents.

Thisstudy investigates the impact of stigmatizing language (SL) in EHR notes onmortality prediction using a Transformer-based deep learning model andexplainable AI (XAI) techniques. Our findings demonstrate that SL written byclinicians adversely affects AI performance, particularly so for blackpatients, highlighting SL as a source of racial disparity in AI modeldevelopment. To explore an operationally efficient way to mitigate SL's impact,we investigate patterns in the generation of SL through a clinicians'collaborative network, identifying central clinicians as having a strongerimpact on racial disparity in the AI model. We find that removing SL written bycentral clinicians is a more efficient bias reduction strategy than eliminatingall SL in the entire corpus of data. This study provides actionable insightsfor responsible AI development and contributes to understanding clinicianbehavior and EHR note writing in healthcare.</description><author>Yizhi Liu, Weiguang Wang, Guodong Gordon Gao, Ritu Agarwal</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 16:12:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10201v4</guid></item><item><title>Shapley Value on Probabilistic Classifiers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07171v1</link><description>Data valuation has become an increasingly significant discipline in datascience due to the economic value of data. In the context of machine learning(ML), data valuation methods aim to equitably measure the contribution of eachdata point to the utility of an ML model. One prevalent method is Shapleyvalue, which helps identify data points that are beneficial or detrimental toan ML model. However, traditional Shapley-based data valuation methods may noteffectively distinguish between beneficial and detrimental training data pointsfor probabilistic classifiers. In this paper, we propose Probabilistic Shapley(P-Shapley) value by constructing a probability-wise utility function thatleverages the predicted class probabilities of probabilistic classifiers ratherthan binarized prediction results in the traditional Shapley value. We alsooffer several activation functions for confidence calibration to effectivelyquantify the marginal contribution of each data point to the probabilisticclassifiers. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate theeffectiveness of our proposed P-Shapley value in evaluating the importance ofdata for building a high-usability and trustworthy ML model.</description><author>Xiang Li, Haocheng Xia, Jinfei Liu</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 16:09:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07171v1</guid></item><item><title>Prompt-based Extraction of Social Determinants of Health Using Few-shot Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07170v1</link><description>Social determinants of health (SDOH) documented in the electronic healthrecord through unstructured text are increasingly being studied to understandhow SDOH impacts patient health outcomes.

Using convolutional neuralnetworks (CNNs) and explainable machine learning, we objectively analyze gaitdata and associate findings with clinically relevant biomarkers. This isaccomplished by connecting machine learning outputs to decisions based on humanvisual observations or derived quantitative gait parameters, which are testedand routinely implemented in curr ent healthcare practice. Our analysis of gaitdeterioration due to cognitive decline in PD enables robust results using theproposed methods for assessing PD severity from ground reaction force (GRF)data. We achieved classification accuracies of 98% F1 sc ores for eachPhysioNet.org dataset and 95.5% F1 scores for the combined PhysioNet dataset.By linking clinically observable features to the model outputs, we demonstratethe impact of PD severity on gait. Furthermore, we explore the significance ofcognit ive load in healthy gait analysis, resulting in robust classificationaccuracies of 100% F1 scores for subject identity verification.

It breaks with Shannon's classic design paradigm by aiming totransmit the meaning of a message, i.e., semantics, rather than its exactversion and thus allows for savings in information rate. In this work, weextend the fundamental approach from Basu et al. for modeling semantics to thecomplete communications Markov chain. Thus, we model semantics by means ofhidden random variables and define the semantic communication task as thedata-reduced and reliable transmission of messages over a communication channelsuch that semantics is best preserved. We cast this task as an end-to-endInformation Bottleneck problem, allowing for compression while preservingrelevant information most. As a solution approach, we propose the ML-basedsemantic communication system SINFONY and use it for a distributed multipointscenario: SINFONY communicates the meaning behind multiple messages that areobserved at different senders to a single receiver for semantic recovery. Weanalyze SINFONY by processing images as message examples. Numerical resultsreveal a tremendous rate-normalized SNR shift up to 20 dB compared toclassically designed communication systems.</description><author>Edgar Beck, Carsten Bockelmann, Armin Dekorsy</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 15:48:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13366v4</guid></item><item><title>On the Computation-Communication Trade-Off with A Flexible Gradient Tracking Approach</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07159v1</link><description>We propose a flexible gradient tracking approach with adjustable computationand communication steps for solving distributed stochastic optimization problemover networks.

We propose asimple parametric approximate posterior that adapts to the shape of the trueposterior through a Riemannian metric that is determined by the log-posteriorgradient. We develop a Riemannian Laplace approximation where samples naturallyfall into weight-regions with low negative log-posterior. We show that thesesamples can be drawn by solving a system of ordinary differential equations,which can be done efficiently by leveraging the structure of the Riemannianmetric and automatic differentiation. Empirically, we demonstrate that ourapproach consistently improves over the conventional Laplace approximationacross tasks.

Current testing scenarios typically employ predefinedor scripted BVs, which inadequately reflect the complexity of human-like socialbehaviors in real-world driving scenarios, and also lack a systematic metricfor evaluating the comprehensive intelligence of AVs. Therefore, this paperproposes an evolving scenario generation method that utilizes deepreinforcement learning (DRL) to create human-like BVs for testing andintelligence evaluation of AVs. Firstly, a class of driver models withhuman-like competitive, cooperative, and mutual driving motivations isdesigned. Then, utilizing an improved "level-k" training procedure, the threedistinct driver models acquire game-based interactive driving policies. Andthese models are assigned to BVs for generating evolving scenarios in which allBVs can interact continuously and evolve diverse contents. Next, a frameworkincluding safety, driving efficiency, and interaction utility are presented toevaluate and quantify the intelligence performance of 3 systems under test(SUTs), indicating the effectiveness of the evolving scenario for intelligencetesting. Finally, the complexity and fidelity of the proposed evolving testingscenario are validated. The results demonstrate that the proposed evolvingscenario exhibits the highest level of complexity compared to other baselinescenarios and has more than 85% similarity to naturalistic driving data. Thishighlights the potential of the proposed method to facilitate the developmentand evaluation of high-level AVs in a realistic and challenging environment.</description><author>Yining Ma, Wei Jiang, Lingtong Zhang, Junyi Chen, Hong Wang, Chen Lv, Xuesong Wang, Lu Xiong</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 15:26:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07142v1</guid></item><item><title>Decentralized SGD and Average-direction SAM are Asymptotically Equivalent</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02913v2</link><description>Decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) allows collaborativelearning on massive devices simultaneously without the control of a centralserver.

We explore how the optimal shrinking factor isaffected by clients' data heterogeneity and local epochs. Second, we dive intothe relative aggregation weights among clients to depict the clients'importance. We develop client coherence to study the learning dynamics and finda critical point that exists.

However, this widespread adoption might inadvertently trigger aself-reinforcement learning cycle that can amplify existing linguistic biases.This paper explores the possibility of such a phenomenon, where the initialbiases in GLMs, reflected in their generated text, can feed into the learningmaterial of subsequent models, thereby reinforcing and amplifying these biases.Moreover, the paper highlights how the pervasive nature of GLMs might influencethe linguistic and cognitive development of future generations, as they mayunconsciously learn and reproduce these biases. The implications of thispotential self-reinforcement cycle extend beyond the models themselves,impacting human language and discourse. The advantages and disadvantages ofthis bias amplification are weighed, considering educational benefits and easeof future GLM learning against threats to linguistic diversity and dependenceon initial GLMs. This paper underscores the need for rigorous research tounderstand and address these issues. It advocates for improved modeltransparency, bias-aware training techniques, development of methods todistinguish between human and GLM-generated text, and robust measures forfairness and bias evaluation in GLMs. The aim is to ensure the effective, safe,and equitable use of these powerful technologies, while preserving the richnessand diversity of human language.</description><author>Minhyeok Lee</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 15:17:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07135v1</guid></item><item><title>Collaborative Robotic Biopsy with Trajectory Guidance and Needle Tip Force Feedback</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07129v1</link><description>The diagnostic value of biopsies is highly dependent on the placement ofneedles.

For example, a classifier may misclassify dog breeds based onthe background of dog images. This happens when the backgrounds are correlatedwith other breeds in the training data, leading to misclassifications duringtest time. Previous SC benchmark datasets suffer from varying issues, e.g.,over-saturation or only containing one-to-one (O2O) SCs, but no many-to-many(M2M) SCs arising between groups of spurious attributes and classes. In thispaper, we present \benchmark-\{O2O, M2M\}-\{Easy, Medium, Hard\}, an imageclassification benchmark suite containing spurious correlations between classesand backgrounds. To create this dataset, we employ a text-to-image model togenerate photo-realistic images and an image captioning model to filter outunsuitable ones.

Poor adherence to medical prescriptionsconstitutes one of the main causes preventing achievement of therapeutic goals.This is generally true especially for certain diseases and specific targetpatients, such as children. An engaging and entertaining technology can beexploited in support of clinical practices to achieve better health outcomes.Our assumption is that a gamified session with a humanoid robot, compared tothe usual methodologies for therapeutic education, can be more incisive inlearning the correct inhalation procedure in children affected by asthma. Inthis perspective, we describe an interactive module implemented on the Pepperrobotic platform and the setting of a study that was planned in 2020 to be heldat the Pneumoallergology Pediatric clinic of CNR in Palermo. The study wascanceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our long-term goal is to assess, bymeans of a qualitative-quantitative survey plan, the impact of such aneducational action, evaluating possible improvement in the adherence to thetreatment.</description><author>Laura Montalbano, Agnese Augello, Giovanni Pilato, Stefania La Grutta</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 15:04:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04422v2</guid></item><item><title>Argumentative Characterizations of (Extended) Disjunctive Logic Programs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07126v1</link><description>This paper continues an established line of research about the relationsbetween argumentation theory, particularly assumption-based argumentation, anddifferent kinds of logic programs.

To address this gap, we use timed automata(TA) to introduce a family of supervised learning tasks modeling behaviordependent on hidden temporal variables whose complexity is directlycontrollable. Building upon past studies from the perspective of dynamicalsystems, we train RNNs to emulate temporal flipflops, a new collection of TAthat emphasizes the need for time-awareness over long-term memory. We find thatthese RNNs learn in phases: they quickly perfect any time-independent behavior,but they initially struggle to discover the hidden time-dependent features. Inthe case of periodic "time-of-day" aware automata, we show that the RNNs learnto switch between periodic orbits that encode time modulo the period of thetransition rules. We subsequently apply fixed point stability analysis tomonitor changes in the RNN dynamics during training, and we observe that thelearning phases are separated by a bifurcation from which the periodic behavioremerges. In this way, we demonstrate how dynamical systems theory can provideinsights into not only the learned representations of these models, but alsothe dynamics of the learning process itself. We argue that this style ofanalysis may provide insights into the training pathologies of recurrentarchitectures in contexts outside of time-awareness.</description><author>Peter DelMastro, Rushiv Arora, Edward Rietman, Hava T.

Since the nature of the return distribution is generallyunknown a priori or arbitrarily complex, a common approach finds approximationswithin a set of representable, parametric distributions. Typically, thisinvolves a projection of the unconstrained distribution onto the set ofsimplified distributions. We argue that this projection step entails a stronginductive bias when coupled with neural networks and gradient descent, therebyprofoundly impacting the generalization behavior of learned models. In order tofacilitate reliable uncertainty estimation through diversity, this work studiesthe combination of several different projections and representations in adistributional ensemble. We establish theoretical properties of such projectionensembles and derive an algorithm that uses ensemble disagreement, measured bythe average $1$-Wasserstein distance, as a bonus for deep exploration. Weevaluate our algorithm on the behavior suite benchmark and find that diverseprojection ensembles lead to significant performance improvements over existingmethods on a wide variety of tasks with the most pronounced gains in directedexploration problems.</description><author>Moritz A.

Anovel regularization is introduced, coined Type-II regularization, that allowsfor solutions to the ERM-RER problem with a support that extends outside thesupport of the reference measure. The solution to the new ERM-RER Type-IIproblem is analytically characterized in terms of the Radon-Nikodym derivativeof the reference measure with respect to the solution. The analysis of thesolution unveils the following properties of relative entropy when it acts as aregularizer in the ERM-RER problem: i) relative entropy forces the support ofthe Type-II solution to collapse into the support of the reference measure,which introduces a strong inductive bias that dominates the evidence providedby the training data; ii) Type-II regularization is equivalent to classicalrelative entropy regularization with an appropriate transformation of theempirical risk function. Closed-form expressions of the expected empirical riskas a function of the regularization parameters are provided.</description><author>Francisco Daunas, I√±aki Esnaola, Samir M. Perlaza, H.

The number of malicious applications (apps) identified for ithas increased continually over the past decade, creating an immense challengefor all parties involved. For market holders and researchers, in particular,the large number of samples has made manual malware detection unfeasible,leading to an influx of research that investigate Machine Learning (ML)approaches to automate this process. However, while some of the proposedapproaches achieve high performance, rapidly evolving Android malware has madethem unable to maintain their accuracy over time. This has created a need inthe community to conduct further research, and build more flexible MLpipelines. Doing so, however, is currently hindered by a lack of systematicoverview of the existing literature, to learn from and improve upon theexisting solutions. Existing survey papers often focus only on parts of the MLprocess (e.g., data collection or model deployment), while omitting otherimportant stages, such as model evaluation and explanation. In this paper, weaddress this problem with a review of 42 highly-cited papers, spanning a decadeof research (from 2011 to 2021). We introduce a novel procedural taxonomy ofthe published literature, covering how they have used ML algorithms, whatfeatures they have engineered, which dimensionality reduction techniques theyhave employed, what datasets they have employed for training, and what theirevaluation and explanation strategies are. Drawing from this taxonomy, we alsoidentify gaps in knowledge and provide ideas for improvement and future work.</description><author>Masoud Mehrabi Koushki, Ibrahim AbuAlhaol, Anandharaju Durai Raju, Yang Zhou, Ronnie Salvador Giagone, Huang Shengqiang</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 14:52:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07118v1</guid></item><item><title>Language of Bargaining</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07117v1</link><description>Leveraging an established exercise in negotiation education, we build a noveldataset for studying how the use of language shapes bilateral bargaining. Ourdataset extends existing work in two ways: 1) we recruit participants viabehavioral labs instead of crowdsourcing platforms and allow participants tonegotiate through audio, enabling more naturalistic interactions; 2) we add acontrol setting where participants negotiate only through alternating, writtennumeric offers.Despite the two contrasting forms of communication, we find thatthe average agreed prices of the two treatments are identical. But whensubjects can talk, fewer offers are exchanged, negotiations finish faster, thelikelihood of reaching agreement rises, and the variance of prices at whichsubjects agree drops substantially. We further propose a taxonomy of speechacts in negotiation and enrich the dataset with annotated speech acts. We setup prediction tasks to predict negotiation success and find that being reactiveto the arguments of the other party is advantageous over driving thenegotiation.</description><author>Mourad Heddaya, Solomon Dworkin, Chenhao Tan, Rob Voigt, Alexander Zentefis</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 14:52:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07117v1</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Attention Mechanisms for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in an Emergency Call Center Corpus</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07115v1</link><description>The emotion detection technology to enhance human decision-making is animportant research issue for real-world applications, but real-life emotiondatasets are relatively rare and small. The experiments conducted in this paperuse the CEMO, which was collected in a French emergency call center. Twopre-trained models based on speech and text were fine-tuned for speech emotionrecognition. Using pre-trained Transformer encoders mitigates our data'slimited and sparse nature. This paper explores the different fusion strategiesof these modality-specific models. In particular, fusions with and withoutcross-attention mechanisms were tested to gather the most relevant informationfrom both the speech and text encoders. We show that multimodal fusion bringsan absolute gain of 4-9% with respect to either single modality and that theSymmetric multi-headed cross-attention mechanism performed better than lateclassical fusion approaches. Our experiments also suggest that for thereal-life CEMO corpus, the audio component encodes more emotive informationthan the textual one.</description><author>Th√©o Deschamps-Berger, Lori Lamel, Laurence Devillers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 14:43:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07115v1</guid></item><item><title>Coupled Attention Networks for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07114v1</link><description>Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTAD) plays a vital role in awide variety of real-world application domains. Over the past few years, MTADhas attracted rapidly increasing attention from both academia and industry.Many deep learning and graph learning models have been developed for effectiveanomaly detection in multivariate time series data, which enable advancedapplications such as smart surveillance and risk management with unprecedentedcapabilities. Nevertheless, MTAD is facing critical challenges deriving fromthe dependencies among sensors and variables, which often change over time. Toaddress this issue, we propose a coupled attention-based neural networkframework (CAN) for anomaly detection in multivariate time series datafeaturing dynamic variable relationships. We combine adaptive graph learningmethods with graph attention to generate a global-local graph that canrepresent both global correlations and dynamic local correlations amongsensors. To capture inter-sensor relationships and temporal dependencies, aconvolutional neural network based on the global-local graph is integrated witha temporal self-attention module to construct a coupled attention module. Inaddition, we develop a multilevel encoder-decoder architecture thataccommodates reconstruction and prediction tasks to better characterizemultivariate time series data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasetshave been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed CAN approach,and the results show that CAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-artbaselines.</description><author>Feng Xia, Xin Chen, Shuo Yu, Mingliang Hou, Mujie Liu, Linlin You</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 14:42:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07114v1</guid></item><item><title>Linear Classifier: An Often-Forgotten Baseline for Text Classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07111v1</link><description>Large-scale pre-trained language models such as BERT are popular solutionsfor text classification.

First, for many text data, linear methods show competitiveperformance, high efficiency, and robustness. Second, advanced models such asBERT may only achieve the best results if properly applied. Simple baselineshelp to confirm whether the results of advanced models are acceptable.

In these repeatedauctions, software agents participate on behalf of aggregated advertisers tooptimize for their long-term utility. To fulfill the diverse demands, biddingstrategies are employed to optimize advertising objectives subject to differentspending constraints. Existing approaches on constrained bidding typically relyon i.i.d. train and test conditions, which contradicts the adversarial natureof online ad markets where different parties possess potentially conflictingobjectives. In this regard, we explore the problem of constrained bidding inadversarial bidding environments, which assumes no knowledge about theadversarial factors. Instead of relying on the i.i.d. assumption, our insightis to align the train distribution of environments with the potential testdistribution meanwhile minimizing policy regret. Based on this insight, wepropose a practical Minimax Regret Optimization (MiRO) approach thatinterleaves between a teacher finding adversarial environments for tutoring anda learner meta-learning its policy over the given distribution of environments.In addition, we pioneer to incorporate expert demonstrations for learningbidding strategies. Through a causality-aware policy design, we improve uponMiRO by distilling knowledge from the experts. Extensive experiments on bothindustrial data and synthetic data show that our method, MiRO withCausality-aware reinforcement Learning (MiROCL), outperforms prior methods byover 30%.</description><author>Haozhe Wang, Chao Du, Panyan Fang, Li He, Liang Wang, Bo Zheng</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 14:31:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07106v1</guid></item><item><title>Unveiling the Hessian's Connection to the Decision Boundary</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07104v1</link><description>Understanding the properties of well-generalizing minima is at the heart ofdeep learning research. On the one hand, the generalization of neural networkshas been connected to the decision boundary complexity, which is hard to studyin the high-dimensional input space. Conversely, the flatness of a minimum hasbecome a controversial proxy for generalization. In this work, we provide themissing link between the two approaches and show that the Hessian topeigenvectors characterize the decision boundary learned by the neural network.Notably, the number of outliers in the Hessian spectrum is proportional to thecomplexity of the decision boundary. Based on this finding, we provide a newand straightforward approach to studying the complexity of a high-dimensionaldecision boundary; show that this connection naturally inspires a newgeneralization measure; and finally, we develop a novel margin estimationtechnique which, in combination with the generalization measure, preciselyidentifies minima with simple wide-margin boundaries. Overall, this analysisestablishes the connection between the Hessian and the decision boundary andprovides a new method to identify minima with simple wide-margin decisionboundaries.</description><author>Mahalakshmi Sabanayagam, Freya Behrens, Urte Adomaityte, Anna Dawid</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 14:27:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07104v1</guid></item><item><title>Does Debiasing Inevitably Degrade the Model Performance</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07350v2</link><description>Gender bias in language models has attracted sufficient attention because itthreatens social justice.

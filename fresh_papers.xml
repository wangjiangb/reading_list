We examine whether we can detectpeople using only the incidental sounds they produce as they move, even whenthey try to be quiet. We collect a robotic dataset of high-quality 4-channelaudio paired with 360 degree RGB data of people moving in different indoorsettings. We train models that predict if there is a moving person nearby andtheir location using only audio. We implement our method on a robot, allowingit to track a single person moving quietly with only passive audio sensing.

We prove a square-root growth rate near zero for smoothmargin-based surrogate losses in binary classification, providing both upperand lower bounds under mild assumptions. This result also translates to excesserror bounds. Our lower bound requires weaker conditions than those in previouswork for excess error bounds, and our upper bound is entirely novel. Moreover,we extend this analysis to multi-class classification with a series of novelresults, demonstrating a universal square-root growth rate for smooth comp-sumand constrained losses, covering common choices for training neural networks inmulti-class classification. Given this universal rate, we turn to the questionof choosing among different surrogate losses. We first examine how$H$-consistency bounds vary across surrogates based on the number of classes.Next, ignoring constants and focusing on behavior near zero, we identifyminimizability gaps as the key differentiating factor in these bounds. Thus, wethoroughly analyze these gaps, to guide surrogate loss selection, covering:comparisons across different comp-sum losses, conditions where gaps becomezero, and general conditions leading to small gaps. Additionally, wedemonstrate the key role of minimizability gaps in comparing excess errorbounds and $H$-consistency bounds.</description><author>Anqi Mao, Mehryar Mohri, Yutao Zhong</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 18:59:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05968v1</guid></item><item><title>Distilling Diffusion Models into Conditional GANs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05967v1</link><description>We propose a method to distill a complex multistep diffusion model into asingle-step conditional GAN student model, dramatically accelerating inference,while preserving image quality. Our approach interprets diffusion distillationas a paired image-to-image translation task, using noise-to-image pairs of thediffusion model's ODE trajectory. For efficient regression loss computation, wepropose E-LatentLPIPS, a perceptual loss operating directly in diffusionmodel's latent space, utilizing an ensemble of augmentations. Furthermore, weadapt a diffusion model to construct a multi-scale discriminator with a textalignment loss to build an effective conditional GAN-based formulation.E-LatentLPIPS converges more efficiently than many existing distillationmethods, even accounting for dataset construction costs. We demonstrate thatour one-step generator outperforms cutting-edge one-step diffusion distillationmodels - DMD, SDXL-Turbo, and SDXL-Lightning - on the zero-shot COCO benchmark.</description><author>Minguk Kang, Richard Zhang, Connelly Barnes, Sylvain Paris, Suha Kwak, Jaesik Park, Eli Shechtman, Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 18:59:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05967v1</guid></item><item><title>Natural Language Processing RELIES on Linguistics</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05966v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become capable of generating highly fluenttext in certain languages, without modules specially designed to capturegrammar or semantic coherence.

Emphasizing the potentialadvantages of scheduling, we propose an optimization problem aimed at meetingDP requirements while minimizing the loss difference between the aggregatedmodel and the model obtained without DP constraints. To harness the benefits ofscheduling, we introduce an age-dependent upper bound on the loss, leading tothe development of an age-aware scheduling design.

TraditionalSelf-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods in TSRL fall into four main categories:reconstructive, adversarial, contrastive, and predictive, each with a commonchallenge of sensitivity to noise and intricate data nuances. Recently,diffusion-based methods have shown advanced generative capabilities. However,they primarily target specific application scenarios like imputation andforecasting, leaving a gap in leveraging diffusion models for generic TSRL. Ourwork, Time Series Diffusion Embedding (TSDE), bridges this gap as the firstdiffusion-based SSL TSRL approach. TSDE segments TS data into observed andmasked parts using an Imputation-Interpolation-Forecasting (IIF) mask. Itapplies a trainable embedding function, featuring dual-orthogonal Transformerencoders with a crossover mechanism, to the observed part. We train a reversediffusion process conditioned on the embeddings, designed to predict noiseadded to the masked part. Extensive experiments demonstrate TSDE's superiorityin imputation, interpolation, forecasting, anomaly detection, classification,and clustering. We also conduct an ablation study, present embeddingvisualizations, and compare inference speed, further substantiating TSDE'sefficiency and validity in learning representations of TS data.</description><author>Zineb Senane, Lele Cao, Valentin Leonhard Buchner, Yusuke Tashiro, Lei You, Pawel Herman, Mats Nordahl, Ruibo Tu, Vilhelm von Ehrenheim</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 18:55:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05959v1</guid></item><item><title>OpenBA-V2: Reaching 77.3% High Compression Ratio with Fast Multi-Stage Pruning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05957v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have played an important role in many fields dueto their powerful capabilities.However, their massive number of parametersleads to high deployment requirements and incurs significant inference costs,which impedes their practical applications. Training smaller models is aneffective way to address this problem. Therefore, we introduce OpenBA-V2, a3.4B model derived from multi-stage compression and continual pre-training fromthe original 15B OpenBA model. OpenBA-V2 utilizes more data, more flexibletraining objectives, and techniques such as layer pruning, neural pruning, andvocabulary pruning to achieve a compression rate of 77.3\% with minimalperformance loss. OpenBA-V2 demonstrates competitive performance compared toother open-source models of similar size, achieving results close to or on parwith the 15B OpenBA model in downstream tasks such as common sense reasoningand Named Entity Recognition (NER). OpenBA-V2 illustrates that LLMs can becompressed into smaller ones with minimal performance loss by employingadvanced training objectives and data strategies, which may help deploy LLMs inresource-limited scenarios.</description><author>Dan Qiao, Yi Su, Pinzheng Wang, Jing Ye, Wenjing Xie, Yuechi Zhou, Yuyang Ding, Zecheng Tang, Jikai Wang, Yixin Ji, Yue Wang, Pei Guo, Zechen Sun, Zikang Zhang, Juntao Li, Pingfu Chao, Wenliang Chen, Guohong Fu, Guodong Zhou, Qiaoming Zhu, Min Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 18:53:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05957v1</guid></item><item><title>Probing Multimodal LLMs as World Models for Driving</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05956v1</link><description>We provide a sober look at the application of Multimodal Large LanguageModels (MLLMs) within the domain of autonomous driving and challenge/verifysome common assumptions, focusing on their ability to reason and interpretdynamic driving scenarios through sequences of images/frames in a closed-loopcontrol environment. Despite the significant advancements in MLLMs like GPT-4V,their performance in complex, dynamic driving environments remains largelyuntested and presents a wide area of exploration. We conduct a comprehensiveexperimental study to evaluate the capability of various MLLMs as world modelsfor driving from the perspective of a fixed in-car camera. Our findings revealthat, while these models proficiently interpret individual images, theystruggle significantly with synthesizing coherent narratives or logicalsequences across frames depicting dynamic behavior. The experiments demonstrateconsiderable inaccuracies in predicting (i) basic vehicle dynamics(forward/backward, acceleration/deceleration, turning right or left), (ii)interactions with other road actors (e.g., identifying speeding cars or heavytraffic), (iii) trajectory planning, and (iv) open-set dynamic scene reasoning,suggesting biases in the models' training data. To enable this experimentalstudy we introduce a specialized simulator, DriveSim, designed to generatediverse driving scenarios, providing a platform for evaluating MLLMs in therealms of driving. Additionally, we contribute the full open-source code and anew dataset, "Eval-LLM-Drive", for evaluating MLLMs in driving.

Despite their capabilities, LLMs still encounter difficulties incompleting tasks that require high levels of accuracy and complexity due totheir inherent limitations in handling multifaceted problems single-handedly.This paper introduces "Smurfs", a cutting-edge multi-agent framework designedto revolutionize the application of LLMs. By transforming a conventional LLMinto a synergistic multi-agent ensemble, Smurfs enhances task decomposition andexecution without necessitating extra training. This is achieved throughinnovative prompting strategies that allocate distinct roles within the model,thereby facilitating collaboration among specialized agents. The frameworkgives access to external tools to efficiently solve complex tasks. Ourempirical investigation, featuring the mistral-7b-instruct model as a casestudy, showcases Smurfs' superior capability in intricate tool utilizationscenarios. Notably, Smurfs outmatches the ChatGPT-ReACT in the ToolBench I2 andI3 benchmark with a remarkable 84.4% win rate, surpassing the highest recordedperformance of a GPT-4 model at 73.5%. Furthermore, through comprehensiveablation studies, we dissect the contribution of the core components of themulti-agent framework to its overall efficacy. This not only verifies theeffectiveness of the framework, but also sets a route for future exploration ofmulti-agent LLM systems.</description><author>Junzhi Chen, Juhao Liang, Benyou Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 18:49:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05955v1</guid></item><item><title>Frame Interpolation with Consecutive Brownian Bridge Diffusion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05953v1</link><description>Recent work in Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) tries to formulate VFI as adiffusion-based conditional image generation problem, synthesizing theintermediate frame given a random noise and neighboring frames. Due to therelatively high resolution of videos, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) areemployed as the conditional generation model, where the autoencoder compressesimages into latent representations for diffusion and then reconstructs imagesfrom these latent representations. Such a formulation poses a crucialchallenge: VFI expects that the output is deterministically equal to the groundtruth intermediate frame, but LDMs randomly generate a diverse set of differentimages when the model runs multiple times. The reason for the diversegeneration is that the cumulative variance (variance accumulated at each stepof generation) of generated latent representations in LDMs is large. This makesthe sampling trajectory random, resulting in diverse rather than deterministicgenerations. To address this problem, we propose our unique solution: FrameInterpolation with Consecutive Brownian Bridge Diffusion. Specifically, wepropose consecutive Brownian Bridge diffusion that takes a deterministicinitial value as input, resulting in a much smaller cumulative variance ofgenerated latent representations. Our experiments suggest that our method canimprove together with the improvement of the autoencoder and achievestate-of-the-art performance in VFI, leaving strong potential for furtherenhancement.</description><author>Zonglin Lyu, Ming Li, Jianbo Jiao, Chen Chen</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 18:46:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05953v1</guid></item><item><title>Federated Combinatorial Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05950v1</link><description>This paper introduces a federated learning framework tailored for onlinecombinatorial optimization with bandit feedback. In this setting, agents selectsubsets of arms, observe noisy rewards for these subsets without accessingindividual arm information, and can cooperate and share information at specificintervals. Our framework transforms any offline resilient single-agent$(\alpha-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, having a complexity of$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{\psi}{\epsilon^\beta})$, where the logarithm isomitted, for some function $\psi$ and constant $\beta$, into an onlinemulti-agent algorithm with $m$ communicating agents and an $\alpha$-regret ofno more than $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m^{-\frac{1}{3+\beta}} \psi^\frac{1}{3+\beta}T^\frac{2+\beta}{3+\beta})$. This approach not only eliminates the $\epsilon$approximation error but also ensures sublinear growth with respect to the timehorizon $T$ and demonstrates a linear speedup with an increasing number ofcommunicating agents. Additionally, the algorithm is notablycommunication-efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of communicationrounds, quantified as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\psiT^\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\right)$. Furthermore, the framework has beensuccessfully applied to online stochastic submodular maximization using variousoffline algorithms, yielding the first results for both single-agent andmulti-agent settings and recovering specialized single-agent theoreticalguarantees. We empirically validate our approach to a stochastic datasummarization problem, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposedframework, even in single-agent scenarios.</description><author>Fares Fourati, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, Vaneet Aggarwal</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 18:40:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05950v1</guid></item><item><title>CuMo: Scaling Multimodal LLM with Co-Upcycled Mixture-of-Experts</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05949v1</link><description>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have focusedprimarily on scaling by increasing text-image pair data and enhancing LLMs toimprove performance on multimodal tasks. However, these scaling approaches arecomputationally expensive and overlook the significance of improving modelcapabilities from the vision side. Inspired by the successful applications ofMixture-of-Experts (MoE) in LLMs, which improves model scalability duringtraining while keeping inference costs similar to those of smaller models, wepropose CuMo. CuMo incorporates Co-upcycled Top-K sparsely-gatedMixture-of-experts blocks into both the vision encoder and the MLP connector,thereby enhancing the multimodal LLMs with minimal additional activatedparameters during inference. CuMo first pre-trains the MLP blocks and theninitializes each expert in the MoE block from the pre-trained MLP block duringthe visual instruction tuning stage. Auxiliary losses are used to ensure abalanced loading of experts. CuMo outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal LLMsacross various VQA and visual-instruction-following benchmarks using modelswithin each model size group, all while training exclusively on open-sourceddatasets.

However, severalsignificant challenges remain: (i) most of these models rely on 2D images yetexhibit a limited capacity for 3D input; (ii) these models rarely explore thetasks inherently defined in 3D world, e.g., 3D grounding, embodied reasoningand acting. We argue these limitations significantly hinder current models fromperforming real-world tasks and approaching general intelligence. To this end,we introduce LEO, an embodied multi-modal generalist agent that excels inperceiving, grounding, reasoning, planning, and acting in the 3D world. LEO istrained with a unified task interface, model architecture, and objective in twostages: (i) 3D vision-language (VL) alignment and (ii) 3Dvision-language-action (VLA) instruction tuning. We collect large-scaledatasets comprising diverse object-level and scene-level tasks, which requireconsiderable understanding of and interaction with the 3D world. Moreover, wemeticulously design an LLM-assisted pipeline to produce high-quality 3D VLdata. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate LEO's remarkableproficiency across a wide spectrum of tasks, including 3D captioning, questionanswering, embodied reasoning, navigation and manipulation. Our ablativestudies and scaling analyses further provide valuable insights for developingfuture embodied generalist agents.

In thistechnical report, we introduce the Lumina-T2X family - a series of Flow-basedLarge Diffusion Transformers (Flag-DiT) equipped with zero-initializedattention, as a unified framework designed to transform noise into images,videos, multi-view 3D objects, and audio clips conditioned on textinstructions. By tokenizing the latent spatial-temporal space and incorporatinglearnable placeholders such as [nextline] and [nextframe] tokens, Lumina-T2Xseamlessly unifies the representations of different modalities across variousspatial-temporal resolutions. This unified approach enables training within asingle framework for different modalities and allows for flexible generation ofmultimodal data at any resolution, aspect ratio, and length during inference.Advanced techniques like RoPE, RMSNorm, and flow matching enhance thestability, flexibility, and scalability of Flag-DiT, enabling models ofLumina-T2X to scale up to 7 billion parameters and extend the context window to128K tokens. This is particularly beneficial for creating ultra-high-definitionimages with our Lumina-T2I model and long 720p videos with our Lumina-T2Vmodel. Remarkably, Lumina-T2I, powered by a 5-billion-parameter Flag-DiT,requires only 35% of the training computational costs of a600-million-parameter naive DiT. Our further comprehensive analysis underscoresLumina-T2X's preliminary capability in resolution extrapolation,high-resolution editing, generating consistent 3D views, and synthesizingvideos with seamless transitions. We expect that the open-sourcing ofLumina-T2X will further foster creativity, transparency, and diversity in thegenerative AI community.</description><author>Peng Gao, Le Zhuo, Ziyi Lin, Chris Liu, Junsong Chen, Ruoyi Du, Enze Xie, Xu Luo, Longtian Qiu, Yuhang Zhang, Chen Lin, Rongjie Huang, Shijie Geng, Renrui Zhang, Junlin Xi, Wenqi Shao, Zhengkai Jiang, Tianshuo Yang, Weicai Ye, He Tong, Jingwen He, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 18:35:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05945v1</guid></item><item><title>MRISegmentator-Abdomen: A Fully Automated Multi-Organ and Structure Segmentation Tool for T1-weighted Abdominal MRI</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05944v1</link><description>Background: Segmentation of organs and structures in abdominal MRI is usefulfor many clinical applications, such as disease diagnosis and radiotherapy.Current approaches have focused on delineating a limited set of abdominalstructures (13 types). To date, there is no publicly available abdominal MRIdataset with voxel-level annotations of multiple organs and structures.Consequently, a segmentation tool for multi-structure segmentation is alsounavailable. Methods: We curated a T1-weighted abdominal MRI dataset consistingof 195 patients who underwent imaging at National Institutes of Health (NIH)Clinical Center. The dataset comprises of axial pre-contrast T1, arterial,venous, and delayed phases for each patient, thereby amounting to a total of780 series (69,248 2D slices). Each series contains voxel-level annotations of62 abdominal organs and structures. A 3D nnUNet model, dubbed asMRISegmentator-Abdomen (MRISegmentator in short), was trained on this dataset,and evaluation was conducted on an internal test set and two large externaldatasets: AMOS22 and Duke Liver. The predicted segmentations were comparedagainst the ground-truth using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) andNormalized Surface Distance (NSD). Findings: MRISegmentator achieved an averageDSC of 0.861$\pm$0.170 and a NSD of 0.924$\pm$0.163 in the internal test set.On the AMOS22 dataset, MRISegmentator attained an average DSC of0.829$\pm$0.133 and a NSD of 0.908$\pm$0.067. For the Duke Liver dataset, anaverage DSC of 0.933$\pm$0.015 and a NSD of 0.929$\pm$0.021 was obtained.Interpretation: The proposed MRISegmentator provides automatic, accurate, androbust segmentations of 62 organs and structures in T1-weighted abdominal MRIsequences. The tool has the potential to accelerate research on variousclinical topics, such as abnormality detection, radiotherapy, diseaseclassification among others.</description><author>Yan Zhuang, Tejas Sudharshan Mathai, Pritam Mukherjee, Brandon Khoury, Boah Kim, Benjamin Hou, Nusrat Rabbee, Ronald M.

We then employ these approaches to create SIMPLER, acollection of simulated environments for manipulation policy evaluation oncommon real robot setups. Through paired sim-and-real evaluations ofmanipulation policies, we demonstrate strong correlation between policyperformance in SIMPLER environments and in the real world. Additionally, wefind that SIMPLER evaluations accurately reflect real-world policy behaviormodes such as sensitivity to various distribution shifts.

Atthe same time, our NLP systems have become heavily reliant on LLMs, most ofwhich do not model authors. To build NLP systems that can truly understandhuman language, we must better integrate human contexts into LLMs. This bringsto the fore a range of design considerations and challenges in terms of whathuman aspects to capture, how to represent them, and what modeling strategiesto pursue. To address these, we advocate for three positions toward creatinglarge human language models (LHLMs) using concepts from psychological andbehavioral sciences: First, LM training should include the human context.Second, LHLMs should recognize that people are more than their group(s). Third,LHLMs should be able to account for the dynamic and temporally-dependent natureof the human context.

Thehigh-speed and extensive 6G technology is an ideal platform for providingpowerful AIGC mobile service applications, while future 6G mobile networks alsoneed to support intelligent and personalized mobile generation services.However, the significant ethical and security issues of current AIGC models,such as adversarial attacks, privacy, and fairness, greatly affect thecredibility of 6G intelligent networks, especially in ensuring secure, private,and fair AIGC applications. In this paper, we propose TrustGAIN, a novelparadigm for trustworthy AIGC in 6G networks, to ensure trustworthy large-scaleAIGC services in future 6G networks. We first discuss the adversarial attacksand privacy threats faced by AIGC systems in 6G networks, as well as thecorresponding protection issues. Subsequently, we emphasize the importance ofensuring the unbiasedness and fairness of the mobile generative service infuture intelligent networks. In particular, we conduct a use case todemonstrate that TrustGAIN can effectively guide the resistance againstmalicious or generated false information.

Constructing an ensembleprediction system (EPS) based on conventional numerical weather prediction(NWP) models is highly computationally expensive. Machine learning (ML) modelshave emerged as valuable tools for deterministic weather forecasts, providingforecasts with significantly reduced computational requirements and evensurpassing the forecast performance of traditional NWP models. However,challenges arise when applying ML models to ensemble forecasting. Recent MLmodels, such as GenCast and SEEDS model, rely on the ERA5 Ensemble of DataAssimilations (EDA) or two operational NWP ensemble members for forecastgeneration. The spatial resolution of 1{\deg} or 2{\deg} in these models isoften considered too coarse for many applications. To overcome theselimitations, we introduce FuXi-ENS, an advanced ML model designed to deliver6-hourly global ensemble weather forecasts up to 15 days. This model runs at asignificantly improved spatial resolution of 0.25{\deg}, incorporating 5upper-air atmospheric variables at 13 pressure levels, along with 13 surfacevariables. By leveraging the inherent probabilistic nature of VariationalAutoEncoder (VAE), FuXi-ENS optimizes a loss function that combines thecontinuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and the KL divergence between thepredicted and target distribution. This innovative approach represents anadvancement over the traditional use of L1 loss combined with the KL loss instandard VAE models when VAE for ensemble weather forecasts. Evaluation resultsdemonstrate that FuXi-ENS outperforms ensemble forecasts from the EuropeanCentre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), a world leading NWP model,on 98.1% of 360 variable and forecast lead time combinations on CRPS.</description><author>Xiaohui Zhong, Lei Chen, Hao Li, Jie Feng, Bo Lu</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 18:15:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05925v1</guid></item><item><title>Diag2Diag: Multi modal super resolution for physics discovery with application to fusion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05908v1</link><description>This paper introduces a groundbreaking multi-modal neural network modeldesigned for resolution enhancement, which innovatively leveragesinter-diagnostic correlations within a system.

However, when using pairwise comparisons torank a set of candidates the computational costs scale quadratically with thenumber of candidates, which can have practical limitations. This paperintroduces a Product of Expert (PoE) framework for efficient LLM ComparativeAssessment. Here individual comparisons are considered experts that provideinformation on a pair's score difference. The PoE framework combines theinformation from these experts to yield an expression that can be maximizedwith respect to the underlying set of candidates, and is highly flexible whereany form of expert can be assumed. When Gaussian experts are used one canderive simple closed-form solutions for the optimal candidate ranking, as wellas expressions for selecting which comparisons should be made to maximize theprobability of this ranking. Our approach enables efficient comparativeassessment, where by using only a small subset of the possible comparisons, onecan generate score predictions that correlate as well to human judgements asthe predictions when all comparisons are used. We evaluate the approach onmultiple NLG tasks and demonstrate that our framework can yield considerablecomputational savings when performing pairwise comparative assessment. When Nis large, with as few as 2% of comparisons the PoE solution can achieve similarperformance to when all comparisons are used.</description><author>Adian Liusie, Vatsal Raina, Yassir Fathullah, Mark Gales</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 17:45:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05894v1</guid></item><item><title>Safe Exploration Using Bayesian World Models and Log-Barrier Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05890v1</link><description>A major challenge in deploying reinforcement learning in online tasks isensuring that safety is maintained throughout the learning process.

However, this extra neural network prediction information ischallenging to scalably convey visually for arbitrary data sources undermultiple uncertainty contexts. To address these challenges, we presentScatterUQ, an interactive system that provides targeted visualizations to allowusers to better understand model performance in context-driven uncertaintysettings. ScatterUQ leverages recent advances in distance-aware neuralnetworks, together with dimensionality reduction techniques, to constructrobust, 2-D scatter plots explaining why a model predicts a test example to be(1) in-distribution and of a particular class, (2) in-distribution but unsureof the class, and (3) out-of-distribution. ML consumers and engineers canvisually compare the salient features of test samples with training examplesthrough the use of a ``hover callback'' to understand model uncertaintyperformance and decide follow up courses of action. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of ScatterUQ to explain model uncertainty for a multiclass imageclassification on a distance-aware neural network trained on Fashion-MNIST andtested on Fashion-MNIST (in distribution) and MNIST digits (out ofdistribution), as well as a deep learning model for a cyber dataset.

At testtime, the trained AE is expected to well reconstruct normal but to poorlyreconstruct anomalous data. However, contrary to the expectation, anomalousdata is often well reconstructed as well. In order to further separate thereconstruction quality between normal and anomalous data, we propose creatingpseudo anomalies from learned adaptive noise by exploiting the aforementionedweakness of AE, i.e., reconstructing anomalies too well. The generated noise isadded to the normal data to create pseudo anomalies.

Our methods are based on constructing a low-rankNystr\"om approximation to $A$ using sparse random sketching. Thisapproximation is used to construct a preconditioner, which itself is invertedquickly using additional levels of random sketching and preconditioning. Weprove that the convergence of our methods depends on a natural averagecondition number of $A$, which improves as the rank of the Nystr\"omapproximation increases. Concretely, this allows us to obtain faster runtimesfor a number of fundamental linear algebraic problems: 1. We show how to solve any $n\times n$ linear system that iswell-conditioned except for $k$ outlying large singular values in$\tilde{O}(n^{2.065} + k^\omega)$ time, improving on a recent result of[Derezi\'nski, Yang, STOC 2024] for all $k \gtrsim n^{0.78}$. 2. We give the first $\tilde{O}(n^2 + {d_\lambda}^{\omega}$) time algorithmfor solving a regularized linear system $(A + \lambda I)x = b$, where $A$ ispositive semidefinite with effective dimension $d_\lambda$. This problem arisesin applications like Gaussian process regression. 3. We give faster algorithms for approximating Schatten $p$-norms and othermatrix norms. For example, for the Schatten 1 (nuclear) norm, we give analgorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n^{2.11})$ time, improving on an$\tilde{O}(n^{2.18})$ method of [Musco et al., ITCS 2018].

In addition, DCF is not only capable offiguring out the optimal training strategy with the capability of avoidingoverfitting but also yields built-in quantitative and visual explanationsderived from the actual input and weights of the trained model. We validatedDCF's effectiveness through experiments with three convolutional neuralnetworks (ResNet18, ResNet34 and Inception-v3) on two temporally continuedcommercial product datasets. Results showed fine-tuning pathways outperformedtraining-from-scratch ones by up to 2.13% and 1.23% on the pre-existing and newdatasets, respectively, in terms of mean accuracy. Furthermore, DCF identifiedreflection padding as the superior padding method, enhancing testing accuracyby 3.72% on average. This framework stands out for its potential to guide thedevelopment of robust and explainable AI solutions in fine-grained visualclassification tasks.</description><author>Zheming Zuo, Joseph Smith, Jonathan Stonehouse, Boguslaw Obara</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 16:41:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05853v1</guid></item><item><title>Pre-trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Are Versatile Representation Learners for Control</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05852v1</link><description>Embodied AI agents require a fine-grained understanding of the physical worldmediated through visual and language inputs. Such capabilities are difficult tolearn solely from task-specific data. This has led to the emergence ofpre-trained vision-language models as a tool for transferring representationslearned from internet-scale data to downstream tasks and new domains. However,commonly used contrastively trained representations such as in CLIP have beenshown to fail at enabling embodied agents to gain a sufficiently fine-grainedscene understanding -- a capability vital for control. To address thisshortcoming, we consider representations from pre-trained text-to-imagediffusion models, which are explicitly optimized to generate images from textprompts and as such, contain text-conditioned representations that reflecthighly fine-grained visuo-spatial information. Using pre-trained text-to-imagediffusion models, we construct Stable Control Representations which allowlearning downstream control policies that generalize to complex, open-endedenvironments. We show that policies learned using Stable ControlRepresentations are competitive with state-of-the-art representation learningapproaches across a broad range of simulated control settings, encompassingchallenging manipulation and navigation tasks. Most notably, we show thatStable Control Representations enable learning policies that exhibitstate-of-the-art performance on OVMM, a difficult open-vocabulary navigationbenchmark.</description><author>Gunshi Gupta, Karmesh Yadav, Yarin Gal, Dhruv Batra, Zsolt Kira, Cong Lu, Tim G.

Both fields generally userepresentations as a means to understand or improve a system's computations. Inthis work, however, we explore surprising dissociations between representationand computation that may pose challenges for such efforts. We create datasetsin which we attempt to match the computational role that different featuresplay, while manipulating other properties of the features or the data. We trainvarious deep learning architectures to compute these multiple abstract featuresabout their inputs. We find that their learned feature representations aresystematically biased towards representing some features more strongly thanothers, depending upon extraneous properties such as feature complexity, theorder in which features are learned, and the distribution of features over theinputs. For example, features that are simpler to compute or learned first tendto be represented more strongly and densely than features that are more complexor learned later, even if all features are learned equally well. We alsoexplore how these biases are affected by architectures, optimizers, andtraining regimes (e.g., in transformers, features decoded earlier in the outputsequence also tend to be represented more strongly). Our results help tocharacterize the inductive biases of gradient-based representation learning.These results also highlight a key challenge for interpretability $-$ or forcomparing the representations of models and brains $-$ disentangling extraneousbiases from the computationally important aspects of a system's internalrepresentations.</description><author>Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Stephanie C.

However, it was shown thattext-to-image diffusion models are vulnerable to training image memorization,raising concerns on copyright infringement and privacy invasion. In this work,we perform practical analysis of memorization in text-to-image diffusionmodels. Targeting a set of images to protect, we conduct quantitive analysis onthem without need to collect any prompts. Specifically, we first formallydefine the memorization of image and identify three necessary conditions ofmemorization, respectively similarity, existence and probability. We thenreveal the correlation between the model's prediction error and imagereplication. Based on the correlation, we propose to utilize inversiontechniques to verify the safety of target images against memorization andmeasure the extent to which they are memorized. Model developers can utilizeour analysis method to discover memorized images or reliably claim safetyagainst memorization.

However, this approach can be time-consuming and heavilydependent on prior knowledge and experience. While numerous machine learningmodels have been developed to streamline this intensive and expert-driveniterative process, these methods typically demand extensive training data andconsiderable computational resources. Furthermore, methods based on deeplearning are usually restricted to the specific domains and tasks for whichthey were trained, limiting their applicability across different tasks. Thiscreates a trade-off between the efficiency of automation and the demand forresources. In this study, we present a novel approach that integratespre-trained LLMs with a FEM module. The FEM module evaluates each design andprovides essential feedback, guiding the LLMs to continuously learn, plan,generate, and optimize designs without the need for domain-specific training.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in managing theiterative optimization of truss structures, showcasing its capability to reasonabout and refine designs according to structured feedback and criteria. Ourresults reveal that these LLM-based agents can successfully generate trussdesigns that comply with natural language specifications with a success rate ofup to 90%, which varies according to the applied constraints. By employingprompt-based optimization techniques we show that LLM based agents exhibitoptimization behavior when provided with solution-score pairs to iterativelyrefine designs to meet specifications.

Yet, a notable challenge with existing convolutionalneural network (CNN)-based methods for data fidelity enhancement is theirreliance on specific low-fidelity data patterns and distributions during thetraining phase. In addition, the CNN-based method essentially treats the flowreconstruction task as a computer vision task that prioritizes the element-wiseprecision which lacks a physical and mathematical explanation. This dependencecan dramatically affect the models' effectiveness in real-world scenarios,especially when the low-fidelity input deviates from the training data orcontains noise not accounted for during training. The introduction of diffusionmodels in this context shows promise for improving performance andgeneralizability. Unlike direct mapping from a specific low-fidelity to ahigh-fidelity distribution, diffusion models learn to transition from anylow-fidelity distribution towards a high-fidelity one. Our proposed model -Physics-informed Residual Diffusion, demonstrates the capability to elevate thequality of data from both standard low-fidelity inputs, to low-fidelity inputswith injected Gaussian noise, and randomly collected samples. By integratingphysics-based insights into the objective function, it further refines theaccuracy and the fidelity of the inferred high-quality data.

Previous studiesprimarily focus on local visual representation by leveraging mask imagemodeling or sequence contrastive learning. However, they omit modeling thelinguistic information in text images, which is crucial for recognizing text.To simultaneously capture local character features and linguistic informationin visual space, we propose Symmetric Superimposition Modeling (SSM). Theobjective of SSM is to reconstruct the direction-specific pixel and featuresignals from the symmetrically superimposed input. Specifically, we add theoriginal image with its inverted views to create the symmetrically superimposedinputs. At the pixel level, we reconstruct the original and inverted images tocapture character shapes and texture-level linguistic context. At the featurelevel, we reconstruct the feature of the same original image and inverted imagewith different augmentations to model the semantic-level linguistic context andthe local character discrimination. In our design, we disrupt the charactershape and linguistic rules. Consequently, the dual-level reconstructionfacilitates understanding character shapes and linguistic information from theperspective of visual texture and feature semantics.

Open set recognition (OSR) aims to bringclassification tasks in a situation that is more like reality, which focuses onclassifying the known classes as well as handling unknown classes effectively.In such an open-set problem the gathered samples in the training set cannotencompass all the classes and the system needs to identify unknown samples attest time. On the other hand, building an accurate and comprehensive model in areal dynamic environment presents a number of obstacles, because it isprohibitively expensive to train for every possible example of unknown items,and the model may fail when tested in testbeds.

This makes characterizing their time complexity challenging,particularly when we wish to make comparisons between deterministic andstochastic methods, that may or may not rely on preconditioning and/or fastmatrix multiplication. In this work, we consider a fine-grained notion ofcomplexity for iterative linear solvers which we call the spectral tailcondition number, $\kappa_\ell$, defined as the ratio between the $\ell$thlargest and the smallest singular value of the matrix representing the system. Concretely, we prove the following main algorithmic result: Given an $n\timesn$ matrix $A$ and a vector $b$, we can find $\tilde{x}$ such that$\|A\tilde{x}-b\|\leq\epsilon\|b\|$ in time $\tilde{O}(\kappa_\ell\cdot n^2\log1/\epsilon)$ for any $\ell = O(n^{\frac1{\omega-1}})=O(n^{0.729})$, where$\omega \approx 2.372$ is the current fast matrix multiplication exponent. Thisguarantee is achieved by Sketch-and-Project with Nesterov's acceleration. Someof the implications of our result, and of the use of $\kappa_\ell$, includedirect improvement over a fine-grained analysis of the Conjugate Gradientmethod, suggesting a stronger separation between deterministic and stochasticiterative solvers; and relating the complexity of iterative solvers to theongoing algorithmic advances in fast matrix multiplication, since the bound on$\ell$ improves with $\omega$.

However, existingmethods depend on long-time training or fine-tuning, which prevents large-scaleapplications. Recently, some works focusing on post-training sparsity (PTS)have emerged. They get rid of the high training cost but usually suffer fromdistinct accuracy degradation due to neglect of the reasonable sparsity rate ateach layer. Previous methods for finding sparsity rates mainly focus on thetraining-aware scenario, which usually fails to converge stably under the PTSsetting with limited data and much less training cost. In this paper, wepropose a fast and controllable post-training sparsity (FCPTS) framework.

Despite promising identityfidelity has been achieved by several tuning-free methods, they usually sufferfrom overfitting issues. The learned identity tends to entangle with irrelevantinformation, resulting in unsatisfied text controllability, especially onfaces. In this work, we present MasterWeaver, a test-time tuning-free methoddesigned to generate personalized images with both faithful identity fidelityand flexible editability. Specifically, MasterWeaver adopts an encoder toextract identity features and steers the image generation through additionalintroduced cross attention. To improve editability while maintaining identityfidelity, we propose an editing direction loss for training, which aligns theediting directions of our MasterWeaver with those of the original T2I model.Additionally, a face-augmented dataset is constructed to facilitatedisentangled identity learning, and further improve the editability. Extensiveexperiments demonstrate that our MasterWeaver can not only generatepersonalized images with faithful identity, but also exhibit superiority intext controllability.

Throughmathematical analysis, we prove that the use of symmetric losses, such as theMean Squared Error (MSE), leads to biased predictions and underestimation ofextreme values. To address this issue, we introduce Exloss, a novel lossfunction that performs asymmetric optimization and highlights extreme values toobtain accurate extreme weather forecast. Furthermore, we introduce atraining-free extreme value enhancement strategy named ExEnsemble, whichincreases the variance of pixel values and improves the forecast robustness.Combined with an advanced global weather forecast model, extensive experimentsshow that our solution can achieve state-of-the-art performance in extremeweather prediction, while maintaining the overall forecast accuracy comparableto the top medium-range forecast models.</description><author>Wanghan Xu, Kang Chen, Tao Han, Hao Chen, Wanli Ouyang, Lei Bai</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 15:40:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01295v3</guid></item><item><title>Boosting Multimodal Large Language Models with Visual Tokens Withdrawal for Rapid Inference</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05803v1</link><description>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demand considerable computations forinference due to the extensive parameters and the additional input tokensneeded for visual information representation. Herein, we introduce VisualTokens Withdrawal (VTW), a plug-and-play module to boost MLLMs for rapidinference. Our approach is inspired by two intriguing phenomena we haveobserved: (1) the attention sink phenomenon that is prevalent in LLMs alsopersists in MLLMs, suggesting that initial tokens and nearest tokens receivethe majority of attention, while middle vision tokens garner minimal attentionin deep layers; (2) the presence of information migration, which implies thatvisual information is transferred to subsequent text tokens within the firstfew layers of MLLMs. As per our findings, we conclude that vision tokens arenot necessary in the deep layers of MLLMs. Thus, we strategically withdraw themat a certain layer, enabling only text tokens to engage in subsequent layers.To pinpoint the ideal layer for vision tokens withdrawal, we initially analyzea limited set of tiny datasets and choose the first layer that meets theKullback-Leibler divergence criterion. Our VTW approach can cut computationaloverhead by over 40\% across diverse multimodal tasks while maintainingperformance.

However, information exchanges among neighbor nodesin GNN pose new challenges in the resource-constrained scenario, especially inwireless systems. In practical wireless systems, the communication links amongnodes are usually unreliable due to wireless fading and receiver noise,consequently resulting in performance degradation of GNNs. To improve thelearning performance of GNNs, we aim to maximize the number of long-termaverage (LTA) communication links by the optimized power control under energyconsumption constraints. Using the Lyapunov optimization method, we firsttransform the intractable long-term problem into a deterministic problem ineach time slot by converting the long-term energy constraints into theobjective function. In spite of this non-convex combinatorial optimizationproblem, we address this problem via equivalently solving a sequence of convexfeasibility problems together with a greedy based solver.

Single-shot graspplanning invariably fails in such scenarios. Instead, it is necessary to firstmanipulate the object into a configuration that affords a grasp. We solve thisproblem by learning a sequence of actions that utilize the environment tochange the object's pose. Concretely, we employ hierarchical reinforcementlearning to combine a sequence of learned parameterized manipulationprimitives. By learning the low-level manipulation policies, our approach cancontrol the object's state through exploiting interactions between the object,the gripper, and the environment. Designing such a complex behavioranalytically would be infeasible under uncontrolled conditions, as an analyticapproach requires accurate physical modeling of the interaction and contactdynamics. In contrast, we learn a hierarchical policy model that operatesdirectly on depth perception data, without the need for object detection, poseestimation, or manual design of controllers. We evaluate our approach onpicking box-shaped objects of various weight, shape, and friction propertiesfrom a constrained table-top workspace. Our method transfers to a real robotand is able to successfully complete the object picking task in 98\% ofexperimental trials.

Unfortunately, many people at riskfor suicide do not receive the support required. Barriers to people receivingsupport include social stigma and lack of access to mental health care. Withthe popularity of social media, people have turned to online forums, such asReddit to express their feelings and seek support. This provides theopportunity to support people with the aid of artificial intelligence. Socialmedia posts can be classified, using text classification, to help connectpeople with professional help. However, these systems fail to account for theinherent uncertainty in classifying mental health conditions. Unlike otherareas of healthcare, mental health conditions have no objective measurements ofdisease often relying on expert opinion. Thus when formulating deep learningproblems involving mental health, using hard, binary labels does not accuratelyrepresent the true nature of the data. In these settings, where human expertsmay disagree, fuzzy or soft labels may be more appropriate. The current workintroduces a novel label smoothing method which we use to capture anyuncertainty within the data. We test our approach on a five-label multi-classclassification problem. We show, our semi-supervised deep label smoothingmethod improves classification accuracy above the existing state of the art.Where existing research reports an accuracy of 43\% on the Reddit C-SSRSdataset, using empirical experiments to evaluate our novel label smoothingmethod, we improve upon this existing benchmark to 52\%. These improvements inmodel performance have the potential to better support those experiencingmental distress.

Ideally, the system should be able to handleany object and not be restricted to segmenting a limited set of object classes,especially in robotic applications. Addressing this need, we introduce adiffusion model with cumulative occlusion learning designed for sequentialamodal segmentation of objects with uncertain categories. This modeliteratively refines the prediction using the cumulative mask strategy duringdiffusion, effectively capturing the uncertainty of invisible regions andadeptly reproducing the complex distribution of shapes and occlusion orders ofoccluded objects. It is akin to the human capability for amodal perception,i.e., to decipher the spatial ordering among objects and accurately predictcomplete contours for occluded objects in densely layered visual scenes.Experimental results across three amodal datasets show that our methodoutperforms established baselines.</description><author>Jiayang Ao, Qiuhong Ke, Krista A.

In this paper, wepropose a novel topological representation of an environment based on "imagesegments", which are semantically meaningful and open-vocabulary queryable,conferring several advantages over previous works based on pixel-levelfeatures. Unlike 3D scene graphs, we create a purely topological graph withsegments as nodes, where edges are formed by a) associating segment-leveldescriptors between pairs of consecutive images and b) connecting neighboringsegments within an image using their pixel centroids. This unveils a"continuous sense of a place", defined by inter-image persistence of segmentsalong with their intra-image neighbours. It further enables us to represent andupdate segment-level descriptors through neighborhood aggregation using graphconvolution layers, which improves robot localization based on segment-levelretrieval. Using real-world data, we show how our proposed map representationcan be used to i) generate navigation plans in the form of "hops over segments"and ii) search for target objects using natural language queries describingspatial relations of objects. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze dataassociation at the segment level, which underpins inter-image connectivityduring mapping and segment-level localization when revisiting the same place.Finally, we show preliminary trials on segment-level `hopping' based zero-shotreal-world navigation.

Methods: We first assume that the true lead field matrix is atransformation of the existing lead field matrix distorted by uncertainties andpropose an iterative approach to estimate this transformation accurately. Majorsources of the forward model uncertainties, including differences in geometry,conductivity, and source space resolution between the real and simulated headmodels, and misaligned electrode positions, are then simulated to test theproposed method. Results: ReLORETA and eLORETA are applied to simulated focalsources in different regions of the brain and the presence of various noiselevels as well as real data from a patient with focal epilepsy. The resultsshow that ReLORETA is considerably more robust and accurate than eLORETA in allcases. Conclusion: Having successfully dealt with the forward modeluncertainties, ReLORETA proved to be a promising method for real-world clinicalapplications. Significance: eLORETA is one of the localization techniques thatcould be used to study brain activity for medical applications such asdetermining the epileptogenic zone in patients with medically refractoryepilepsy. However, the major limitation of eLORETA is sensitivity to theuncertainties in the forward model. Since this problem can substantiallyundermine its performance in real-world applications where the exact lead fieldmatrix is unknown, developing a more robust method capable of dealing withthese uncertainties is of significant interest.</description><author>A.

The self-decoder efficiently encodesglobal key-value (KV) caches that are reused by the cross-decoder viacross-attention. The overall model behaves like a decoder-only Transformer,although YOCO only caches once. The design substantially reduces GPU memorydemands, yet retains global attention capability. Additionally, the computationflow enables prefilling to early exit without changing the final output,thereby significantly speeding up the prefill stage. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that YOCO achieves favorable performance compared to Transformer invarious settings of scaling up model size and number of training tokens. Wealso extend YOCO to 1M context length with near-perfect needle retrievalaccuracy.

However,most methods do not include spatial interactions. A few methods have low-orderspatial interactions, but achieving a good balance between accuracy andcomplexity is challenging. To address the above problems, a dual-residualspatial interaction network (DRSI-Net) for MPPE with high accuracy and lowcomplexity is proposed herein. Compared to other methods, DRSI-Net recursivelyperforms residual spatial information interactions on the neighbouring featuresso that more useful spatial information can be retained and more similaritiescan be obtained between shallow and deep extracted features. The channel andspatial dual attention mechanism introduced in the multi-scale feature fusionalso helps the network to adaptively focus on features relevant to the targetkey points and further refine the generated poses. Simultaneously, byoptimising the interactive channel dimensions and dividing the gradient flow,the spatial interaction module is designed to be lightweight, thus reducing thecomplexity of the network.

Urban transportation complexity arises from thespatiotemporal interactions among various traffic modes. Motivated by analyzingmultimodal data from Shenzhen, a framework that can dissect complicatedspatiotemporal interactions between these modes, from the microscopic locallevel to the macroscopic city-wide perspective, is essential. The frameworkcontains three core components: the Intra-modal Learning Module, theInter-modal Learning Module, and the Prediction Decoder. The Intra-modalLearning Module is designed to analyze spatial dependencies within individualtransportation modes, facilitating a granular understanding of single-modespatiotemporal dynamics. The Inter-modal Learning Module extends this analysis,integrating data across different modes to uncover cross-modalinterdependencies, by breaking down the interactions at both local and globalscales. Finally, the Prediction Decoder synthesizes insights from the precedingmodules to generate accurate OD flow predictions, translating complexmultimodal interactions into forecasts. Empirical evaluations conducted inmetropolitan contexts, including Shenzhen and New York, demonstrateFusionTransNet's superior predictive accuracy compared to existingstate-of-the-art methods.

Typically, GNNs can be implementedin two settings, including the transductive setting and the inductive setting.In the transductive setting, the trained model can only predict the labels ofnodes that were observed at the training time. In the inductive setting, thetrained model can be generalized to new nodes/graphs. Due to its flexibility,the inductive setting is the most popular GNN setting at the moment. Previouswork has shown that transductive GNNs are vulnerable to a series of privacyattacks. However, a comprehensive privacy analysis of inductive GNN models isstill missing. This paper fills the gap by conducting a systematic privacyanalysis of inductive GNNs through the lens of link stealing attacks, one ofthe most popular attacks that are specifically designed for GNNs. We proposetwo types of link stealing attacks, i.e., posterior-only attacks and combinedattacks. We define threat models of the posterior-only attacks with respect tonode topology and the combined attacks by considering combinations ofposteriors, node attributes, and graph features. Extensive evaluation on sixreal-world datasets demonstrates that inductive GNNs leak rich information thatenables link stealing attacks with advantageous properties. Even attacks withno knowledge about graph structures can be effective. We also show that ourattacks are robust to different node similarities and different graph features.As a counterpart, we investigate two possible defenses and discover they areineffective against our attacks, which calls for more effective defenses.</description><author>Yixin Wu, Xinlei He, Pascal Berrang, Mathias Humbert, Michael Backes, Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Yang Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 15:03:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05784v1</guid></item><item><title>Neural Network Learning of Black-Scholes Equation for Option Pricing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05780v1</link><description>One of the most discussed problems in the financial world is stock optionpricing.

ULR languages are those for which theamount of available textual resources is very low, and the speaker count forthem is also very low. ULRLs are also not supported by mainstream LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, due to which gathering artificial trainingdata for them becomes even more challenging. Mainstream AI foundational modeldevelopment has given less attention to this category of languages. Generally,these languages have very few speakers, making it hard to find them. However,it is important to develop foundational models for these ULR languages topromote inclusion and the tangible abilities and impact of LLMs. To this end,we have compiled the available S\'ami language resources from the web to createa clean dataset for training language models. In order to study the behavior ofmodern LLM models with ULR languages (S\'ami), we have experimented withdifferent kinds of LLMs, mainly at the order of $\sim$ seven billionparameters.

We investigate this comparisonfrom the novel perspective of the predictions of state-of-the-art largelanguage models, using the same experimental paradigms as recent studiesinvestigating the same inferences with humans. The results of our bestperforming models mostly align with those of humans, both in the largedifferences we find between those inferences and implicatures, as well as infine-grained distinctions among different aspects of those inferences.</description><author>Polina Tsvilodub, Paul Marty, Sonia Ramotowska, Jacopo Romoli, Michael Franke</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 14:54:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05776v1</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Text-Guided Single Image Editing for Remote Sensing Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05769v1</link><description>Artificial Intelligence Generative Content (AIGC) technologies havesignificantly influenced the remote sensing domain, particularly in the realmof image generation. However, remote sensing image editing, an equally vitalresearch area, has not garnered sufficient attention. Different fromtext-guided editing in natural images, which relies on extensive text-imagepaired data for semantic correlation, the application scenarios of remotesensing image editing are often extreme, such as forest on fire, so it isdifficult to obtain sufficient paired samples. At the same time, the lack ofremote sensing semantics and the ambiguity of text also restrict the furtherapplication of image editing in remote sensing field. To solve above problems,this letter proposes a diffusion based method to fulfill stable andcontrollable remote sensing image editing with text guidance. Our method avoidsthe use of a large number of paired image, and can achieve good image editingresults using only a single image. The quantitative evaluation system includingCLIP score and subjective evaluation metrics shows that our method has betterediting effect on remote sensing images than the existing image editing model.</description><author>Fangzhou Han, Lingyu Si, Hongwei Dong, Lamei Zhang, Hao Chen, Bo Du</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 14:45:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05769v1</guid></item><item><title>FastScene: Text-Driven Fast 3D Indoor Scene Generation via Panoramic Gaussian Splatting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05768v1</link><description>Text-driven 3D indoor scene generation holds broad applications, ranging fromgaming and smart homes to AR/VR applications. Fast and high-fidelity scenegeneration is paramount for ensuring user-friendly experiences. However,existing methods are characterized by lengthy generation processes ornecessitate the intricate manual specification of motion parameters, whichintroduces inconvenience for users. Furthermore, these methods often rely onnarrow-field viewpoint iterative generations, compromising global consistencyand overall scene quality. To address these issues, we propose FastScene, aframework for fast and higher-quality 3D scene generation, while maintainingthe scene consistency. Specifically, given a text prompt, we generate apanorama and estimate its depth, since the panorama encompasses informationabout the entire scene and exhibits explicit geometric constraints. To obtainhigh-quality novel views, we introduce the Coarse View Synthesis (CVS) andProgressive Novel View Inpainting (PNVI) strategies, ensuring both sceneconsistency and view quality. Subsequently, we utilize Multi-View Projection(MVP) to form perspective views, and apply 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) forscene reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate FastScene surpassesother methods in both generation speed and quality with better sceneconsistency. Notably, guided only by a text prompt, FastScene can generate a 3Dscene within a mere 15 minutes, which is at least one hour faster thanstate-of-the-art methods, making it a paradigm for user-friendly scenegeneration.</description><author>Yikun Ma, Dandan Zhan, Zhi Jin</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 14:44:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05768v1</guid></item><item><title>Large Language Model-Aided Evolutionary Search for Constrained Multiobjective Optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05767v1</link><description>Evolutionary algorithms excel in solving complex optimization problems,especially those with multiple objectives. However, their stochastic nature cansometimes hinder rapid convergence to the global optima, particularly inscenarios involving constraints. In this study, we employ a large languagemodel (LLM) to enhance evolutionary search for solving constrainedmulti-objective optimization problems. Our aim is to speed up the convergenceof the evolutionary population. To achieve this, we finetune the LLM throughtailored prompt engineering, integrating information concerning both objectivevalues and constraint violations of solutions. This process enables the LLM tograsp the relationship between well-performing and poorly performing solutionsbased on the provided input data. Solution's quality is assessed based on theirconstraint violations and objective-based performance. By leveraging therefined LLM, it can be used as a search operator to generate superior-qualitysolutions. Experimental evaluations across various test benchmarks illustratethat LLM-aided evolutionary search can significantly accelerate thepopulation's convergence speed and stands out competitively againstcutting-edge evolutionary algorithms.</description><author>Zeyi Wang, Songbai Liu, Jianyong Chen, Kay Chen Tan</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 14:44:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05767v1</guid></item><item><title>To Trust or Not to Trust: Towards a novel approach to measure trust for XAI systems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05766v1</link><description>The increasing reliance on Deep Learning models, combined with their inherentlack of transparency, has spurred the development of a novel field of studyknown as eXplainable AI (XAI) methods.

Moreover, virtual binary modal masks areutilized to refine the range of values in k-space data through highly adaptivecenter windows, which allows the model to focus its attention more efficiently.Last but not least, an inverted pyramid structure is employed, where thetop-down image information gradually decreases, ena-bling a cascaderepresentation.

Existing methods suffer frominsufficient feature representations and fail to consider the comprehensiveintegration of similarity at different granularities, making it difficult tofilter out noise and irrelevant information. To address these challenges, wepropose a Similarity-Guided Multimodal Fusion Transformer (SG-MFT) forpredicting social users' semantic locations. First, we utilize a pre-trainedlarge-scale vision-language model to extract high-quality featurerepresentations from social media posts. Then, we introduce a Similarity-GuidedInteraction Module (SIM) to alleviate modality heterogeneity and noiseinterference by incorporating coarse-grained and fine-grained similarityguidance for modality interactions. Specifically, we propose a novelsimilarity-aware feature interpolation attention mechanism at the coarse level,leveraging modality-wise similarity to mitigate heterogeneity and reduce noisewithin each modality. Meanwhile, we employ a similarity-aware feed-forwardblock at the fine level, utilizing element-wise similarity to further mitigatethe impact of modality heterogeneity. Building upon pre-processed features withminimal noise and modal interference, we propose a Similarity-aware FeatureFusion Module (SFM) to fuse two modalities with cross-attention mechanism.Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of ourproposed method in handling modality imbalance while maintaining efficientfusion effectiveness.</description><author>Zhizhen Zhang, Ning Wang, Haojie Li, Zhihui Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 14:32:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05760v1</guid></item><item><title>DGMamba: Domain Generalization via Generalized State Space Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07794v2</link><description>Domain generalization~(DG) aims at solving distribution shift problems invarious scenes. Existing approaches are based on Convolution Neural Networks(CNNs) or Vision Transformers (ViTs), which suffer from limited receptivefields or quadratic complexities issues. Mamba, as an emerging state spacemodel (SSM), possesses superior linear complexity and global receptive fields.Despite this, it can hardly be applied to DG to address distribution shifts,due to the hidden state issues and inappropriate scan mechanisms. In thispaper, we propose a novel framework for DG, named DGMamba, that excels instrong generalizability toward unseen domains and meanwhile has the advantagesof global receptive fields, and efficient linear complexity. Our DGMambacompromises two core components: Hidden State Suppressing~(HSS) andSemantic-aware Patch refining~(SPR). In particular, HSS is introduced tomitigate the influence of hidden states associated with domain-specificfeatures during output prediction. SPR strives to encourage the model toconcentrate more on objects rather than context, consisting of two designs:Prior-Free Scanning~(PFS), and Domain Context Interchange~(DCI). Concretely,PFS aims to shuffle the non-semantic patches within images, creating moreflexible and effective sequences from images, and DCI is designed to regularizeMamba with the combination of mismatched non-semantic and semantic informationby fusing patches among domains. Extensive experiments on four commonly used DGbenchmarks demonstrate that the proposed DGMamba achieves remarkably superiorresults to state-of-the-art models.

However, current attention paradigms fail to infer anoptimal channel descriptor capable of simultaneously exploiting statistical andspatial relationships among feature maps. In this paper, to overcome thisshortcoming, we present a novel channel-wise spatially autocorrelated (CSA)attention mechanism. Inspired by geographical analysis, the proposed CSAexploits the spatial relationships between channels of feature maps to producean effective channel descriptor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the concept of geographical spatial analysis is utilized in deepCNNs. The proposed CSA imposes negligible learning parameters and lightcomputational overhead to the deep model, making it a powerful yet efficientattention module of choice. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed CSAnetworks (CSA-Nets) through extensive experiments and analysis on ImageNet, andMS COCO benchmark datasets for image classification, object detection, andinstance segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that CSA-Nets areable to consistently achieve competitive performance and superiorgeneralization than several state-of-the-art attention-based CNNs overdifferent benchmark tasks and datasets.</description><author>Nick, Nikzad, Yongsheng Gao, Jun Zhou</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 14:21:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05755v1</guid></item><item><title>Behavioural Rehearsing Illuminates Scientific Problems of Organised Complexity</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09851v3</link><description>As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly prevalent in scientificresearch, data-driven methodologies appear to overshadow traditional methods inresolving scientific problems.

Weobserve that the strengths of new paradigms have expanded the range ofresolvable scientific problems, but the continued advancement of data,algorithms, and computational power is unlikely to bring a new paradigm. Totackle unresolved problems of organised complexity in more intricate systems,we argue that the integration of paradigms is a promising approach.Consequently, we propose behavioural rehearsing, checking what will happen insuch systems through multiple times of simulation. One of the methodologies torealise it, sophisticated behavioural simulation (SBS), represents a higherlevel of paradigms integration based on foundational models to simulate complexsocial systems involving sophisticated human strategies and behaviours.

Unfortunately, this NeRF-basedapproach typically requires a large number of paired audio-visual data for eachidentity, thereby limiting the scalability of the method. Although there havebeen attempts to generate audio-driven 3D talking head animations with a singleimage, the results are often unsatisfactory due to insufficient information onobscured regions in the image. In this paper, we mainly focus on addressing theoverlooked aspect of 3D consistency in the one-shot, audio-driven domain, wherefacial animations are synthesized primarily in front-facing perspectives. Wepropose a novel method, NeRFFaceSpeech, which enables to produce high-quality3D-aware talking head. Using prior knowledge of generative models combined withNeRF, our method can craft a 3D-consistent facial feature space correspondingto a single image. Our spatial synchronization method employs audio-correlatedvertex dynamics of a parametric face model to transform static image featuresinto dynamic visuals through ray deformation, ensuring realistic 3D facialmotion.

At present, Masked Image Modeling (MIM)pretraining model has been initially applied in PCB CT image elementsegmentation.

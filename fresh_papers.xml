We take one step to address this challenge byturning to a new task: focusing on symbolic graphics programs, which are apopular representation for graphics content that procedurally generates visualdata. LLMs have shown exciting promise towards program synthesis, but do theyunderstand symbolic graphics programs? Unlike conventional programs, symbolicgraphics programs can be translated to graphics content. Here, we characterizean LLM's understanding of symbolic programs in terms of their ability to answerquestions related to the graphics content. This task is challenging as thequestions are difficult to answer from the symbolic programs alone -- yet, theywould be easy to answer from the corresponding graphics content as we verifythrough a human experiment. To understand symbolic programs, LLMs may need topossess the ability to imagine how the corresponding graphics content wouldlook without directly accessing the rendered visual content. We use this taskto evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic understandingof symbolic graphics programs. This benchmark is built via program-graphicscorrespondence, hence requiring minimal human efforts. We evaluate current LLMson our benchmark to elucidate a preliminary assessment of their ability toreason about visual scenes from programs. We find that this task distinguishesexisting LLMs and models considered good at reasoning perform better. Lastly,we introduce Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT) to improve this ability.Specifically, we query GPT4-o with questions and images generated by symbolicprograms. Such data are then used to finetune an LLM. We also find that SITdata can improve the general instruction following ability of LLMs.</description><author>Zeju Qiu, Weiyang Liu, Haiwen Feng, Zhen Liu, Tim Z. Xiao, Katherine M.

Taxel-based tactile signals often have lowspatial-resolution, with non-standardized representations. In this paper, wepropose a novel framework, HyperTaxel, for learning a geometrically-informedrepresentation of taxel-based tactile signals to address challenges associatedwith their spatial resolution. We use this representation and a contrastivelearning objective to encode and map sparse low-resolution taxel signals tohigh-resolution contact surfaces. To address the uncertainty inherent in thesesignals, we leverage joint probability distributions across multiplesimultaneous contacts to improve taxel hyper-resolution. We evaluate ourrepresentation by comparing it with two baselines and present results thatsuggest our representation outperforms the baselines. Furthermore, we presentqualitative results that demonstrate the learned representation captures thegeometric features of the contact surface, such as flatness, curvature, andedges, and generalizes across different objects and sensor configurations.Moreover, we present results that suggest our representation improves theperformance of various downstream tasks, such as surface classification, 6Din-hand pose estimation, and sim-to-real transfer.</description><author>Hongyu Li, Snehal Dikhale, Jinda Cui, Soshi Iba, Nawid Jamali</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 17:59:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08312v1</guid></item><item><title>ScalingFilter: Assessing Data Quality through Inverse Utilization of Scaling Laws</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08310v1</link><description>High-quality data is crucial for the pre-training performance of largelanguage models. Unfortunately, existing quality filtering methods rely on aknown high-quality dataset as reference, which can introduce potential bias andcompromise diversity. In this paper, we propose ScalingFilter, a novel approachthat evaluates text quality based on the perplexity difference between twolanguage models trained on the same data, thereby eliminating the influence ofthe reference dataset in the filtering process. An theoretical analysis showsthat ScalingFilter is equivalent to an inverse utilization of scaling laws.Through training models with 1.3B parameters on the same data source processedby various quality filters, we find ScalingFilter can improve zero-shotperformance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. To assess the biasintroduced by quality filtering, we introduce semantic diversity, a metric ofutilizing text embedding models for semantic representations. Extensiveexperiments reveal that semantic diversity is a reliable indicator of datasetdiversity, and ScalingFilter achieves an optimal balance between downstreamperformance and semantic diversity.</description><author>Ruihang Li, Yixuan Wei, Miaosen Zhang, Nenghai Yu, Han Hu, Houwen Peng</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 17:59:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08310v1</guid></item><item><title>Understanding the Local Geometry of Generative Model Manifolds</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08307v1</link><description>Deep generative models learn continuous representations of complex datamanifolds using a finite number of samples during training. For a pre-trainedgenerative model, the common way to evaluate the quality of the manifoldrepresentation learned, is by computing global metrics like Fr\'echet InceptionDistance using a large number of generated and real samples. However,generative model performance is not uniform across the learned manifold, e.g.,for \textit{foundation models} like Stable Diffusion generation performance canvary significantly based on the conditioning or initial noise vector beingdenoised. In this paper we study the relationship between the \textit{localgeometry of the learned manifold} and downstream generation. Based on thetheory of continuous piecewise-linear (CPWL) generators, we use three geometricdescriptors - scaling ($\psi$), rank ($\nu$), and complexity ($\delta$) - tocharacterize a pre-trained generative model manifold locally. We providequantitative and qualitative evidence showing that for a given latent, thelocal descriptors are correlated with generation aesthetics, artifacts,uncertainty, and even memorization. Finally we demonstrate that training a\textit{reward model} on the local geometry can allow controlling thelikelihood of a generated sample under the learned distribution.</description><author>Ahmed Imtiaz Humayun, Ibtihel Amara, Candice Schumann, Golnoosh Farnadi, Negar Rostamzadeh, Mohammad Havaei</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 17:59:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08307v1</guid></item><item><title>On Model Compression for Neural Networks: Framework, Algorithm, and Convergence Guarantee</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06815v3</link><description>Model compression is a crucial part of deploying neural networks (NNs),especially when the memory and storage of computing devices are limited in manyapplications. This paper focuses on two model compression techniques: low-rankapproximation and weight pruning in neural networks, which are very popularnowadays. However, training NN with low-rank approximation and weight pruningalways suffers significant accuracy loss and convergence issues. In this paper,a holistic framework is proposed for model compression from a novel perspectiveof nonconvex optimization by designing an appropriate objective function. Then,we introduce NN-BCD, a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to solve thenonconvex optimization. One advantage of our algorithm is that an efficientiteration scheme can be derived with closed-form, which is gradient-free.Therefore, our algorithm will not suffer from vanishing/exploding gradientproblems. Furthermore, with the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (K{\L}) property of ourobjective function, we show that our algorithm globally converges to a criticalpoint at the rate of O(1/k), where k denotes the number of iterations. Lastly,extensive experiments with tensor train decomposition and weight pruningdemonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of the proposed framework.Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ChenyangLi-97/NN-BCD</description><author>Chenyang Li, Jihoon Chung, Mengnan Du, Haimin Wang, Xianlian Zhou, Bo Shen</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 17:58:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06815v3</guid></item><item><title>Towards Flexible Visual Relationship Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08305v1</link><description>Visual relationship understanding has been studied separately in human-objectinteraction(HOI) detection, scene graph generation(SGG), and referringrelationships(RR) tasks. Given the complexity and interconnectedness of thesetasks, it is crucial to have a flexible framework that can effectively addressthese tasks in a cohesive manner. In this work, we propose FleVRS, a singlemodel that seamlessly integrates the above three aspects in standard andpromptable visual relationship segmentation, and further possesses thecapability for open-vocabulary segmentation to adapt to novel scenarios. FleVRSleverages the synergy between text and image modalities, to ground varioustypes of relationships from images and use textual features fromvision-language models to visual conceptual understanding. Empirical validationacross various datasets demonstrates that our framework outperforms existingmodels in standard, promptable, and open-vocabulary tasks, e.g., +1.9 $mAP$ onHICO-DET, +11.4 $Acc$ on VRD, +4.7 $mAP$ on unseen HICO-DET. Our FleVRSrepresents a significant step towards a more intuitive, comprehensive, andscalable understanding of visual relationships.</description><author>Fangrui Zhu, Jianwei Yang, Huaizu Jiang</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 17:57:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08305v1</guid></item><item><title>Benchmarking the Capabilities of Large Language Models in Transportation System Engineering: Accuracy, Consistency, and Reasoning Behaviors</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08302v1</link><description>In this paper, we explore the capabilities of state-of-the-art large languagemodels (LLMs) such as GPT-4, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini1.5 Pro, Llama 3, and Llama 3.1 in solving some selected undergraduate-leveltransportation engineering problems.

Log parsing, which converts semi-structured log messagesinto structured templates, is a prerequisite for automated log analysis taskssuch as anomaly detection, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis. However,existing log parsers fail in real-world systems for three main reasons. First,traditional heuristics-based parsers require handcrafted features and domainknowledge, which are difficult to generalize at scale. Second, existing largelanguage model-based parsers rely on periodic offline processing, limitingtheir effectiveness in real-time use cases. Third, existing online parsingalgorithms are susceptible to log drift, where slight log changes create falsepositives that drown out real anomalies. To address these challenges, wepropose HELP, a Hierarchical Embeddings-based Log Parser. HELP is the firstonline semantic-based parser to leverage LLMs for performant and cost-effectivelog parsing. We achieve this through a novel hierarchical embeddings module,which fine-tunes a text embedding model to cluster logs before parsing,reducing querying costs by multiple orders of magnitude. To combat log drift,we also develop an iterative rebalancing module, which periodically updatesexisting log groupings. We evaluate HELP extensively on 14 public large-scaledatasets, showing that HELP achieves significantly higher F1-weighted groupingand parsing accuracy than current state-of-the-art online log parsers. We alsoimplement HELP into Iudex's production observability platform, confirmingHELP's practicality in a production environment. Our results show that HELP iseffective and efficient for high-throughput real-world log parsing.</description><author>Andy Xu, Arno Gau</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 17:54:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08300v1</guid></item><item><title>SLCA++: Unleash the Power of Sequential Fine-tuning for Continual Learning with Pre-training</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08295v1</link><description>In recent years, continual learning with pre-training (CLPT) has receivedwidespread interest, instead of its traditional focus of training from scratch.The use of strong pre-trained models (PTMs) can greatly facilitate knowledgetransfer and alleviate catastrophic forgetting, but also suffers fromprogressive overfitting of pre-trained knowledge into specific downstreamtasks. A majority of current efforts often keep the PTMs frozen and incorporatetask-specific prompts to instruct representation learning, coupled with aprompt selection process for inference. However, due to the limited capacity ofprompt parameters, this strategy demonstrates only sub-optimal performance incontinual learning. In comparison, tuning all parameters of PTMs often providesthe greatest potential for representation learning, making sequentialfine-tuning (Seq FT) a fundamental baseline that has been overlooked in CLPT.To this end, we present an in-depth analysis of the progressive overfittingproblem from the lens of Seq FT. Considering that the overly fastrepresentation learning and the biased classification layer constitute thisparticular problem, we introduce the advanced Slow Learner with ClassifierAlignment (SLCA++) framework to unleash the power of Seq FT, serving as astrong baseline approach for CLPT. Our approach involves a Slow Learner toselectively reduce the learning rate of backbone parameters, and a ClassifierAlignment to align the disjoint classification layers in a post-hoc fashion. Wefurther enhance the efficacy of SL with a symmetric cross-entropy loss, as wellas employ a parameter-efficient strategy to implement Seq FT with SLCA++.Across a variety of continual learning scenarios on image classificationbenchmarks, our approach provides substantial improvements and outperformsstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

In classicalstatistics, the predictive error is understood as a trade-off between the biasand the variance that balances model simplicity with its ability to fit complexfunctions. However, over-parameterized models exhibit counter-intuitivebehaviors, such as "double descent" in which models of increasing complexityexhibit decreasing generalization error. We introduce an alternative paradigmcalled the generalized aliasing decomposition. We explain the asymptoticallysmall error of complex models as a systematic "de-aliasing" that occurs in theover-parameterized regime. In the limit of large models, the contribution dueto aliasing vanishes, leaving an expression for the asymptotic total error wecall the invertibility failure of very large models on few training points.Because the generalized aliasing decomposition can be explicitly calculatedfrom the relationship between model class and samples without seeing any datalabels, it can answer questions related to experimental design and modelselection before collecting data or performing experiments. We demonstrate thisapproach using several examples, including classical regression problems and acluster expansion model used in materials science.</description><author>Mark K. Transtrum, Gus L. W.

While machine learning approaches have shown promisein multi-scene recommendation, existing methodologies often struggle to addresscold-start problems in unprecedented scenes: the increasing diversity ofcommercial choices, along with the short online lifespan of scenes, give riseto the complexity of effective recommendations in online and dynamic scenes. Inthis work, we propose Scene-wise Adaptive Network (SwAN), a novel approach thatemphasizes high-performance cold-start online recommendations for new scenes.Our approach introduces several crucial capabilities, including scenesimilarity learning, user-specific scene transition cognition, scene-specificinformation construction for the new scene, and enhancing the diverged logicalinformation between scenes. We demonstrate SwAN's potential to optimize dynamicmulti-scene recommendation problems by effectively online handling cold-startrecommendations for any newly arrived scenes. More encouragingly, SwAN has beensuccessfully deployed in Meituan's online catering recommendation service,which serves millions of customers per day, and SwAN has achieved a 5.64% CTRindex improvement relative to the baselines and a 5.19% increase in daily ordervolume proportion.</description><author>Wenhao Li, Jie Zhou, Chuan Luo, Chao Tang, Kun Zhang, Shixiong Zhao</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 17:40:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07278v2</guid></item><item><title>Absence of Closed-Form Descriptions for Gradient Flow in Two-Layer Narrow Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08286v1</link><description>In the field of machine learning, comprehending the intricate trainingdynamics of neural networks poses a significant challenge. This paper exploresthe training dynamics of neural networks, particularly whether these dynamicscan be expressed in a general closed-form solution. We demonstrate that thedynamics of the gradient flow in two-layer narrow networks is not an integrablesystem. Integrable systems are characterized by trajectories confined tosubmanifolds defined by level sets of first integrals (invariants),facilitating predictable and reducible dynamics. In contrast, non-integrablesystems exhibit complex behaviors that are difficult to predict. To establishthe non-integrability, we employ differential Galois theory, which focuses onthe solvability of linear differential equations. We demonstrate that undermild conditions, the identity component of the differential Galois group of thevariational equations of the gradient flow is non-solvable. This resultconfirms the system's non-integrability and implies that the training dynamicscannot be represented by Liouvillian functions, precluding a closed-formsolution for describing these dynamics. Our findings highlight the necessity ofemploying numerical methods to tackle optimization problems within neuralnetworks. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of neural networktraining dynamics and their implications for machine learning optimizationstrategies.</description><author>Yeachan Park</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 17:40:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08286v1</guid></item><item><title>Direct Large Language Model Alignment Through Self-Rewarding Contrastive Prompt Distillation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11907v2</link><description>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human expectations withouthuman-annotated preference data is an important problem.

Basedon this, we propose an automatic alignment method, Direct Large Model Alignment(DLMA). First, we use contrastive prompt pairs to automatically generatepreference data. Then, we continue to evaluate the generated preference datausing contrastive prompt pairs and calculate a self-rewarding score. Finally,we use the DPO algorithm to effectively align LLMs by combining thisself-rewarding score.

However, elucidating structure using onlyone-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra, the most readily accessible data, remains anextremely challenging problem because of the combinatorial explosion of thenumber of possible molecules as the number of constituent atoms is increased.Here, we introduce a multitask machine learning framework that predicts themolecular structure (formula and connectivity) of an unknown compound solelybased on its 1D 1H and/or 13C NMR spectra. First, we show how a transformerarchitecture can be constructed to efficiently solve the task, traditionallyperformed by chemists, of assembling large numbers of molecular fragments intomolecular structures. Integrating this capability with a convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN), we build an end-to-end model for predicting structure fromspectra that is fast and accurate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of thisframework on molecules with up to 19 heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms, a size forwhich there are trillions of possible structures. Without relying on any priorchemical knowledge such as the molecular formula, we show that our approachpredicts the exact molecule 69.6% of the time within the first 15 predictions,reducing the search space by up to 11 orders of magnitude.</description><author>Frank Hu, Michael S.

Just Like That: Simple and Efficient Parameter Upcycling for Mixture of Experts</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08274v1</link><description>The Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework has become a popular architecture forlarge language models due to its superior performance over dense models.However, training MoEs from scratch in a large-scale regime is prohibitivelyexpensive. Existing methods mitigate this by pre-training multiple dense expertmodels independently and using them to initialize an MoE. This is done by usingexperts' feed-forward network (FFN) to initialize the MoE's experts whilemerging other parameters. However, this method limits the reuse of dense modelparameters to only the FFN layers, thereby constraining the advantages when"upcycling" these models into MoEs. We propose BAM (Branch-Attend-Mix), asimple yet effective method that addresses this shortcoming. BAM makes full useof specialized dense models by not only using their FFN to initialize the MoElayers but also leveraging experts' attention parameters fully by initializingthem into a soft-variant of Mixture of Attention (MoA) layers. We explore twomethods for upcycling attention parameters: 1) initializing separate attentionexperts from dense models including all attention parameters for the best modelperformance; and 2) sharing key and value parameters across all experts tofacilitate for better inference efficiency. To further improve efficiency, weadopt a parallel attention transformer architecture to MoEs, which allows theattention experts and FFN experts to be computed concurrently. Our experimentson seed models ranging from 590 million to 2 billion parameters demonstratethat BAM surpasses baselines in both perplexity and downstream taskperformance, within the same computational and data constraints.</description><author>Qizhen Zhang, Nikolas Gritsch, Dwaraknath Gnaneshwar, Simon Guo, David Cairuz, Bharat Venkitesh, Jakob Foerster, Phil Blunsom, Sebastian Ruder, Ahmet Ustun, Acyr Locatelli</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 17:19:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08274v1</guid></item><item><title>Is Knowledge Power? On the (Im)possibility of Learning from Strategic Interaction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08272v1</link><description>When learning in strategic environments, a key question is whether agents canovercome uncertainty about their preferences to achieve outcomes they couldhave achieved absent any uncertainty. Can they do this solely throughinteractions with each other? We focus this question on the ability of agentsto attain the value of their Stackelberg optimal strategy and study the impactof information asymmetry. We study repeated interactions in fully strategicenvironments where players' actions are decided based on learning algorithmsthat take into account their observed histories and knowledge of the game. Westudy the pure Nash equilibria (PNE) of a meta-game where players choose thesealgorithms as their actions. We demonstrate that if one player has perfectknowledge about the game, then any initial informational gap persists. That is,while there is always a PNE in which the informed agent achieves herStackelberg value, there is a game where no PNE of the meta-game allows thepartially informed player to achieve her Stackelberg value. On the other hand,if both players start with some uncertainty about the game, the quality ofinformation alone does not determine which agent can achieve her Stackelbergvalue. In this case, the concept of information asymmetry becomes nuanced anddepends on the game's structure. Overall, our findings suggest that repeatedstrategic interactions alone cannot facilitate learning effectively enough toearn an uninformed player her Stackelberg value.</description><author>Nivasini Ananthakrishnan, Nika Haghtalab, Chara Podimata, Kunhe Yang</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 17:17:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08272v1</guid></item><item><title>HeightLane: BEV Heightmap guided 3D Lane Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08270v1</link><description>Accurate 3D lane detection from monocular images presents significantchallenges due to depth ambiguity and imperfect ground modeling. Previousattempts to model the ground have often used a planar ground assumption withlimited degrees of freedom, making them unsuitable for complex roadenvironments with varying slopes. Our study introduces HeightLane, aninnovative method that predicts a height map from monocular images by creatinganchors based on a multi-slope assumption. This approach provides a detailedand accurate representation of the ground. HeightLane employs the predictedheightmap along with a deformable attention-based spatial feature transformframework to efficiently convert 2D image features into 3D bird's eye view(BEV) features, enhancing spatial understanding and lane structure recognition.Additionally, the heightmap is used for the positional encoding of BEVfeatures, further improving their spatial accuracy.

Federated learning models provide such a decentralized machinelearning framework in which multiple investigators in possession of disparatedatasets and working on different devices or servers can train collaborativelya global machine learning models without ever having to exchange local data andthus can meet statutory PHI protections. To this end, a vertical federatelearning model is devised and tested for efficacy in the detection ofAlzheimer's Disease (AD). METHODS: The second version of Open Access Series of Imaging Studies -- withits panoply of demographic, imaging, and clinical assessment datasets -- wasused to test a multimodal vertical federated learning (VFL) model for ADdetection. RESULTS: By training and validating this VFL model on the demographic,clinical, and MRI data in OASIS-2, an 82.9\% accuracy rate is achieved,consistent with previously reported results. CONCLUSIONS: The VFL architecture proposed herein offers a novel distributedarchitecture, enabling collaborative learning across diverse sources of medicaldata while respecting statutory privacy constraints. By leveraging multiplemodalities of data, the robustness and accuracy of AD detection can beenhanced. This model not only contributes to the advancement of federatedlearning techniques but also holds promise for overcoming the hurdles posed bydata segmentation in medical research.</description><author>Paul K.

The main challenge in egocentric poseestimation is overcoming joint invisibility, which is caused by self-occlusionor a limited field of view (FOV) of head-mounted cameras. Our approachovercomes this challenge by incorporating a two-stage pose estimation paradigm:in the first stage, our model leverages the global information to estimate eachjoint's coarse location, then in the second stage, it employs a DETR styletransformer to refine the coarse locations by exploiting fine-grained stereovisual features. In addition, we present a Deformable Stereo Attentionoperation to enable our transformer to effectively process multi-view features,which enables it to accurately localize each joint in the 3D world. We evaluateour method on the stereo UnrealEgo dataset and show it significantlyoutperforms previous approaches while being computationally efficient: itimproves MPJPE by 27.4mm (45% improvement) with only 7.9% model parameters and13.1% FLOPs compared to the state-of-the-art. Surprisingly, with propertraining settings, we find that even our first-stage pose proposal network canachieve superior performance compared to previous arts. We also show that ourmethod can be seamlessly extended to monocular settings, which achievesstate-of-the-art performance on the SceneEgo dataset, improving MPJPE by 25.5mm(21% improvement) compared to the best existing method with only 60.7% modelparameters and 36.4% FLOPs.

However, rather than merelygenerating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream rewardfunctions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existingmethods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models(\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationallyexpensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-freeguidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method toaddress these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method thatintegrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisystates lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inferenceprocedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoidsfine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to constructdifferentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilizenon-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientificdomains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in aprincipled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithmacross several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, andDNA/RNA sequence generation.

The learned KG embeddings are typically used toanswer queries by ranking all potential answers, but rankings often lack ameaningful probabilistic interpretation - lower-ranked answers do notnecessarily have a lower probability of being true. This limitation makes itdifficult to distinguish plausible from implausible answers, posing challengesfor the application of KGE methods in high-stakes domains like medicine. Weaddress this issue by applying the theory of conformal prediction that allowsgenerating answer sets, which contain the correct answer with probabilisticguarantees. We explain how conformal prediction can be used to generate suchanswer sets for link prediction tasks. Our empirical evaluation on fourbenchmark datasets using six representative KGE methods validates that thegenerated answer sets satisfy the probabilistic guarantees given by the theoryof conformal prediction. We also demonstrate that the generated answer setsoften have a sensible size and that the size adapts well with respect to thedifficulty of the query.</description><author>Yuqicheng Zhu, Nico Potyka, Jiarong Pan, Bo Xiong, Yunjie He, Evgeny Kharlamov, Steffen Staab</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 16:36:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08248v1</guid></item><item><title>DiffPMAE: Diffusion Masked Autoencoders for Point Cloud Reconstruction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03298v3</link><description>Point cloud streaming is increasingly getting popular, evolving into the normfor interactive service delivery and the future Metaverse.

Large Language Models(LLMs) deeply explore language instructions, playing a crucial role in devisingplans for complex tasks.

Current generalizableobject pose estimators, i.e., approaches that do not need to be trained perobject, rely on accurate 3D models. Predominantly, CAD models are used, whichcan be hard to obtain in practice. At the same time, it is often possible toacquire images of an object. Naturally, this leads to the question whether 3Dmodels reconstructed from images are sufficient to facilitate accurate objectpose estimation. We aim to answer this question by proposing a novel benchmarkfor measuring the impact of 3D reconstruction quality on pose estimationaccuracy. Our benchmark provides calibrated images for object reconstructionregistered with the test images of the YCB-V dataset for pose evaluation underthe BOP benchmark format. Detailed experiments with multiple state-of-the-art3D reconstruction and object pose estimation approaches show that the geometryproduced by modern reconstruction methods is often sufficient for accurate poseestimation. Our experiments lead to interesting observations: (1) Standardmetrics for measuring 3D reconstruction quality are not necessarily indicativeof pose estimation accuracy, which shows the need for dedicated benchmarks suchas ours. (2) Classical, non-learning-based approaches can perform on par withmodern learning-based reconstruction techniques and can even offer a betterreconstruction time-pose accuracy tradeoff. (3) There is still a sizable gapbetween performance with reconstructed and with CAD models.

Driven by the need to analyze datasets whose objects haveincreasingly complex structure (such as node and edge-attributed graphs),several variants of GW distance have been introduced in the recent literature.With a view toward establishing a general framework for the theory of GW-likedistances, this paper considers a vast generalization of the notion of a metricmeasure space: for an arbitrary metric space $Z$, we define a $Z$-network to bea measure space endowed with a kernel valued in $Z$. We introduce a method forcomparing $Z$-networks by defining a generalization of GW distance, which werefer to as $Z$-Gromov-Wasserstein ($Z$-GW) distance. This constructionsubsumes many previously known metrics and offers a unified approach tounderstanding their shared properties. The paper demonstrates that the $Z$-GWdistance defines a metric on the space of $Z$-networks which retains desirableproperties of $Z$, such as separability, completeness, and geodesicity. Many ofthese properties were unknown for existing variants of GW distance that fallunder our framework. Our focus is on foundational theory, but our results alsoinclude computable lower bounds and approximations of the distance which willbe useful for practical applications.</description><author>Martin Bauer, Facundo M√©moli, Tom Needham, Mao Nishino</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 15:58:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08233v1</guid></item><item><title>Explaining an Agent's Future Beliefs through Temporally Decomposing Future Reward Estimators</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08230v1</link><description>Future reward estimation is a core component of reinforcement learningagents; i.e., Q-value and state-value functions, predicting an agent's sum offuture rewards.

We address this bymodifying an agent's future reward estimator to predict their next N expectedrewards, referred to as Temporal Reward Decomposition (TRD). This unlocks novelexplanations of agent behaviour. Through TRD we can: estimate when an agent mayexpect to receive a reward, the value of the reward and the agent's confidencein receiving it; measure an input feature's temporal importance to the agent'saction decisions; and predict the influence of different actions on futurerewards. Furthermore, we show that DQN agents trained on Atari environments canbe efficiently retrained to incorporate TRD with minimal impact on performance.</description><author>Mark Towers, Yali Du, Christopher Freeman, Timothy J.

They provide highspatial resolution, but struggle to offer fine temporal resolutions. Toovercome this shortcoming, we study the idea of replacing the RGB camera withan event-based camera and introduce a new event-based optical tactile sensorcalled Evetac. Along with hardware design, we develop touch processingalgorithms to process its measurements online at 1000 Hz. We devise anefficient algorithm to track the elastomer's deformation through the imprintedmarkers despite the sensor's sparse output. Benchmarking experimentsdemonstrate Evetac's capabilities of sensing vibrations up to 498 Hz,reconstructing shear forces, and significantly reducing data rates compared toRGB optical tactile sensors. Moreover, Evetac's output and the marker trackingprovide meaningful features for learning data-driven slip detection andprediction models. The learned models form the basis for a robust and adaptiveclosed-loop grasp controller capable of handling a wide range of objects. Webelieve that fast and efficient event-based tactile sensors like Evetac will beessential for bringing human-like manipulation capabilities to robotics.

This paper presents the firstcomprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enablingfrontier large language models to perform research independently andcommunicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generatesnovel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results,describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs asimulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can berepeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like thehuman scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it tothree distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling,transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea isimplemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 perpaper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automatedreviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paperscores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptancethreshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automatedreviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientificdiscovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AIagents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to aworld where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed onthe world's most challenging problems.

The SAM update consists of onestep for computing the perturbation and the other for computing the updategradient. Within the two steps, the choice of the perturbation radius iscrucial to the performance of SAM, but finding an appropriate perturbationradius is challenging. In this paper, we propose a bilevel optimizationframework called LEarning the perTurbation radiuS (LETS) to learn theperturbation radius for sharpness-aware minimization algorithms. Specifically,in the proposed LETS method, the upper-level problem aims at seeking a goodperturbation radius by minimizing the squared generalization gap between thetraining and validation losses, while the lower-level problem is the SAMoptimization problem. Moreover, the LETS method can be combined with anyvariant of SAM. Experimental results on various architectures and benchmarkdatasets in computer vision and natural language processing demonstrate theeffectiveness of the proposed LETS method in improving the performance of SAM.</description><author>Xuehao Wang, Weisen Jiang, Shuai Fu, Yu Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 15:40:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08222v1</guid></item><item><title>GIR: 3D Gaussian Inverse Rendering for Relightable Scene Factorization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05133v2</link><description>This paper presents a 3D Gaussian Inverse Rendering (GIR) method, employing3D Gaussian representations to effectively factorize the scene into materialproperties, light, and geometry.

When dealing with sensitive data, privacy-preserving algorithmsaim to approximate the non-private baseline while minimising the leakage ofsensitive information. State-of-the-art privacy-preserving clusteringalgorithms tend to output clusters that are good in terms of the standardmetrics, inertia, silhouette score, and clustering accuracy, however, theclustering result strongly deviates from the non-private KMeans baseline. Inthis work, we present a privacy-preserving clustering algorithm called \DPMthat recursively separates a data set into clusters based on a geometricalclustering approach. In addition, \DPM estimates most of the data-dependenthyper-parameters in a privacy-preserving way. We prove that \DPM preservesDifferential Privacy and analyse the utility guarantees of \DPM. Finally, weconduct an extensive empirical evaluation for synthetic and real-life datasets.

BEE has traditionally been formulated as a classification problem. Withthe recent technological advancements in large language models (LLMs),generation-based models that cast event extraction as a sequence generationproblem have attracted much attention from the NLP research communities.However, current generative models often overlook the importance ofcross-instance information from complex event structures such as nested eventsand overlapping events, which contribute quite significantly in the benchmarkdatasets. In this paper, we propose an event structure-aware generative modelcalled GenBEE, which can capture complex event structures in biomedical textfor biomedical event extraction. In particular, GenBEE constructs event promptsthat distill knowledge from LLMs for incorporating both label semantics andargument dependency relationships into the proposed model. In addition, GenBEEalso generates prefixes with event structural prompts to incorporate structuralfeatures for improving the model's overall performance. We have evaluated theproposed GenBEE model on three widely used biomedical event extractionbenchmark datasets, namely MLEE, GE11, and PHEE. Experimental results show thatGenBEE has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MLEE and GE11 datasets,and achieved competitive results when compared to the state-of-the-artclassification-based models on the PHEE dataset.</description><author>Haohan Yuan, Siu Cheung Hui, Haopeng Zhang</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 15:24:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06583v3</guid></item><item><title>Moving Healthcare AI-Support Systems for Visually Detectable Diseases onto Constrained Devices</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08215v1</link><description>Image classification usually requires connectivity and access to the cloudwhich is often limited in many parts of the world, including hard to reachrural areas.

However, there is an ongoing debate about the extent to whichLLMs are capable of actual reasoning. Central to this debate are two keyprobabilistic concepts that are essential for connecting causes to theireffects: the probability of necessity (PN) and the probability of sufficiency(PS). This paper introduces a framework that is both theoretical and practical,aimed at assessing how effectively LLMs are able to replicate real-worldreasoning mechanisms using these probabilistic measures. By viewing LLMs asabstract machines that process information through a natural languageinterface, we examine the conditions under which it is possible to computesuitable approximations of PN and PS.

In our study, we investigate paradigms in MTL inthe context of STL: First, the impact of the choice of optimizer has only beenmildly investigated in MTL. We show the pivotal role of common STL tools suchas the Adam optimizer in MTL empirically in various experiments. To furtherinvestigate Adam's effectiveness, we theoretical derive a partial loss-scaleinvariance under mild assumptions. Second, the notion of gradient conflicts hasoften been phrased as a specific problem in MTL. We delve into the role ofgradient conflicts in MTL and compare it to STL. For angular gradient alignmentwe find no evidence that this is a unique problem in MTL. We emphasizedifferences in gradient magnitude as the main distinguishing factor. Overall,we find surprising similarities between STL and MTL suggesting to considermethods from both fields in a broader context.</description><author>Cathrin Elich, Lukas Kirchdorfer, Jan M.

Large Language Models (LLMs), equipped with extensive openknowledge and semantic reasoning abilities, present a promising avenue tobridge this information gap. However, employing LLMs for denoising insequential recommendation introduces notable challenges: 1) Direct applicationof pretrained LLMs may not be competent for the denoising task, frequentlygenerating nonsensical responses; 2) Even after fine-tuning, the reliability ofLLM outputs remains questionable, especially given the complexity of the taskand th inherent hallucinatory issue of LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we propose LLM4DSR, a tailored approach fordenoising sequential recommendation using LLMs. We constructed aself-supervised fine-tuning task to activate LLMs' capabilities to identifynoisy items and suggest replacements. Furthermore, we developed an uncertaintyestimation module that ensures only high-confidence responses are utilized forsequence corrections. Remarkably, LLM4DSR is model-agnostic, allowing thecorrected sequences to be flexibly applied across various recommendationmodels. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of LLM4DSR over existingmethods across three datasets and three recommendation backbones.</description><author>Bohao Wang, Feng Liu, Jiawei Chen, Yudi Wu, Xingyu Lou, Jun Wang, Yan Feng, Chun Chen, Can Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 15:18:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08208v1</guid></item><item><title>WaterSplatting: Fast Underwater 3D Scene Reconstruction Using Gaussian Splatting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08206v1</link><description>The underwater 3D scene reconstruction is a challenging, yet interestingproblem with applications ranging from naval robots to VR experiences. Theproblem was successfully tackled by fully volumetric NeRF-based methods whichcan model both the geometry and the medium (water). Unfortunately, thesemethods are slow to train and do not offer real-time rendering. More recently,3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method offered a fast alternative to NeRFs.However, because it is an explicit method that renders only the geometry, itcannot render the medium and is therefore unsuited for underwaterreconstruction. Therefore, we propose a novel approach that fuses volumetricrendering with 3DGS to handle underwater data effectively. Our method employs3DGS for explicit geometry representation and a separate volumetric field(queried once per pixel) for capturing the scattering medium. This dualrepresentation further allows the restoration of the scenes by removing thescattering medium. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based methodsin rendering quality on the underwater SeaThru-NeRF dataset. Furthermore, itdoes so while offering real-time rendering performance, addressing theefficiency limitations of existing methods.

However, existing attacks aretypically designed for single-task purposes, which means they are tailored toexploit vulnerabilities unique to the individual target rather than beingadaptable for multiple users or systems. This limitation makes them unsuitablefor certain attack scenarios, such as morphing, universal, transferable, andcounter attacks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task adversarial attackalgorithm called MTADV that are adaptable for multiple users or systems. Byinterpreting these scenarios as multi-task attacks, MTADV is applicable to bothsingle- and multi-task attacks, and feasible in the white- and gray-boxsettings. Furthermore, MTADV is effective against various face datasets,including LFW, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ, and can work with different deep learningmodels, such as FaceNet, InsightFace, and CurricularFace. Importantly, MTADVretains its feasibility as a single-task attack targeting a single user/system.To the best of our knowledge, MTADV is the first adversarial attack method thatcan target all of the aforementioned scenarios in one algorithm.</description><author>Hanrui Wang, Shuo Wang, Cunjian Chen, Massimo Tistarelli, Zhe Jin</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 15:13:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08205v1</guid></item><item><title>Towards Practical Human Motion Prediction with LiDAR Point Clouds</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08202v1</link><description>Human motion prediction is crucial for human-centric multimedia understandingand interacting.

Although the numberof training samples can be reduced substantially, current state-of-the-artmethods heavily rely on enormous soft labels to achieve satisfactoryperformance. As a result, the required storage can be comparable even tooriginal datasets, especially for large-scale ones. To solve this problem,instead of storing these heavy labels, we propose a novel label-lighteningframework termed HeLlO aiming at effective image-to-label projectors, withwhich synthetic labels can be directly generated online from synthetic images.Specifically, to construct such projectors, we leverage prior knowledge inopen-source foundation models, e.g., CLIP, and introduce a LoRA-likefine-tuning strategy to mitigate the gap between pre-trained and targetdistributions, so that original models for soft-label generation can bedistilled into a group of low-rank matrices. Moreover, an effective imageoptimization method is proposed to further mitigate the potential error betweenthe original and distilled label generators. Extensive experiments demonstratethat with only about 0.003% of the original storage required for a complete setof soft labels, we achieve comparable performance to current state-of-the-artdataset distillation methods on large-scale datasets.

In such cases, these methods are prone to overfitting and encounterdifficulties when personalizing individuals of diverse styles. Moreover, thesetraining-based approaches also struggle with multi-concept human imagecustomizing. To this end, we propose MagicFace, the first method foruniversal-style human image personalized synthesis that enablessingle/multi-concept customization for humans of any style in a training-freemanner. MagicFace introduces a coarse-to-fine generation pipeline, involvingtwo sequential stages: semantic scene construction and concept featureinjection. This is achieved by our Reference-aware Self-Attention (RSA) andRegion-grouped Blend Attention (RBA) mechanisms. Specifically, in the firststage, RSA enables the latent image to query features from reference conceptssimultaneously, extracting the coarse-grained overall semantic understanding tofacilitate the initial semantic layout establishment. In the second stage, weemploy an attention-based semantic segmentation method to pinpoint thegenerated regions of all concepts in the latent image at each step. Followingthis, RBA divides the pixels of the latent image into semantic groups, witheach group querying fine-grained features from its reference concept, whichensures precise attribute alignment and feature injection. Throughout thetwo-stage process, a weight mask strategy is employed to ensure the modelfocuses more on the reference concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate oursuperiority in both human-centric subject-to-image synthesis and multi-concepthuman image customization. Our approach also can be applied to texturetransformation, further enhancing its versatility and applicability.</description><author>Yibin Wang, Weizhong Zhang, Cheng Jin</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 15:00:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07433v2</guid></item><item><title>Large Language Models are Few-Shot Training Example Generators: A Case Study in Fallacy Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09552v2</link><description>Recognizing fallacies is crucial for ensuring the quality and validity ofarguments across various domains. However, computational fallacy recognitionfaces challenges due to the diverse genres, domains, and types of fallaciesfound in datasets. This leads to a highly multi-class, and even multi-label,setup with substantial class imbalance. In this study, we aim to enhanceexisting models for fallacy recognition by incorporating additional context andby leveraging large language models to generate synthetic data, thus increasingthe representation of the infrequent classes. We experiment with GPT3.5 togenerate synthetic examples and we examine the impact of prompt settings forthis. Moreover, we explore zero-shot and few-shot scenarios to evaluate theeffectiveness of using the generated examples for training smaller modelswithin a unified fallacy recognition framework. Furthermore, we analyze theoverlap between the synthetic data and existing fallacy datasets. Finally, weinvestigate the usefulness of providing supplementary context for detectingfallacy types that need such context, e.g., diversion fallacies. Our evaluationresults demonstrate consistent improvements across fallacy types, datasets, andgenerators.

In practical use cases, new generation algorithms arecontinually emerging, and these algorithms are not encountered during thedevelopment of detection methods. This calls for the generalization ability ofthe method. Additionally, to ensure the credibility of detection methods, it isbeneficial for the model to interpret which cues from the video indicate it isfake. Motivated by these considerations, we then propose a multi-stream fusionapproach with one-class learning as a representation-level regularizationtechnique. We study the generalization problem of audio-visual deepfakedetection by creating a new benchmark by extending and re-splitting theexisting FakeAVCeleb dataset. The benchmark contains four categories of fakevideos (Real Audio-Fake Visual, Fake Audio-Fake Visual, Fake Audio-Real Visual,and Unsynchronized videos). The experimental results demonstrate that ourapproach surpasses the previous models by a large margin.

Existing methods,mostly supervised, face challenges in obtaining labeled entity pairs. Toaddress this, recent studies have shifted towards self-supervised andunsupervised frameworks. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches havelimitations: (1) Relation passing: mainly focusing on the entity whileneglecting the semantic information of relations, (2) Isomorphic assumption:assuming isomorphism between source and target graphs, which leads to noise andreduced alignment accuracy, and (3) Noise vulnerability: susceptible to noisein the textual features, especially when encountering inconsistent translationsor Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) problems. In this paper, we propose ERAlign, anunsupervised and robust cross-lingual EA pipeline that jointly performsEntity-level and Relation-level Alignment by neighbor triple matching strategyusing semantic textual features of relations and entities. Its refinement stepiteratively enhances results by fusing entity-level and relation-levelalignments based on neighbor triple matching. The additional verification stepexamines the entities' neighbor triples as the linearized text. ThisAlign-then-Verify pipeline rigorously assesses alignment results, achievingnear-perfect alignment even in the presence of noisy textual features ofentities. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the robustness and generalapplicability of ERAlign improved the accuracy and effectiveness of EA tasks,contributing significantly to knowledge-oriented applications.</description><author>Soojin Yoon, Sungho Ko, Tongyoung Kim, SeongKu Kang, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 14:52:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15588v2</guid></item><item><title>Stochastic Semi-Gradient Descent for Learning Mean Field Games with Population-Aware Function Approximation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08192v1</link><description>Mean field games (MFGs) model the interactions within a large-populationmulti-agent system using the population distribution. Traditional learningmethods for MFGs are based on fixed-point iteration (FPI), which calculatesbest responses and induced population distribution separately and sequentially.However, FPI-type methods suffer from inefficiency and instability, due tooscillations caused by the forward-backward procedure. This paper considers anonline learning method for MFGs, where an agent updates its policy andpopulation estimates simultaneously and fully asynchronously, resulting in asimple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) type method called SemiSGD. Not onlydoes SemiSGD exhibit numerical stability and efficiency, but it also provides anovel perspective by treating the value function and population distribution asa unified parameter. We theoretically show that SemiSGD directs this unifiedparameter along a descent direction to the mean field equilibrium. Motivated bythis perspective, we develop a linear function approximation (LFA) for both thevalue function and the population distribution, resulting in the firstpopulation-aware LFA for MFGs on continuous state-action space. Finite-timeconvergence and approximation error analysis are provided for SemiSGD equippedwith population-aware LFA.</description><author>Chenyu Zhang, Xu Chen, Xuan Di</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 14:51:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08192v1</guid></item><item><title>Beyond Full Label: Single-Point Prompt for Infrared Small Target Label Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08191v1</link><description>In this work, we make the first attempt to construct a learning-basedsingle-point annotation paradigm for infrared small target label generation(IRSTLG). Our intuition is that label generation requires just one more pointprompt than target detection: IRSTLG can be regarded as an infrared smalltarget detection (IRSTD) task with the target location hint. Based on thisinsight, we introduce an energy double guided single-point prompt (EDGSP)framework, which adeptly transforms the target detection network into a refinedlabel generation method. Specifically, the proposed EDGSP includes: 1) targetenergy initialization (TEI) to create a foundational outline for sufficientshape evolution of pseudo label, 2) double prompt embedding (DPE) for rapidlocalization of interested regions and reinforcement of individual differencesto avoid label adhesion, and 3) bounding box-based matching (BBM) to eliminatefalse alarms. Experimental results show that pseudo labels generated by threebaselines equipped with EDGSP achieve 100% object-level probability ofdetection (Pd) and 0% false-alarm rate (Fa) on SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1kdatasets, with a pixel-level intersection over union (IoU) improvement of13.28% over state-of-the-art label generation methods.

Thus, the model's capacity to comprehend thetemporal logic conveyed in prompts and generate videos with coherent motion isrestricted. To tackle this limitation, we introduce FancyVideo, an innovativevideo generator that improves the existing text-control mechanism with thewell-designed Cross-frame Textual Guidance Module (CTGM). Specifically, CTGMincorporates the Temporal Information Injector (TII), Temporal Affinity Refiner(TAR), and Temporal Feature Booster (TFB) at the beginning, middle, and end ofcross-attention, respectively, to achieve frame-specific textual guidance.Firstly, TII injects frame-specific information from latent features into textconditions, thereby obtaining cross-frame textual conditions. Then, TAR refinesthe correlation matrix between cross-frame textual conditions and latentfeatures along the time dimension. Lastly, TFB boosts the temporal consistencyof latent features. Extensive experiments comprising both quantitative andqualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FancyVideo. Ourapproach achieves state-of-the-art T2V generation results on the EvalCrafterbenchmark and facilitates the synthesis of dynamic and consistent videos.

This work proposes an approach to exploit the task hierarchy fromhuman instructions to facilitate multi-robot planning. Using Large LanguageModels (LLMs), we propose a two-step approach to translate multi-sentenceinstructions into a structured language, Hierarchical Linear Temporal Logic(LTL), which serves as a formal representation for planning. Initially, LLMstransform the instructions into a hierarchical representation defined asHierarchical Task Tree, capturing the logical and temporal relations amongtasks. Following this, a domain-specific fine-tuning of LLM translatessub-tasks of each task into flat LTL formulas, aggregating them to formhierarchical LTL specifications. These specifications are then leveraged forplanning using off-the-shelf planners. Our framework not only bridges the gapbetween instructions and algorithmic planning but also showcases the potentialof LLMs in harnessing hierarchical reasoning to automate multi-robot taskplanning. Through evaluations in both simulation and real-world experimentsinvolving human participants, we demonstrate that our method can handle morecomplex instructions compared to existing methods. The results indicate thatour approach achieves higher success rates and lower costs in multi-robot taskallocation and plan generation.

To mitigate this, wepresent a data-driven system identification framework that derives models inthe port-Hamiltonian (pH) formulation. This formulation is suitable formulti-physical systems while guaranteeing the useful system theoreticalproperties of passivity and stability. Our framework combines linear andnonlinear reduction with structured, physics-motivated system identification.In this process, high-dimensional state data obtained from possibly nonlinearsystems serves as input for an autoencoder, which then performs two tasks: (i)nonlinearly transforming and (ii) reducing this data onto a low-dimensionallatent space. In this space, a linear pH system, that satisfies the pHproperties per construction, is parameterized by the weights of a neuralnetwork. The mathematical requirements are met by defining the pH matricesthrough Cholesky factorizations. The neural networks that define the coordinatetransformation and the pH system are identified in a joint optimization processto match the dynamics observed in the data while defining a linear pH system inthe latent space. The learned, low-dimensional pH system can describe evennonlinear systems and is rapidly computable due to its small size.

Webegin by evaluating T2I models' ability to innovate and generalize throughcontrolled experiments, revealing that stable diffusion models can effectivelyrecreate unseen elements with sufficiently diverse training data. Then, our keyinsight is that concepts and combinations of image elements the model isfamiliar with, and saw more during training, are more concisly represented inthe model's latent space. We hence propose a method that leverages textualinversion to measure the originality of an image based on the number of tokensrequired for its reconstruction by the model. Our approach is inspired by legaldefinitions of originality and aims to assess whether a model can produceoriginal content without relying on specific prompts or having the trainingdata of the model. We demonstrate our method using both a pre-trained stablediffusion model and a synthetic dataset, showing a correlation between thenumber of tokens and image originality.

Measuring real-world gait turning angles continuously andpassively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitiveindicators of disease progression in PD. This paper presents a deeplearning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints.We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and StridedTransformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 peoplewith PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset ofunscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We alsocurate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M humanpose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previousgait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluatingscripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on real-world settings wherecomplexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due todifficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting,we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manuallabelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculationaccuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weightedprecision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP.

A challenging task concerning grid search is the time management.Without a good time management scheme, a grid search can easily be set off as amission that will not finish in our lifetime. In this study, we introduce aheuristic three-stage mechanism for managing the running time of low-budgetgrid searches, and the sweet-spot grid search (SSGS) and randomized grid search(RGS) strategies for improving model prediction performance, in predicting the5-year, 10-year, and 15-year risk of breast cancer metastasis. We develop deepfeedforward neural network (DFNN) models and optimize them through gridsearches. We conduct eight cycles of grid searches by applying our three-stagemechanism and SSGS and RGS strategies. We conduct various SHAP analysesincluding unique ones that interpret the importance of the DFNN-modelhyperparameters. Our results show that grid search can greatly improve modelprediction. The grid searches we conducted improved the risk prediction of5-year, 10-year, and 15-year breast cancer metastasis by 18.6%, 16.3%, and17.3% respectively, over the average performance of all corresponding models wetrained using the RGS strategy. We not only demonstrate best model performancebut also characterize grid searches from various aspects such as theircapabilities of discovering decent models and the unit grid search time. Thethree-stage mechanism worked effectively. It made our low-budget grid searchesfeasible and manageable, and in the meantime helped improve model predictionperformance. Our SHAP analyses identified both clinical risk factors importantfor the prediction of future risk of breast cancer metastasis, and DFNN-modelhyperparameters important to the prediction of performance scores.</description><author>Xia Jiang, Yijun Zhou, Chuhan Xu, Adam Brufsky, Alan Wells</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 14:35:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07673v2</guid></item><item><title>Machine learning empowered Modulation detection for OFDM-based signals</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08179v1</link><description>We propose a blind ML-based modulation detection for OFDM-based technologies.Unlike previous works that assume an ideal environment with precise knowledgeof subcarrier count and cyclic prefix location, we consider blind modulationdetection while accounting for realistic environmental parameters andimperfections.

However, in rPPG estimation problems, the adapted model usuallyencounters challenges in estimating target data with significant domainvariation. In contrast, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enables the model toadaptively estimate rPPG signals in various unseen domains by online adaptingto unlabeled target data without referring to any source data. In this paper,we first establish a new TTA-rPPG benchmark that encompasses various domaininformation and HR distributions to simulate the challenges encountered inreal-world rPPG estimation. Next, we propose a novel synthetic signal-guidedrPPG estimation framework to address the forgetting issue during the TTA stageand to enhance the adaptation capability of the pre-trained rPPG model. To thisend, we develop a synthetic signal-guided feature learning method bysynthesizing pseudo rPPG signals as pseudo ground truths to guide a conditionalgenerator in generating latent rPPG features. In addition, we design aneffective spectral-based entropy minimization technique to encourage the rPPGmodel to learn new target domain information. Both the generated rPPG featuresand synthesized rPPG signals prevent the rPPG model from overfitting to targetdata and forgetting previously acquired knowledge, while also broadly coveringvarious heart rate (HR) distributions.

We here explore a simple, compelling alternative by marrying therepresentational power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of adatabase. Decomposing the task of image classification into image similarity(from a pre-trained embedding) and search (via fast nearest neighbor retrievalfrom a knowledge database), we build a simple and flexible visual memory thathas the following key capabilities: (1.) The ability to flexibly add dataacross scales: from individual samples all the way to entire classes andbillion-scale data; (2.) The ability to remove data through unlearning andmemory pruning; (3.) An interpretable decision-mechanism on which we canintervene to control its behavior. Taken together, these capabilitiescomprehensively demonstrate the benefits of an explicit visual memory. We hopethat it might contribute to a conversation on how knowledge should berepresented in deep vision models -- beyond carving it in ``stone'' weights.</description><author>Robert Geirhos, Priyank Jaini, Austin Stone, Sourabh Medapati, Xi Yi, George Toderici, Abhijit Ogale, Jonathon Shlens</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 14:19:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08172v1</guid></item><item><title>Robustness-Aware 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving: A Review and Outlook</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06542v3</link><description>In the realm of modern autonomous driving, the perception system isindispensable for accurately assessing the state of the surroundingenvironment, thereby enabling informed prediction and planning. The key step tothis system is related to 3D object detection that utilizes vehicle-mountedsensors such as LiDAR and cameras to identify the size, the category, and thelocation of nearby objects. Despite the surge in 3D object detection methodsaimed at enhancing detection precision and efficiency, there is a gap in theliterature that systematically examines their resilience against environmentalvariations, noise, and weather changes. This study emphasizes the importance ofrobustness, alongside accuracy and latency, in evaluating perception systemsunder practical scenarios. Our work presents an extensive survey ofcamera-only, LiDAR-only, and multi-modal 3D object detection algorithms,thoroughly evaluating their trade-off between accuracy, latency, androbustness, particularly on datasets like KITTI-C and nuScenes-C to ensure faircomparisons. Among these, multi-modal 3D detection approaches exhibit superiorrobustness, and a novel taxonomy is introduced to reorganize the literature forenhanced clarity.

However, many existing algorithms require prior knowledge of theproblem parameters in order to achieve optimal iteration complexity. In thispaper, we propose two completely parameter-free alternating gradient projectionalgorithms, i.e., the PF-AGP-NSC algorithm and the PF-AGP-NC algorithm, tosolve the smooth nonconvex-strongly concave and nonconvex-concave minimaxproblems respectively using a backtracking strategy, which does not requireprior knowledge of parameters such as the Lipschtiz constant $L$ or thestrongly concave constant $\mu$. Moreover, we show that the total number ofgradient calls of the PF-AGP-NSC algorithm and the PF-AGP-NC algorithm toobtain an $\varepsilon$-stationary point is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}\left(L\kappa^3\varepsilon^{-2} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( L^4\varepsilon^{-4}\right)$ respectively, where $\kappa$ is the condition number. As far as weknow, the PF-AGP-NSC algorithm and the PF-AGP-NC algorithm are the firstcompletely parameter-free algorithms for solving nonconvex-strongly concaveminimax problems and nonconvex-concave minimax problems respectively. Numericalresults validate the efficiency of the proposed PF-AGP algorithm.</description><author>Junnan Yang, Huiling Zhang, Zi Xu</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 14:01:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21372v2</guid></item><item><title>Characterizing Multimodal Long-form Summarization: A Case Study on Financial Reports</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06162v3</link><description>As large language models (LLMs) expand the power of natural languageprocessing to handle long inputs, rigorous and systematic analyses arenecessary to understand their abilities and behavior. A salient application issummarization, due to its ubiquity and controversy (e.g., researchers havedeclared the death of summarization). In this paper, we use financial reportsummarization as a case study because financial reports are not only long butalso use numbers and tables extensively. We propose a computational frameworkfor characterizing multimodal long-form summarization and investigate thebehavior of Claude 2.0/2.1, GPT-4/3.5, and Cohere. We find that GPT-3.5 andCohere fail to perform this summarization task meaningfully. For Claude 2 andGPT-4, we analyze the extractiveness of the summary and identify a positionbias in LLMs. This position bias disappears after shuffling the input forClaude, which suggests that Claude seems to recognize important information. Wealso conduct a comprehensive investigation on the use of numeric data inLLM-generated summaries and offer a taxonomy of numeric hallucination. Weemploy prompt engineering to improve GPT-4's use of numbers with limitedsuccess. Overall, our analyses highlight the strong capability of Claude 2 inhandling long multimodal inputs compared to GPT-4.

Our paper addresses the critical question of when and how thesepredictive models can be interpreted causally, specifically focusing on usingthe models for inferring effect ordering rather than precise effect sizes. Weformalize two assumptions, full latent mediation and latent monotonicity, thatare jointly sufficient for inferring effect ordering without direct causaleffect estimation. We explore the utility of these assumptions in assessing thefeasibility of proxies for inferring effect ordering in scenarios where thereis no data on how individuals behave when intervened or no data on the primaryoutcome of interest. Additionally, we provide practical guidelines forpractitioners to make their own assessments about proxies. Our findings revealnot only when it is possible to reasonably infer effect ordering from proxies,but also conditions under which modeling these proxies can outperform directeffect estimation. This study underscores the importance of broadening causalinference to encompass alternative causal interpretations beyond effectestimation, offering a foundation for future research to enhancedecision-making processes when direct effect estimation is not feasible.</description><author>Carlos Fern√°ndez-Lor√≠a, Jorge Lor√≠a</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 13:38:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12532v5</guid></item><item><title>Long-Tailed Classification Based on Coarse-Grained Leading Forest and Multi-Center Loss</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08206v3</link><description>Long-tailed (LT) classification is an unavoidable and challenging problem inthe real world. Most existing long-tailed classification methods focus only onsolving the class-wise imbalance while ignoring the attribute-wise imbalance.The deviation of a classification model is caused by both class-wise andattribute-wise imbalance. Due to the fact that attributes are implicit in mostdatasets and the combination of attributes is complex, attribute-wise imbalanceis more difficult to handle. For this purpose, we proposed a novel long-tailedclassification framework, aiming to build a multi-granularity classificationmodel by means of invariant feature learning. This method first unsupervisedlyconstructs Coarse-Grained forest (CLF) to better characterize the distributionof attributes within a class. Depending on the distribution of attributes, onecan customize suitable sampling strategies to construct different imbalanceddatasets. We then introduce multi-center loss (MCL) that aims to graduallyeliminate confusing attributes during feature learning process. The proposedframework does not necessarily couple to a specific LT classification modelstructure and can be integrated with any existing LT method as an independentcomponent. Extensive experiments show that our approach achievesstate-of-the-art performance on both existing benchmarks ImageNet-GLT andMSCOCO-GLT and can improve the performance of existing LT methods.

However, the prevalent assumption of having an extensive pool oftraining data encompassing all classes prior to model training often divergesfrom real-world scenarios, where limited data availability for novel classes isthe norm. The challenge emerges in seamlessly integrating new classes with fewsamples into the training data, demanding the model to adeptly accommodatethese additions without compromising its performance on base classes. Toaddress this exigency, the research community has introduced several solutionsunder the realm of few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL). In this study, we introduce an innovative FSCIL framework that utilizeslanguage regularizer and subspace regularizer. During base training, thelanguage regularizer helps incorporate semantic information extracted from aVision-Language model. The subspace regularizer helps in facilitating themodel's acquisition of nuanced connections between image and text semanticsinherent to base classes during incremental training. Our proposed frameworknot only empowers the model to embrace novel classes with limited data, butalso ensures the preservation of performance on base classes.

These methods, primarilybased on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restorationnetworks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data inreal-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To thisend, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational\textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existingrestoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes alightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. Byvariational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restorationoutput and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective intopreserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated withhigh-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaTachieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As aresult, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their originalcontent while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level visiontasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement fordetection and classification show the superiority of our method over otherstate-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassingsupervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.</description><author>Jiawei Wu, Zhi Jin</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 13:35:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08149v1</guid></item><item><title>P/D-Serve: Serving Disaggregated Large Language Model at Scale</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08147v1</link><description>Serving disaggregated large language models (LLMs) over tens of thousands ofxPU devices (GPUs or NPUs) with reliable performance faces multiple challenges.1) Ignoring the diversity (various prefixes and tidal requests), treating allthe prompts in a mixed pool is inadequate.

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models, however, interpretthe purpose and key information of user's input to enable responsiveinteractions. Existing NLU models generally map individual utterances to adual-level semantic frame, involving sentence-level intent and word-level slotlabels. However, real-life conversations primarily consist of multi-turnconversations, involving the interpretation of complex and extended dialogues.Researchers encounter challenges addressing all facets of multi-turn dialogueconversations using a unified single NLU model. This paper introduces a novelapproach, MIDAS, leveraging a multi-level intent, domain, and slot knowledgedistillation for multi-turn NLU. To achieve this, we construct distinctteachers for varying levels of conversation knowledge, namely, sentence-levelintent detection, word-level slot filling, and conversation-level domainclassification. These teachers are then fine-tuned to acquire specificknowledge of their designated levels. A multi-teacher loss is proposed tofacilitate the combination of these multi-level teachers, guiding a studentmodel in multi-turn dialogue tasks. The experimental results demonstrate theefficacy of our model in improving the overall multi-turn conversationunderstanding, showcasing the potential for advancements in NLU models throughthe incorporation of multi-level dialogue knowledge distillation techniques.</description><author>Yan Li, So-Eon Kim, Seong-Bae Park, Soyeon Caren Han</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 13:28:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08144v1</guid></item></channel></rss>

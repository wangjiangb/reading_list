Building on disentangled NeuralRadiance Field (NeRF) representations, our approach learns to map BidirectionalReflectance Distribution Functions (BRDF) from pairs of scenes observed invarying conditions, such as dry and wet. The learned transformations can thenbe applied to unseen scenes with similar materials, therefore effectivelyrendering the transformation learned with an arbitrary level of intensity.Extensive experiments on synthetic scenes and real-world objects validate theeffectiveness of our approach, showing that it can learn varioustransformations such as wetness, painting, coating, etc. Our results highlightnot only the versatility of our method but also its potential for practicalapplications in computer graphics.

This paper introduces a novel 3D generation framework thataddresses these challenges, offering scalable, high-quality 3D generation withan interactive Point Cloud-structured Latent space. Our framework employs aVariational Autoencoder (VAE) with multi-view posed RGB-D(epth)-N(ormal)renderings as input, using a unique latent space design that preserves 3D shapeinformation, and incorporates a cascaded latent diffusion model for improvedshape-texture disentanglement. The proposed method, GaussianAnything, supportsmulti-modal conditional 3D generation, allowing for point cloud, caption, andsingle/multi-view image inputs. Notably, the newly proposed latent spacenaturally enables geometry-texture disentanglement, thus allowing 3D-awareediting. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach onmultiple datasets, outperforming existing methods in both text- andimage-conditioned 3D generation.</description><author>Yushi Lan, Shangchen Zhou, Zhaoyang Lyu, Fangzhou Hong, Shuai Yang, Bo Dai, Xingang Pan, Chen Change Loy</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:59:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08033v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning with Less: Knowledge Distillation from Large Language Models via Unlabeled Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08028v1</link><description>In real-world NLP applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promisingsolutions due to their extensive training on vast datasets. However, the largesize and high computation demands of LLMs limit their practicality in manyapplications, especially when further fine-tuning is required. To address theselimitations, smaller models are typically preferred for deployment. However,their training is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data. In contrast,unlabeled data is often readily which can be leveraged by using LLMs togenerate pseudo-labels for training smaller models. This enables the smallermodels (student) to acquire knowledge from LLMs(teacher) while reducingcomputational costs. This process introduces challenges, such as potentialnoisy pseudo-labels. Selecting high-quality and informative data is thereforecritical to enhance model performance while improving the efficiency of datautilization. To address this, we propose LLKD that enables Learning with Lesscomputational resources and less data for Knowledge Distillation from LLMs.LLKD is an adaptive sample selection method that incorporates signals from boththe teacher and student. Specifically, it prioritizes samples where the teacherdemonstrates high confidence in its labeling, indicating reliable labels, andwhere the student exhibits a high information need, identifying challengingsamples that require further learning. Our comprehensive experiments show thatLLKD achieves superior performance across various datasets with higher dataefficiency.</description><author>Juanhui Li, Sreyashi Nag, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Sheikh Sarwar, Limeng Cui, Hansu Gu, Suhang Wang, Qi He, Jiliang Tang</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:57:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08028v1</guid></item><item><title>LLMPhy: Complex Physical Reasoning Using Large Language Models and World Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08027v1</link><description>Physical reasoning is an important skill needed for robotic agents whenoperating in the real world. However, solving such reasoning problems ofteninvolves hypothesizing and reflecting over complex multi-body interactionsunder the effect of a multitude of physical forces and thus learning all suchinteractions poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art machine learningframeworks, including large language models (LLMs). To study this problem, wepropose a new physical reasoning task and a dataset, dubbed TraySim. Our taskinvolves predicting the dynamics of several objects on a tray that is given anexternal impact -- the domino effect of the ensued object interactions andtheir dynamics thus offering a challenging yet controlled setup, with the goalof reasoning being to infer the stability of the objects after the impact. Tosolve this complex physical reasoning task, we present LLMPhy, a zero-shotblack-box optimization framework that leverages the physics knowledge andprogram synthesis abilities of LLMs, and synergizes these abilities with theworld models built into modern physics engines. Specifically, LLMPhy uses anLLM to generate code to iteratively estimate the physical hyperparameters ofthe system (friction, damping, layout, etc.) via an implicitanalysis-by-synthesis approach using a (non-differentiable) simulator in theloop and uses the inferred parameters to imagine the dynamics of the scenetowards solving the reasoning task. To show the effectiveness of LLMPhy, wepresent experiments on our TraySim dataset to predict the steady-state poses ofthe objects. Our results show that the combination of the LLM and the physicsengine leads to state-of-the-art zero-shot physical reasoning performance,while demonstrating superior convergence against standard black-boxoptimization methods and better estimation of the physical parameters.</description><author>Anoop Cherian, Radu Corcodel, Siddarth Jain, Diego Romeres</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:56:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08027v1</guid></item><item><title>Leonardo vindicated: Pythagorean trees for minimal reconstruction of the natural branching structures</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08024v1</link><description>Trees continue to fascinate with their natural beauty and as engineeringmasterpieces optimal with respect to several independent criteria. Pythagoreantree is a well-known fractal design that realistically mimics the natural treebranching structures. We study various types of Pythagorean-like fractal treeswith different shapes of the base, branching angles and relaxed scales in anattempt to identify and explain which variants are the closest match to thebranching structures commonly observed in the natural world. Pursuingsimultaneously the realism and minimalism of the fractal tree model, we havedeveloped a flexibly parameterised and fast algorithm to grow and visuallyexamine deep Pythagorean-inspired fractal trees with the capability to orderlyover- or underestimate the Leonardo da Vinci's tree branching rule as well ascontrol various imbalances and branching angles. We tested the realism of thegenerated fractal tree images by means of the classification accuracy ofdetecting natural tree with the transfer-trained deep Convolutional NeuralNetworks (CNNs). Having empirically established the parameters of the fractaltrees that maximize the CNN's natural tree class classification accuracy wehave translated them back to the scales and angles of branches and came to theinteresting conclusions that support the da Vinci branching rule and goldenratio based scaling for both the shape of the branch and imbalance between thechild branches, and claim the flexibly parameterized fractal trees can be usedto generate artificial examples to train robust detectors of different speciesof trees.</description><author>Dymitr Ruta, Corrado Mio, Ernesto Damiani</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:54:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08024v1</guid></item><item><title>Language Models as Causal Effect Generators</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08019v1</link><description>We present a framework for large language model (LLM) based data generationwith controllable causal structure. In particular, we define a procedure forturning any language model and any directed acyclic graph (DAG) into asequence-driven structural causal model (SD-SCM). Broadly speaking, an SD-SCMis a causal model with user-defined structure and LLM-defined structuralequations. We characterize how an SD-SCM allows sampling from observational,interventional, and counterfactual distributions according to the desiredcausal structure. We then leverage this procedure to propose a new type ofbenchmark for causal inference methods, generating individual-levelcounterfactual data without needing to manually specify functionalrelationships between variables. We create an example benchmark consisting ofthousands of datasets, and test a suite of popular estimation methods on thesedatasets for average, conditional average, and individual treatment effectestimation, both with and without hidden confounding. Apart from generatingdata, the same procedure also allows us to test for the presence of a causaleffect that might be encoded in an LLM. This procedure can underpin auditingLLMs for misinformation, discrimination, or otherwise undesirable behavior. Webelieve SD-SCMs can serve as a useful tool in any application that wouldbenefit from sequential data with controllable causal structure.</description><author>Lucius E. J.

However, foundationalapproaches like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose substantial storage overhead, asStructure-from-Motion (SfM) points can grow to millions, often requiringgigabyte-level disk space for a single unbounded scene. This growth presentsscalability challenges and hinders splatting efficiency. To address this, weintroduce LightGaussian, a method for transforming 3D Gaussians into a morecompact format. Inspired by Network Pruning, LightGaussian identifies Gaussianswith minimal global significance on scene reconstruction, and applies a pruningand recovery process to reduce redundancy while preserving visual quality.Knowledge distillation and pseudo-view augmentation then transfer sphericalharmonic coefficients to a lower degree, yielding compact representations.Gaussian Vector Quantization, based on each Gaussian's global significance,further lowers bitwidth with minimal accuracy loss. LightGaussian achieves anaverage 15x compression rate while boosting FPS from 144 to 237 within the3D-GS framework, enabling efficient complex scene representation on theMip-NeRF 360 and Tank &amp; Temple datasets. The proposed Gaussian pruning approachis also adaptable to other 3D representations (e.g., Scaffold-GS),demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.</description><author>Zhiwen Fan, Kevin Wang, Kairun Wen, Zehao Zhu, Dejia Xu, Zhangyang Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:50:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17245v6</guid></item><item><title>Wavelet Latent Diffusion (Wala): Billion-Parameter 3D Generative Model with Compact Wavelet Encodings</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08017v1</link><description>Large-scale 3D generative models require substantial computational resourcesyet often fall short in capturing fine details and complex geometries at highresolutions. We attribute this limitation to the inefficiency of currentrepresentations, which lack the compactness required to model the generativemodels effectively. To address this, we introduce a novel approach calledWavelet Latent Diffusion, or WaLa, that encodes 3D shapes into wavelet-based,compact latent encodings. Specifically, we compress a $256^3$ signed distancefield into a $12^3 \times 4$ latent grid, achieving an impressive 2427xcompression ratio with minimal loss of detail. This high level of compressionallows our method to efficiently train large-scale generative networks withoutincreasing the inference time. Our models, both conditional and unconditional,contain approximately one billion parameters and successfully generatehigh-quality 3D shapes at $256^3$ resolution. Moreover, WaLa offers rapidinference, producing shapes within two to four seconds depending on thecondition, despite the model's scale. We demonstrate state-of-the-artperformance across multiple datasets, with significant improvements ingeneration quality, diversity, and computational efficiency. We open-source ourcode and, to the best of our knowledge, release the largest pretrained 3Dgenerative models across different modalities.</description><author>Aditya Sanghi, Aliasghar Khani, Pradyumna Reddy, Arianna Rampini, Derek Cheung, Kamal Rahimi Malekshan, Kanika Madan, Hooman Shayani</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:49:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08017v1</guid></item><item><title>Odd-One-Out: Anomaly Detection by Comparing with Neighbors</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20099v2</link><description>This paper introduces a novel anomaly detection (AD) problem that focuses onidentifying `odd-looking' objects relative to the other instances in a givenscene. In contrast to the traditional AD benchmarks, anomalies in our task arescene-specific, defined by the regular instances that make up the majority.Since object instances may be only partly visible from a single viewpoint, oursetting employs multiple views of each scene as input. To provide a testbed forfuture research in this task, we introduce two benchmarks, ToysAD-8K andPartsAD-15K. We propose a novel method that constructs 3D object-centricrepresentations from multiple 2D views for each instance and detects theanomalous ones through a cross-instance comparison. We rigorously analyze ourmethod quantitatively and qualitatively on the presented benchmarks.</description><author>Ankan Bhunia, Changjian Li, Hakan Bilen</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:46:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20099v2</guid></item><item><title>Artistic Neural Style Transfer Algorithms with Activation Smoothing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08014v1</link><description>The works of Gatys et al. demonstrated the capability of Convolutional NeuralNetworks (CNNs) in creating artistic style images.

While models for speech-based PD detection have shownstrong performance, their interpretability remains underexplored. This studysystematically evaluates several explainability methods to identify PD-specificspeech features, aiming to support the development of accurate, interpretablemodels for clinical decision-making in PD diagnosis and monitoring. Ourmethodology involves (i) obtaining attributions and saliency maps usingmainstream interpretability techniques, (ii) quantitatively evaluating thefaithfulness of these maps and their combinations obtained via union andintersection through a range of established metrics, and (iii) assessing theinformation conveyed by the saliency maps for PD detection from an auxiliaryclassifier.

Traditional approaches proceed by discretizing $\Lambda$ andsolving a series of optimization problems. We propose an alternative approachthat parameterizes the solution path with a set of basis functions and solves a\emph{single} stochastic optimization problem to learn the entire solutionpath. Our method offers substantial complexity improvements overdiscretization. When using constant-step size SGD, the uniform error of ourlearned solution path relative to the true path exhibits linear convergence toa constant related to the expressiveness of the basis. When the true solutionpath lies in the span of the basis, this constant is zero. We also provestronger results for special cases common in machine learning: When $\lambda\in [-1, 1]$ and the solution path is $\nu$-times differentiable, constantstep-size SGD learns a path with $\epsilon$ uniform error after at most$O(\epsilon^{\frac{1}{1-\nu}} \log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations, and when thesolution path is analytic, it only requires$O\left(\log^2(1/\epsilon)\log\log(1/\epsilon)\right)$. By comparison, thebest-known discretization schemes in these settings require at least$O(\epsilon^{-1/2})$ discretization points (and even more gradient calls).Finally, we propose an adaptive variant of our method that sequentially addsbasis functions and demonstrates strong numerical performance throughexperiments.</description><author>Qiran Dong, Paul Grigas, Vishal Gupta</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:42:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14885v2</guid></item><item><title>ExpressivityArena: Can LLMs Express Information Implicitly?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08010v1</link><description>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performancein certain dimensions, their ability to express implicit language cues thathuman use for effective communication remains unclear. This paper presentsExpressivityArena, a Python library for measuring the implicit communicationabilities of LLMs. We provide a comprehensive framework to evaluateexpressivity of arbitrary LLMs and explore its practical implications. To thisend, we refine the definition and measurements of ``expressivity,'' and use ourframework in a set of small experiments. These experiments test LLMs increative and logical tasks such as poetry, coding, and emotion-based responses.They are then evaluated by an automated grader, through ExpressivityArena,which we verify to be the most pragmatic for testing expressivity. Building onthese experiments, we deepen our understanding of the expressivity of LLMs byassessing their ability to remain expressive in conversations. Our findingsindicate that LLMs are capable of generating and understanding expressivecontent, however, with some limitations. These insights will inform the futuredevelopment and deployment of expressive LLMs. We provide the code forExpressivityArena alongside our paper.</description><author>Joshua Tint, Som Sagar, Aditya Taparia, Kelly Raines, Bimsara Pathiraja, Caleb Liu, Ransalu Senanayake</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:35:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08010v1</guid></item><item><title>Can adversarial attacks by large language models be attributed?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08003v1</link><description>Attributing outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) in adversarialsettings-such as cyberattacks and disinformation-presents significantchallenges that are likely to grow in importance. We investigate thisattribution problem using formal language theory, specifically languageidentification in the limit as introduced by Gold and extended by Angluin. Bymodeling LLM outputs as formal languages, we analyze whether finite textsamples can uniquely pinpoint the originating model. Our results show that dueto the non-identifiability of certain language classes, under some mildassumptions about overlapping outputs from fine-tuned models it istheoretically impossible to attribute outputs to specific LLMs with certainty.This holds also when accounting for expressivity limitations of Transformerarchitectures. Even with direct model access or comprehensive monitoring,significant computational hurdles impede attribution efforts. These findingshighlight an urgent need for proactive measures to mitigate risks posed byadversarial LLM use as their influence continues to expand.</description><author>Manuel Cebrian, Jan Arne Telle</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:28:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08003v1</guid></item><item><title>VQC-Based Reinforcement Learning with Data Re-uploading: Performance and Trainability</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11555v2</link><description>Reinforcement Learning (RL) consists of designing agents that makeintelligent decisions without human supervision. When used alongside functionapproximators such as Neural Networks (NNs), RL is capable of solving extremelycomplex problems. Deep Q-Learning, a RL algorithm that uses Deep NNs, achievedsuper-human performance in some specific tasks. Nonetheless, it is alsopossible to use Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) as function approximatorsin RL algorithms. This work empirically studies the performance andtrainability of such VQC-based Deep Q-Learning models in classic controlbenchmark environments. More specifically, we research how data re-uploadingaffects both these metrics. We show that the magnitude and the variance of thegradients of these models remain substantial throughout training due to themoving targets of Deep Q-Learning. Moreover, we empirically show thatincreasing the number of qubits does not lead to an exponential vanishingbehavior of the magnitude and variance of the gradients for a PQC approximatinga 2-design, unlike what was expected due to the Barren Plateau Phenomenon. Thishints at the possibility of VQCs being specially adequate for being used asfunction approximators in such a context.</description><author>Rodrigo Coelho, Andr√© Sequeira, Lu√≠s Paulo Santos</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:18:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11555v2</guid></item><item><title>Derivational Morphology Reveals Analogical Generalization in Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07990v1</link><description>What mechanisms underlie linguistic generalization in large language models(LLMs)? This question has attracted considerable attention, with most studiesanalyzing the extent to which the language skills of LLMs resemble rules. As ofyet, it is not known whether linguistic generalization in LLMs could equallywell be explained as the result of analogical processes, which can beformalized as similarity operations on stored exemplars. A key shortcoming ofprior research is its focus on linguistic phenomena with a high degree ofregularity, for which rule-based and analogical approaches make the samepredictions. Here, we instead examine derivational morphology, specificallyEnglish adjective nominalization, which displays notable variability. Weintroduce a new method for investigating linguistic generalization in LLMs:focusing on GPT-J, we fit cognitive models that instantiate rule-based andanalogical learning to the LLM training data and compare their predictions on aset of nonce adjectives with those of the LLM, allowing us to draw directconclusions regarding underlying mechanisms. As expected, rule-based andanalogical models explain the predictions of GPT-J equally well for adjectiveswith regular nominalization patterns. However, for adjectives with variablenominalization patterns, the analogical model provides a much better match.Furthermore, GPT-J's behavior is sensitive to the individual word frequencies,even for regular forms, a behavior that is consistent with an analogicalaccount of regular forms but not a rule-based one. These findings refute thehypothesis that GPT-J's linguistic generalization on adjective nominalizationinvolves rules, suggesting similarity operations on stored exemplars as theunderlying mechanism. Overall, our study suggests that analogical processesplay a bigger role in the linguistic generalization of LLMs than previouslythought.</description><author>Valentin Hofmann, Leonie Weissweiler, David Mortensen, Hinrich Sch√ºtze, Janet Pierrehumbert</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:15:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07990v1</guid></item><item><title>On the Utilization of Unique Node Identifiers in Graph Neural Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02271v2</link><description>Graph Neural Networks have inherent representational limitations due to theirmessage-passing structure.

Here we argue that despitethe advantages of UIDs, one of their disadvantages is that they lose thedesirable property of permutation-equivariance. We thus propose to focus on UIDmodels that are permutation-equivariant, and present theoretical arguments fortheir advantages. Motivated by this, we propose a method to regularize UIDmodels towards permutation equivariance, via a contrastive loss. We empiricallydemonstrate that our approach improves generalization and extrapolationabilities while providing faster training convergence.

Additionally, we demonstrate that selecting machinelearning training samples that closely match the distribution of the testingdataset is far more important than ensuring data diversity. Selection ofexemplary and iconic training samples with higher Gini coefficients leads tosignificantly better model performance compared to simply having a diversetraining set with lower Gini coefficients. Thus, Gini coefficients can serve aseffective criteria for selecting machine learning training samples, with ourselection method outperforming random sampling methods in very sparseinformation settings.</description><author>Ben Fauber</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:08:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07983v1</guid></item><item><title>Exact, Tractable Gauss-Newton Optimization in Deep Reversible Architectures Reveal Poor Generalization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07979v1</link><description>Second-order optimization has been shown to accelerate the training of deepneural networks in many applications, often yielding faster progress periteration on the training loss compared to first-order optimizers.However, thegeneralization properties of second-order methods are still being debated.Theoretical investigations have proved difficult to carry out outside thetractable settings of heavily simplified model classes -- thus, the relevanceof existing theories to practical deep learning applications remains unclear.Similarly, empirical studies in large-scale models and real datasets aresignificantly confounded by the necessity to approximate second-order updatesin practice. It is often unclear whether the observed generalization behaviourarises specifically from the second-order nature of the parameter updates, orinstead reflects the specific structured (e.g.\ Kronecker) approximations usedor any damping-based interpolation towards first-order updates. Here, we showfor the first time that exact Gauss-Newton (GN) updates take on a tractableform in a class of deep reversible architectures that are sufficientlyexpressive to be meaningfully applied to common benchmark datasets. We exploitthis novel setting to study the training and generalization properties of theGN optimizer. We find that exact GN generalizes poorly. In the mini-batchtraining setting, this manifests as rapidly saturating progress even on the\emph{training} loss, with parameter updates found to overfit eachmini-batchatch without producing the features that would support generalizationto other mini-batches. We show that our experiments run in the ``lazy'' regime,in which the neural tangent kernel (NTK) changes very little during the courseof training. This behaviour is associated with having no significant changes inneural representations, explaining the lack of generalization.</description><author>Davide Buffelli, Jamie McGowan, Wangkun Xu, Alexandru Cioba, Da-shan Shiu, Guillaume Hennequin, Alberto Bernacchia</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 17:58:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07979v1</guid></item><item><title>Doubly Robust Regression Discontinuity Designs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07978v1</link><description>This study introduces a doubly robust (DR) estimator for regressiondiscontinuity (RD) designs. In RD designs, treatment effects are estimated in aquasi-experimental setting where treatment assignment depends on whether arunning variable surpasses a predefined cutoff. A common approach in RDestimation is to apply nonparametric regression methods, such as local linearregression. In such an approach, the validity relies heavily on the consistencyof nonparametric estimators and is limited by the nonparametric convergencerate, thereby preventing $\sqrt{n}$-consistency. To address these issues, wepropose the DR-RD estimator, which combines two distinct estimators for theconditional expected outcomes. If either of these estimators is consistent, thetreatment effect estimator remains consistent.

Previous studies onrisk assessment and calcification detection in CT scans primarily useapproaches based on UNET architecture, frequently implemented on pre-builtmodels. However, these models are limited by the availability of annotated CTscans containing CAC and suffering from imbalanced dataset, decreasingperformance of CAC segmentation and scoring. In this study, we extend thisapproach by incorporating the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique of DINO(self-distillation with no labels) to eliminate limitations of scarce annotateddata in CT scans. The DINO model's ability to train without requiring CAC areaannotations enhances its robustness in generating distinct features. The DINOmodel is trained on to focus specifically on calcified areas by using labels,aiming to generate features that effectively capture and highlight keycharacteristics. The label-guided DINO (DINO-LG) enhances classification bydistinguishing CT slices that contain calcification from those that do not,performing 57% better than the standard DINO model in this task. CAC scoringand segmentation tasks are performed by a basic U-NET architecture, fedspecifically with CT slices containing calcified areas as identified by theDINO-LG model. This targeted identification performed by DINO-LG model improvesCAC segmentation performance by approximately 10% and significant increase inCAC scoring accuracy.</description><author>Mahmut S.

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is one such disease thatrequires careful ventilator operation to be effectively treated. In this work,we frame the management of ventilators for patients with ARDS as a sequentialdecision making problem using the Markov decision process framework. Weimplement and compare controllers based on clinical guidelines contained in theARDSnet protocol, optimal control theory, and learned latent dynamicsrepresented as neural networks. The Pulse Physiology Engine's respiratorydynamics simulator is used to establish a repeatable benchmark, gathersimulated data, and quantitatively compare these controllers.

In this work, we propose Fourierapproximations of persistence curves (FAPC), and use this technique to performsleep staging based on airflow signals. We analyze performance using an XGBoostmodel on 1155 pediatric sleep studies taken from the Nationwide Children'sHospital Sleep DataBank (NCHSDB), and find that FAPC methods providecomplimentary information to HEPC methods alone, leading to a 4.9% increase inperformance over baseline methods.</description><author>Shashank Manjunath, Hau-Tieng Wu, Aarti Sathyanarayana</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 17:41:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07964v1</guid></item><item><title>From General to Specific: Utilizing General Hallucation to Automatically Measure the Role Relationship Fidelity for Specific Role-Play Agents</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07965v1</link><description>The advanced role-playing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) havepaved the way for developing Role-Playing Agents (RPAs).

One of the key instruments is an all-sky infraredcamera array using eight uncooled long-wave infrared FLIR Boson 640 cameras.Their calibration includes a novel extrinsic calibration method using airplanepositions from Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Weestablish a first baseline for the system performance over five months of fieldoperation, using a real-world dataset derived from ADS-B data, synthetic 3-Dtrajectories, and a hand-labelled real-world dataset. We report acceptancerates (e.g. viewable airplanes that are recorded) and detection efficiencies(e.g. recorded airplanes which are successfully detected) for a variety ofweather conditions, range and aircraft size. We reconstruct $\sim$500,000trajectories of aerial objects from this commissioning period. A toy outliersearch focused on large sinuosity of the 2-D reconstructed trajectories flagsabout 16% of trajectories as outliers. After manual review, 144 trajectoriesremain ambiguous: they are likely mundane objects but cannot be elucidated atthis stage of development without distance and kinematics estimation or othersensor modalities. Our observed count of ambiguous outliers combined withsystematic uncertainties yields an upper limit of 18,271 outliers count for thefive-month interval at a 95% confidence level.

Empirically, modern SAT solvers producerelatively short proofs, however, there are no inherent guarantees that theseproofs cannot be significantly reduced. This paper proposes a novelbranch-and-bound algorithm for finding the shortest resolution proofs; to thisend, we introduce a layer list representation of proofs that groups clauses bytheir level of indirection. As we show, this representation breaks allpermutational symmetries, thereby improving upon the state-of-the-artsymmetry-breaking and informing the design of a novel workflow for proofminimization. In addition to that, we design pruning procedures that reason onproof length lower bound, clause subsumption, and dominance. Our experimentssuggest that the proofs from state-of-the-art solvers could be shortened by30-60% on the instances from SAT Competition 2002 and by 25-50% on smallsynthetic formulas.

Theframework trains a dual-branch disentanglement network to minimize mutualinformation (MI) between representations of point cloud content and distortion.Specifically, to fully disentangle representations, the two branches adoptdifferent philosophies: the content-aware encoder is pretrained by a maskedauto-encoding strategy, which can allow the encoder to capture semanticinformation from rendered images of distorted point clouds; thedistortion-aware encoder takes a mini-patch map as input, which forces theencoder to focus on low-level distortion patterns.

From a generalization perspective, this issue can beattributed to the over-generalization of value functions or policies towardsout-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Significant efforts have been devoted tomitigating such generalization, and recent in-sample learning approaches havefurther succeeded in entirely eschewing it. Nevertheless, we show that mildgeneralization beyond the dataset can be trusted and leveraged to improveperformance under certain conditions. To appropriately exploit generalizationin offline RL, we propose Doubly Mild Generalization (DMG), comprising (i) mildaction generalization and (ii) mild generalization propagation. The formerrefers to selecting actions in a close neighborhood of the dataset to maximizethe Q values. Even so, the potential erroneous generalization can still bepropagated, accumulated, and exacerbated by bootstrapping. In light of this,the latter concept is introduced to mitigate the generalization propagationwithout impeding the propagation of RL learning signals. Theoretically, DMGguarantees better performance than the in-sample optimal policy in the oraclegeneralization scenario. Even under worst-case generalization, DMG can stillcontrol value overestimation at a certain level and lower bound theperformance. Empirically, DMG achieves state-of-the-art performance acrossGym-MuJoCo locomotion tasks and challenging AntMaze tasks. Moreover, benefitingfrom its flexibility in both generalization aspects, DMG enjoys a seamlesstransition from offline to online learning and attains strong onlinefine-tuning performance.</description><author>Yixiu Mao, Qi Wang, Yun Qu, Yuhang Jiang, Xiangyang Ji</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 17:04:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07934v1</guid></item><item><title>Prediction of Acoustic Communication Performance for AUVs using Gaussian Process Classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07933v1</link><description>Cooperating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) often rely on acousticcommunication to coordinate their actions effectively. However, the reliabilityof underwater acoustic communication decreases as the communication rangebetween vehicles increases. Consequently, teams of cooperating AUVs typicallymake conservative assumptions about the maximum range at which they cancommunicate reliably. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approachthat involves learning a map representing the probability of successfulcommunication based on the locations of the transmitting and receivingvehicles. This probabilistic communication map accounts for factors such as therange between vehicles, environmental noise, and multi-path effects at a givenlocation. In pursuit of this goal, we investigate the application of Gaussianprocess binary classification to generate the desired communication map. Wespecialize existing results to this specific binary classification problem andexplore methods to incorporate uncertainty in vehicle location into the mappingprocess. Furthermore, we compare the prediction performance of the probabilitycommunication map generated using binary classification with that of asignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) communication map generated using Gaussian processregression.

However, prior calibrationmethods, such as self-consistency-based and logit-based approaches, are eitherlimited in inference-time efficiency or fall short of providing informativesignals. Moreover, simply filtering out low-confidence responses reduces theLM's helpfulness when the answers are correct. Therefore, effectively usingcalibration techniques to enhance an LM's factuality remains an unsolvedchallenge. In this paper, we first propose an activation-based calibrationmethod, ActCab, which trains a linear layer on top of the LM's last-layeractivations that can better capture the representations of knowledge. Built ontop of ActCab, we further propose CoDec, a confidence-guided decoding strategyto elicit truthful answers with high confidence from LMs. By evaluating on fivepopular QA benchmarks, ActCab achieves superior calibration performance thanall competitive baselines, e.g., by reducing the average expected calibrationerror (ECE) score by up to 39%. Further experiments on CoDec show consistentimprovements in several LMs' factuality on challenging QA datasets, such asTruthfulQA, highlighting the value of confidence signals in enhancingfactuality.</description><author>Xin Liu, Farima Fatahi Bayat, Lu Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:47:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13230v2</guid></item><item><title>Advanced User Credit Risk Prediction Model using LightGBM, XGBoost and Tabnet with SMOTEENN</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03497v2</link><description>Bank credit risk is a significant challenge in modern financial transactions,and the ability to identify qualified credit card holders among a large numberof applicants is crucial for the profitability of a bank'sbank's credit cardbusiness.

However, most existing methods encounter an accuracy-timeliness dilemma:Content-only methods guarantee timeliness but perform moderately because oflimited available information, while social con-text-based ones generallyperform better but inevitably lead to latency because of social contextaccumulation needs. To break such a dilemma, a feasible but not well-studiedsolution is to leverage social contexts (e.g., comments) from historical newsfor training a detection model and apply it to newly emerging news withoutsocial contexts. This requires the model to (1) sufficiently learn helpfulknowledge from social contexts, and (2) be well compatible with situations thatsocial contexts are available or not. To achieve this goal, we propose toabsorb and parameterize useful knowledge from comments in historical news andthen inject it into a content-only detection model. Specifically, we design theComments ASsisted FakE News Detection method (CAS-FEND), which transfers usefulknowledge from a comment-aware teacher model to a content-only student modeland detects newly emerging news with the student model. Experiments show thatthe CAS-FEND student model outperforms all content-only methods and evencomment-aware ones with 1/4 comments as inputs, demonstrating its superiorityfor early detection.</description><author>Qiong Nan, Qiang Sheng, Juan Cao, Yongchun Zhu, Danding Wang, Guang Yang, Jintao Li</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:39:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10429v2</guid></item><item><title>Meta-Learned Modality-Weighted Knowledge Distillation for Robust Multi-Modal Learning with Missing Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07155v2</link><description>In multi-modal learning, some modalities are more influential than others,and their absence can have a significant impact on classification/segmentationaccuracy. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel approach calledMeta-learned Modality-weighted Knowledge Distillation (MetaKD), which enablesmulti-modal models to maintain high accuracy even when key modalities aremissing. MetaKD adaptively estimates the importance weight of each modalitythrough a meta-learning process. These learned importance weights guide apairwise modality-weighted knowledge distillation process, allowinghigh-importance modalities to transfer knowledge to lower-importance ones,resulting in robust performance despite missing inputs. Unlike previous methodsin the field, which are often task-specific and require significantmodifications, our approach is designed to work in multiple tasks (e.g.,segmentation and classification) with minimal adaptation. Experimental resultson five prevalent datasets, including three Brain Tumor Segmentation datasets(BraTS2018, BraTS2019 and BraTS2020), the Alzheimer's Disease NeuroimagingInitiative (ADNI) classification dataset and the Audiovision-MNISTclassification dataset, demonstrate the proposed model is able to outperformthe compared models by a large margin.</description><author>Hu Wang, Salma Hassan, Yuyuan Liu, Congbo Ma, Yuanhong Chen, Yutong Xie, Mostafa Salem, Yu Tian, Jodie Avery, Louise Hull, Ian Reid, Mohammad Yaqub, Gustavo Carneiro</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:39:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07155v2</guid></item><item><title>How Do Large Language Models Acquire Factual Knowledge During Pretraining?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11813v3</link><description>Despite the recent observation that large language models (LLMs) can storesubstantial factual knowledge, there is a limited understanding of themechanisms of how they acquire factual knowledge through pretraining. This workaddresses this gap by studying how LLMs acquire factual knowledge duringpretraining. The findings reveal several important insights into the dynamicsof factual knowledge acquisition during pretraining. First, counterintuitively,we observe that pretraining on more data shows no significant improvement inthe model's capability to acquire and maintain factual knowledge. Next, thereis a power-law relationship between training steps and forgetting ofmemorization and generalization of factual knowledge, and LLMs trained withduplicated training data exhibit faster forgetting. Third, training LLMs withlarger batch sizes can enhance the models' robustness to forgetting. Overall,our observations suggest that factual knowledge acquisition in LLM pretrainingoccurs by progressively increasing the probability of factual knowledgepresented in the pretraining data at each step. However, this increase isdiluted by subsequent forgetting. Based on this interpretation, we demonstratethat we can provide plausible explanations for recently observed behaviors ofLLMs, such as the poor performance of LLMs on long-tail knowledge and thebenefits of deduplicating the pretraining corpus.</description><author>Hoyeon Chang, Jinho Park, Seonghyeon Ye, Sohee Yang, Youngkyung Seo, Du-Seong Chang, Minjoon Seo</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:38:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11813v3</guid></item><item><title>Levin Tree Search with Context Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16945v3</link><description>Levin Tree Search (LTS) is a search algorithm that makes use of a policy (aprobability distribution over actions) and comes with a theoretical guaranteeon the number of expansions before reaching a goal node, depending on thequality of the policy. This guarantee can be used as a loss function, which wecall the LTS loss, to optimize neural networks representing the policy(LTS+NN). In this work we show that the neural network can be substituted withparameterized context models originating from the online compression literature(LTS+CM). We show that the LTS loss is convex under this new model, whichallows for using standard convex optimization tools, and obtain convergenceguarantees to the optimal parameters in an online setting for a given set ofsolution trajectories -- guarantees that cannot be provided for neuralnetworks. The new LTS+CM algorithm compares favorably against LTS+NN on severalbenchmarks: Sokoban (Boxoban), The Witness, and the 24-Sliding Tile puzzle(STP). The difference is particularly large on STP, where LTS+NN fails to solvemost of the test instances while LTS+CM solves each test instance in a fractionof a second. Furthermore, we show that LTS+CM is able to learn a policy thatsolves the Rubik's cube in only a few hundred expansions, which considerablyimproves upon previous machine learning techniques.</description><author>Laurent Orseau, Marcus Hutter, Levi H.

To address theseissues, this paper proposes a novel approach by merging two widely useddatasets, LISA and S2TLD. The merged dataset is further processed to tackleclass imbalance, a common problem in this domain. This merged dataset becomesour source domain. Synthetic rain and fog are added to the dataset to createour target domain. We employ Fourier Domain Adaptation (FDA) to create a finaldataset with a minimized domain gap between the two datasets, helping the modeltrained on this final dataset adapt to rainy and foggy weather conditions.Additionally, we explore Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques to leveragethe available data more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate thatmodels trained on FDA-augmented images outperform those trained without FDAacross confidence-dependent and independent metrics, like mAP50, mAP50-95,Precision, and Recall. The best-performing model, YOLOv8, achieved a Precisionincrease of 5.1860%, Recall increase of 14.8009%, mAP50 increase of 9.5074%,and mAP50-95 increase of 19.5035%.

At the forefront of this change is pointcloud technology, offering an immersive experience that surpasses traditional2D representations. However, the massive data size of point clouds presentssignificant challenges in data compression. Current methods for lossy pointcloud attribute compression (PCAC) generally focus on reconstructing theoriginal point clouds with minimal error. However, for point cloudvisualization scenarios, the reconstructed point clouds with distortion stillneed to undergo a complex rendering process, which affects the finaluser-perceived quality. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learningframework that seamlessly integrates PCAC with differentiable rendering,denoted as rendering-oriented PCAC (RO-PCAC), directly targeting the quality ofrendered multiview images for viewing. In a differentiable manner, the impactof the rendering process on the reconstructed point clouds is taken intoaccount. Moreover, we characterize point clouds as sparse tensors and propose asparse tensor-based transformer, called SP-Trans. By aligning with the localdensity of the point cloud and utilizing an enhanced local attention mechanism,SP-Trans captures the intricate relationships within the point cloud, furtherimproving feature analysis and synthesis within the framework.

The current study is an extension of thisclassic result, proving that the aforementioned properties extend to themin-norm solution map $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$, where$\mathbf{y}$ is the observed signal, for a generalization of LASSO termed thescaled generalized minimax concave (sGMC) model. The sGMC model adopts anonconvex debiased variant of the $\ell_1$-norm as sparse regularizer, but itsobjective function is overall-convex. Based on the geometric properties of$\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$, we propose an extension of the leastangle regression (LARS) algorithm, which iteratively computes the closed-formexpression of $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$ in each linear zone.Under suitable conditions, the proposed algorithm provably obtains the wholesolution map $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$ within finite iterations.Notably, our proof techniques for establishing continuity and piecewiselinearity of $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$ are novel, and they leadto two side contributions: (a) our proofs establish continuity of the sGMCsolution set as a set-valued mapping of $(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$; (b) to provepiecewise linearity and piecewise constant sparsity pattern of$\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$, we do not require any assumption thatprevious work relies on (whereas to prove some additional properties of$\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$, we use a different set of assumptionsfrom previous work).</description><author>Yi Zhang, Isao Yamada</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 15:57:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18438v3</guid></item><item><title>Mapping the Podcast Ecosystem with the Structured Podcast Research Corpus</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07892v1</link><description>Podcasts provide highly diverse content to a massive listener base through aunique on-demand modality.

These federated learning models may then be used to makeconsequential decisions, such as allocating healthcare resources. Two keychallenges emerge in this setting: (i) maintaining the privacy of each person'sdata, even if other silos or an adversary with access to the central servertries to infer this data; (ii) ensuring that decisions are fair to differentdemographic groups (e.g., race/gender). In this paper, we develop a novelalgorithm for private and fair federated learning (FL). Our algorithm satisfiesinter-silo record-level differential privacy (ISRL-DP), a strong notion ofprivate FL requiring that silo i's sent messages satisfy record-leveldifferential privacy for all i. Our framework can be used to promote differentfairness notions, including demographic parity and equalized odds. We provethat our algorithm converges under mild smoothness assumptions on the lossfunction, whereas prior work required strong convexity for convergence. As abyproduct of our analysis, we obtain the first convergence guarantee forISRL-DP nonconvex-strongly concave min-max FL. Experiments demonstrate thestate-of-the-art fairness-accuracy tradeoffs of our algorithm across differentprivacy levels.</description><author>Devansh Gupta, A. S.

This transformer-based framework uses linearpairwise loss with mutable training batch sizes and achieves quality gains andhigh efficiency, and has been applied effectively to show gains on two industrytasks at Microsoft over real-world large-scale data sets: Smart Reply (SR) andAmbient Clinical Intelligence (ACI). In Smart Reply, sRank assists livecustomers with technical support by selecting the best reply from predefinedsolutions based on consumer and support agent messages. It achieves 11.7% gainin offline top-one accuracy on the SR task over the previous system, and hasenabled 38.7% time reduction in composing messages in telemetry recorded sinceits general release in January 2021. In the ACI task, sRank selects relevanthistorical physician templates that serve as guidance for a text summarizationmodel to generate higher quality medical notes.

As with other softwareengineering artifacts, software models are subject to evolution. Supportingmodelers in evolving software models with recommendations for model completionsis still an open problem, though. In this paper, we explore the potential oflarge language models for this task. In particular, we propose an approach,RAMC, leveraging large language models, model histories, andretrieval-augmented generation for model completion. Through experiments onthree datasets, including an industrial application, one public open-sourcecommunity dataset, and one controlled collection of simulated modelrepositories, we evaluate the potential of large language models for modelcompletion with RAMC. We found that large language models are indeed apromising technology for supporting software model evolution (62.30%semantically correct completions on real-world industrial data and up to 86.19%type-correct completions). The general inference capabilities of large languagemodels are particularly useful when dealing with concepts for which there arefew, noisy, or no examples at all.</description><author>Christof Tinnes, Alisa Welter, Sven Apel</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 15:39:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17651v3</guid></item><item><title>An Early FIRST Reproduction and Improvements to Single-Token Decoding for Fast Listwise Reranking</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05508v2</link><description>Recent advances have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) excel aslistwise rerankers, but their high computational demands remain a barrier towidespread adoption. Further, the traditional language modeling (LM) objectiveis not ideally suited for reranking tasks. FIRST is a novel approach thataddresses these challenges by integrating a learning-to-rank objective andleveraging the logits of only the first generated token, thereby significantlyreducing inference latency compared to traditional LLM rerankers. In thisstudy, we extend the evaluation of FIRST to the TREC Deep Learning datasets(DL19-22), validating its robustness across diverse domains. We investigate theinfluence of different first-stage retrievers on FIRST rerankers, observingdiminishing returns and patterns consistent with traditional LLM rerankers.Through applying the FIRST objective to a broader range of backbone models, weachieve effectiveness surpassing the original implementation. Our experimentsconfirm that fast reranking with single-token logits does not compromiseout-of-domain reranking quality. To better quantify the computational savingsin the original study, we measure and compare latency to find a 21%-42% gainacross various models and benchmarks. Moreover, while LM training implicitlyimproves zero-shot single-token reranking, our experiments also raise questionsabout whether LM pre-training may hinder subsequent fine-tuning with the FIRSTobjective. These findings pave the way for more efficient and effectivelistwise reranking in future applications.</description><author>Zijian Chen, Ronak Pradeep, Jimmy Lin</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 15:36:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05508v2</guid></item><item><title>Provable Compositional Generalization for Object-Centric Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05327v2</link><description>Learning representations that generalize to novel compositions of knownconcepts is crucial for bridging the gap between human and machine perception.One prominent effort is learning object-centric representations, which arewidely conjectured to enable compositional generalization.

When the class values are ordinal, classifiers that takethis into account can perform better than nominal classifiers. Time SeriesOrdinal Classification (TSOC) is the field covering this gap, yet unexplored inthe literature. There are a wide range of time series problems showing anordered label structure, and TSC techniques that ignore the order relationshipdiscard useful information. Hence, this paper presents a first benchmarking ofTSOC methodologies, exploiting the ordering of the target labels to boost theperformance of current TSC state-of-the-art. Both convolutional- and deeplearning-based methodologies (among the best performing alternatives fornominal TSC) are adapted for TSOC. For the experiments, a selection of 29ordinal problems from two well-known archives has been made. In this way, thispaper contributes to the establishment of the state-of-the-art in TSOC.

B2B operator learning circumvents many challenges of priorworks, such as requiring data to be at fixed locations, by leveraging classictechniques such as least squares to compute the coefficients.

We investigate whether moderngenerative models can similarly learn underlying rules from finite samples andperform reasoning through conditional sampling. Inspired by Raven's ProgressiveMatrices task, we designed GenRAVEN dataset, where each sample consists ofthree rows, and one of 40 relational rules governing the object position,number, or attributes applies to all rows. We trained generative models tolearn the data distribution, where samples are encoded as integer arrays tofocus on rule learning. We compared two generative model families: diffusion(EDM, DiT, SiT) and autoregressive models (GPT2, Mamba). We evaluated theirability to generate structurally consistent samples and perform panelcompletion via unconditional and conditional sampling. We found diffusionmodels excel at unconditional generation, producing more novel and consistentsamples from scratch and memorizing less, but performing less well in panelcompletion, even with advanced conditional sampling methods. Conversely,autoregressive models excel at completing missing panels in a rule-consistentmanner but generate less consistent samples unconditionally. We observe diversedata scaling behaviors: for both model families, rule learning emerges at acertain dataset size - around 1000s examples per rule. With more training data,diffusion models improve both their unconditional and conditional generationcapabilities. However, for autoregressive models, while panel completionimproves with more training data, unconditional generation consistencydeclines. Our findings highlight complementary capabilities and limitations ofdiffusion and autoregressive models in rule learning and reasoning tasks,suggesting avenues for further research into their mechanisms and potential forhuman-like reasoning.</description><author>Binxu Wang, Jiaqi Shang, Haim Sompolinsky</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 15:29:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07873v1</guid></item><item><title>Leveraging Multimodal Models for Enhanced Neuroimaging Diagnostics in Alzheimer's Disease</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07871v1</link><description>The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-LanguageModels (VLMs) have shown great potential in medical diagnostics, particularlyin radiology, where datasets such as X-rays are paired with human-generateddiagnostic reports.

We observe asimilar behavior in large language models (LLMs), which we term "VerbosityCompensation" (VC). VC is harmful because it confuses the user understanding,leading to low efficiency, and influences the LLM services by increasing thelatency and cost of generating useless tokens. In this paper, we present thefirst work that defines and analyzes Verbosity Compensation, explores itscauses, and proposes a simple mitigating approach. We define VerbosityCompensation as the behavior of generating responses that can be compressedwithout information loss when prompted to write concisely. Our experiments,conducted on five datasets of knowledge and reasoning-based QA tasks with 14newly developed LLMs, reveal three conclusions. 1) We reveal a pervasivepresence of verbosity compensation across all models and all datasets. Notably,GPT-4 exhibits a VC frequency of 50.40%. 2) We reveal the large performance gapbetween verbose and concise responses, with a notable difference of 27.61% onthe Qasper dataset. We also demonstrate that this difference does not naturallydiminish as LLM capability increases. Both 1) and 2) highlight the urgent needto mitigate the frequency of VC behavior and disentangle verbosity withveracity. We propose a simple yet effective cascade algorithm that replaces theverbose responses with the other model-generated responses. The results showthat our approach effectively alleviates the VC of the Mistral model from63.81% to 16.16% on the Qasper dataset. 3) We also find that verbose responsesexhibit higher uncertainty across all five datasets, suggesting a strongconnection between verbosity and model uncertainty.

Despiteits promising performance, the approach encounters two key limitations: simplyrelying on the few annotated samples for CIR model training andindiscriminately selecting training triplets for CIR model fine-tuning. Toaddress these two limitations, we propose a novel two-stage pseudo tripletguided few-shot CIR scheme, dubbed PTG-FSCIR.

However, this task istypically more challenging than other regression tasks due to the censoredobservations. Moreover, concerns regarding the reliability of predictionspersist among clinicians, mainly attributed to the absence of confidenceassessment, robustness, and calibration of prediction. To address thosechallenges, we introduce an evidential regression model designed especially fortime-to-event prediction tasks, with which the most plausible event time, isdirectly quantified by aggregated Gaussian random fuzzy numbers (GRFNs). TheGRFNs are a newly introduced family of random fuzzy subsets of the real linethat generalizes both Gaussian random variables and Gaussian possibilitydistributions. Different from conventional methods that construct models basedon strict data distribution, e.g., proportional hazard function, our model onlyassumes the event time is encoded in a real line GFRN without any strictdistribution assumption, therefore offering more flexibility in complex datascenarios. Furthermore, the epistemic and aleatory uncertainty regarding theevent time is quantified within the aggregated GRFN as well. Our model can,therefore, provide more detailed clinical decision-making guidance with twomore degrees of information. The model is fit by minimizing a generalizednegative log-likelihood function that accounts for data censoring based onuncertainty evidence reasoning.

While adversarialattacks have been extensively studied in continuous data domains such asimages, the discrete nature of text presents unique challenges. In this paper,we propose Irony-based Adversarial Examples (IAE), a method that transformsstraightforward sentences into ironic ones to create adversarial text. Thisapproach exploits the rhetorical device of irony, where the intended meaning isopposite to the literal interpretation, requiring a deeper understanding ofcontext to detect. The IAE method is particularly challenging due to the needto accurately locate evaluation words, substitute them with appropriatecollocations, and expand the text with suitable ironic elements whilemaintaining semantic coherence.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that combinesthe performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and the sample efficiency ofImitation Learning (IL) in the task of vision-based autonomous drone racing.While RL provides a framework for learning high-performance controllers throughtrial and error, it faces challenges with sample efficiency and computationaldemands due to the high dimensionality of visual inputs. Conversely, ILefficiently learns from visual expert demonstrations, but it remains limited bythe expert's performance and state distribution. To overcome these limitations,our policy learning framework integrates the strengths of both approaches. Ourframework contains three phases: training a teacher policy using RL withprivileged state information, distilling it into a student policy via IL, andadaptive fine-tuning via RL. Testing in both simulated and real-world scenariosshows our approach can not only learn in scenarios where RL from scratch failsbut also outperforms existing IL methods in both robustness and performance,successfully navigating a quadrotor through a race course using only visualinformation.

Our model assumes that one action, corresponding to the learner'sabstention from play, has no reward or loss on every trial. We propose the CBAalgorithm, which exploits this assumption to obtain reward bounds that cansignificantly improve those of the classical Exp4 algorithm. We can view ourproblem as the aggregation of confidence-rated predictors when the learner hasthe option of abstention from play. Importantly, we are the first to achievebounds on the expected cumulative reward for general confidence-ratedpredictors. In the special case of specialists we achieve a novel reward bound,significantly improving previous bounds of SpecialistExp (treating abstentionas another action). As an example application, we discuss learning unions ofballs in a finite metric space. In this contextual setting, we devise anefficient implementation of CBA, reducing the runtime from quadratic to almostlinear in the number of contexts. Preliminary experiments show that CBAimproves over existing bandit algorithms.</description><author>Stephen Pasteris, Alberto Rumi, Maximilian Thiessen, Shota Saito, Atsushi Miyauchi, Fabio Vitale, Mark Herbster</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 14:58:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14585v2</guid></item><item><title>REVEX: A Unified Framework for Removal-Based Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Video</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11796v2</link><description>We developed REVEX, a removal-based video explanations framework.

Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complexcommands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs foron-device control presents significant challenges due to limited dataavailability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introducesDistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RLfine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralizedtraining and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning inthe context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework isbacked by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances explorationwith the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robusttraining. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3Ximprovement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4Xfaster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, aftertraining, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate comparedto state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark,significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the sametraining time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficientsolution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency andagent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.</description><author>Taiyi Wang, Zhihao Wu, Jianheng Liu, Jianye Hao, Jun Wang, Kun Shao</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 14:57:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14803v3</guid></item><item><title>Transfer Learning for Wildlife Classification: Evaluating YOLOv8 against DenseNet, ResNet, and VGGNet on a Custom Dataset</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00002v2</link><description>This study evaluates the performance of various deep learning models,specifically DenseNet, ResNet, VGGNet, and YOLOv8, for wildlife speciesclassification on a custom dataset.

In this paper, we propose PathWeave, a flexible and scalableframework with modal-Path sWitching and ExpAnsion abilities that enables MLLMsto continually EVolve on modalities for $\mathbb{X}$-modal reasoning. Weleverage the concept of Continual Learning and develop an incremental trainingstrategy atop pre-trained MLLMs, enabling their expansion to new modalitiesusing uni-modal data, without executing joint-modal pretraining. In detail, anovel Adapter-in-Adapter (AnA) framework is introduced, in which uni-modal andcross-modal adapters are seamlessly integrated to facilitate efficient modalityalignment and collaboration. Additionally, an MoE-based gating module isapplied between two types of adapters to further enhance the multimodalinteraction. To investigate the proposed method, we establish a challengingbenchmark called Continual Learning of Modality (MCL), which consists ofhigh-quality QA data from five distinct modalities: image, video, audio, depthand point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of theproposed AnA framework on learning plasticity and memory stability duringcontinual learning.

A significant portion of this memory is typically consumed by theoptimizer state. To overcome this challenge, recent approaches such as low-rankadaptation (LoRA (Hu et al., 2021)), low-rank gradient projection (GaLore (Zhaoet al., 2024)), and blockwise optimization (BAdam (Luo et al., 2024)) have beenproposed. However, in all these algorithms, the $\textit{effective rank of theweight updates remains low-rank}$, which can lead to a substantial loss ofinformation from the gradient. This loss can be critically important,especially during the pre-training stage. In this paper, we introduce$\texttt{FRUGAL}$ ($\textbf{F}$ull-$\textbf{R}$ank $\textbf{U}$pdates with$\textbf{G}$r$\textbf{A}$dient sp$\textbf{L}$itting), a new memory-efficientoptimization framework. $\texttt{FRUGAL}$ leverages gradient splitting toperform low-dimensional updates using advanced algorithms (such as Adam), whileupdates along the remaining directions are executed via state-free methods likeSGD or signSGD (Bernstein et al., 2018). Our framework can be integrated withvarious low-rank update selection techniques, including GaLore and BAdam. Weprovide theoretical convergence guarantees for our framework when using SGDMfor low-dimensional updates and SGD for state-free updates. Additionally, ourmethod consistently outperforms concurrent approaches across various fixedmemory budgets, achieving state-of-the-art results in pre-training andfine-tuning tasks while balancing memory efficiency and performance metrics.</description><author>Philip Zmushko, Aleksandr Beznosikov, Martin Tak√°ƒç, Samuel Horv√°th</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 14:41:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07837v1</guid></item><item><title>UniTE: A Survey and Unified Pipeline for Pre-training Spatiotemporal Trajectory Embeddings</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12550v2</link><description>Spatiotemporal trajectories are sequences of timestamped locations, whichenable a variety of analyses that in turn enable important real-worldapplications. It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings,before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are veryimportant. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeledtrajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promisingapplicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest.However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of acomprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several relatedmethods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline,complicating the development of new methods and the analysis of methods. We present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doingso, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-trainingtrajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly orimplicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified andmodular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying theprocess of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectoryembeddings.

Concurrently, the world is slowlyshifting its focus towards more sustainable computing. For these reasons, therehas been a recent effort to reduce the footprint of related computinginfrastructure, especially by deep learning algorithms, for advanced insightgeneration. The `TinyML' community is actively proposing methods to savecommunication bandwidth and excessive cloud storage costs while reducingalgorithm inference latency and promoting data privacy. Such proposedapproaches should ideally process multiple types of data, including timeseries, audio, satellite images, and video, near the network edge as multipledata streams has been shown to improve the discriminative ability of learningalgorithms, especially for generating fine grained results. Incidentally, therehas been recent work on data driven conditional computation of subnetworks thathas shown real progress in using a single model to share parameters among verydifferent types of inputs such as images and text, reducing the computationrequirement of multi-tower multimodal networks. Inspired by such line of work,we explore similar per patch conditional computation for the first time formobile vision transformers (vision only case), that will eventually be used forsingle-tower multimodal edge models. We evaluate the model on Cornell SapSucker Woods 60, a fine grained bird species discrimination dataset.

However, they suffer from performancedegradation in adverse weather conditions due to the quality deterioration ofLiDAR point clouds. Fusing LiDAR with the weather-robust 4D radar sensor isexpected to solve this problem. However, the fusion of LiDAR and 4D radar ischallenging because they differ significantly in terms of data quality and thedegree of degradation in adverse weather. To address these issues, we introduceL4DR, a weather-robust 3D object detection method that effectively achievesLiDAR and 4D Radar fusion. Our L4DR includes Multi-Modal Encoding (MME) andForeground-Aware Denoising (FAD) technique to reconcile sensor gaps, which isthe first exploration of the complementarity of early fusion between LiDAR and4D radar. Additionally, we design an Inter-Modal and Intra-Modal ({IM}2 )parallel feature extraction backbone coupled with a Multi-Scale Gated Fusion(MSGF) module to counteract the varying degrees of sensor degradation underadverse weather conditions. Experimental evaluation on a VoD dataset withsimulated fog proves that L4DR is more adaptable to changing weatherconditions. It delivers a significant performance increase under different foglevels, improving the 3D mAP by up to 20.0% over the traditional LiDAR-onlyapproach. Moreover, the results on the K-Radar dataset validate the consistentperformance improvement of L4DR in real-world adverse weather conditions.</description><author>Xun Huang, Ziyu Xu, Hai Wu, Jinlong Wang, Qiming Xia, Yan Xia, Jonathan Li, Kyle Gao, Chenglu Wen, Cheng Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 14:33:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03677v4</guid></item><item><title>The Dark Patterns of Personalized Persuasion in Large Language Models: Exposing Persuasive Linguistic Features for Big Five Personality Traits in LLMs Responses</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06008v2</link><description>This study explores how the Large Language Models (LLMs) adjust linguisticfeatures to create personalized persuasive outputs.

In this paper,we propose a novel framework to explore and exploit the powerful featurerepresentation and zero-shot generalization ability of the pre-trained SegmentAnything Model (SAM) for multi-modal SOD. Despite serving as a recent visionfundamental model, driving the class-agnostic SAM to comprehend and detectsalient objects accurately is non-trivial, especially in challenging scenes. Tothis end, we develop \underline{SAM} with se\underline{m}anticf\underline{e}ature fu\underline{s}ion guidanc\underline{e} (Sammese), whichincorporates multi-modal saliency-specific knowledge into SAM to adapt SAM tomulti-modal SOD tasks. However, it is difficult for SAM trained on single-modaldata to directly mine the complementary benefits of multi-modal inputs andcomprehensively utilize them to achieve accurate saliency prediction. Toaddress these issues, we first design a multi-modal complementary fusion moduleto extract robust multi-modal semantic features by integrating information fromvisible and thermal or depth image pairs. Then, we feed the extractedmulti-modal semantic features into both the SAM image encoder and mask decoderfor fine-tuning and prompting, respectively. Specifically, in the imageencoder, a multi-modal adapter is proposed to adapt the single-modal SAM tomulti-modal information. In the mask decoder, a semantic-geometric promptgeneration strategy is proposed to produce corresponding embeddings withvarious saliency cues.

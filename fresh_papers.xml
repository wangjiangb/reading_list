Furthermore, this typicallyinvolves optimization through differentiable Monte Carlo rendering, which isbrittle and computationally-expensive. In this work, we propose a simplerapproach: we first relight each input image using an image diffusion modelconditioned on lighting and then reconstruct a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)with these relit images, from which we render novel views under the targetlighting. We demonstrate that this strategy is surprisingly competitive andachieves state-of-the-art results on multiple relighting benchmarks.

Recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) hasemerged as a highly efficient alternative for object-level 3D generation.However, adapting 3D-GS from finite-scale 3D objects and humans toinfinite-scale 3D cities is non-trivial. Unbounded 3D city generation entailssignificant storage overhead (out-of-memory issues), arising from the need toexpand points to billions, often demanding hundreds of Gigabytes of VRAM for acity scene spanning 10km^2. In this paper, we propose GaussianCity, agenerative Gaussian Splatting framework dedicated to efficiently synthesizingunbounded 3D cities with a single feed-forward pass. Our key insights aretwo-fold: 1) Compact 3D Scene Representation: We introduce BEV-Point as ahighly compact intermediate representation, ensuring that the growth in VRAMusage for unbounded scenes remains constant, thus enabling unbounded citygeneration. 2) Spatial-aware Gaussian Attribute Decoder: We presentspatial-aware BEV-Point decoder to produce 3D Gaussian attributes, whichleverages Point Serializer to integrate the structural and contextualcharacteristics of BEV points. Extensive experiments demonstrate thatGaussianCity achieves state-of-the-art results in both drone-view andstreet-view 3D city generation. Notably, compared to CityDreamer, GaussianCityexhibits superior performance with a speedup of 60 times (10.72 FPS v.s. 0.18FPS).</description><author>Haozhe Xie, Zhaoxi Chen, Fangzhou Hong, Ziwei Liu</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 18:59:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06526v1</guid></item><item><title>CounterCurate: Enhancing Physical and Semantic Visio-Linguistic Compositional Reasoning via Counterfactual Examples</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13254v3</link><description>We propose CounterCurate, a framework to comprehensively improve thevisio-linguistic compositional reasoning capability for both contrastive andgenerative multimodal models. In particular, we identify two criticalunder-explored problems: the neglect of the physically grounded reasoning(counting and position understanding) and the potential of using highly capabletext and image generation models for semantic counterfactual fine-tuning. Ourwork pioneers an approach that addresses these gaps. We first spotlight thenear-chance performance of multimodal models like CLIP and LLaVA in physicallygrounded compositional reasoning. We then apply simple data augmentation usinggrounded image generation model GLIGEN to generate fine-tuning data, resultingin significant performance improvements: +33% and +37% for CLIP and LLaVA,respectively, on our newly curated Flickr30k-Positions benchmark. Moreover, weexploit the capabilities of high-performing text generation and imagegeneration models, specifically GPT-4V and DALLE-3, to curate challengingsemantic counterfactuals, thereby further enhancing compositional reasoningcapabilities on benchmarks such as SugarCrepe, where CounterCurate outperformsGPT-4V.

Our approach utilizes homographyto model global motion and employs multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to capturelocal residual deformations, enhancing the model's ability to handle complexvideo dynamics. By introducing a diffusion prior from the early stages oftraining, our model ensures that the generated images retain a high-qualitynatural appearance, making the produced canonical images suitable for variousdownstream tasks in video editing, a capability not achieved by currentcanonical-based methods. Furthermore, we incorporate low-rank adaptation (LoRA)fine-tuning and introduce a noise and diffusion prior update schedulingtechnique that accelerates the training process by 14 times.

This simple, intuitivemethodology allows autoregressive (AR) transformers to learn visualdistributions fast and generalize well: VAR, for the first time, makes GPT-likeAR models surpass diffusion transformers in image generation. On ImageNet256x256 benchmark, VAR significantly improve AR baseline by improving Frechetinception distance (FID) from 18.65 to 1.73, inception score (IS) from 80.4 to350.2, with around 20x faster inference speed. It is also empirically verifiedthat VAR outperforms the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in multiple dimensionsincluding image quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability.Scaling up VAR models exhibits clear power-law scaling laws similar to thoseobserved in LLMs, with linear correlation coefficients near -0.998 as solidevidence. VAR further showcases zero-shot generalization ability in downstreamtasks including image in-painting, out-painting, and editing.

Although manystudies on surface reconstruction based on 3DGS have emerged recently, thequality of their meshes is generally unsatisfactory. To address this problem,we propose a fast planar-based Gaussian splatting reconstruction representation(PGSR) to achieve high-fidelity surface reconstruction while ensuringhigh-quality rendering. Specifically, we first introduce an unbiased depthrendering method, which directly renders the distance from the camera origin tothe Gaussian plane and the corresponding normal map based on the Gaussiandistribution of the point cloud, and divides the two to obtain the unbiaseddepth. We then introduce single-view geometric, multi-view photometric, andgeometric regularization to preserve global geometric accuracy. We also proposea camera exposure compensation model to cope with scenes with largeillumination variations. Experiments on indoor and outdoor scenes show that ourmethod achieves fast training and rendering while maintaining high-fidelityrendering and geometric reconstruction, outperforming 3DGS-based and NeRF-basedmethods.</description><author>Danpeng Chen, Hai Li, Weicai Ye, Yifan Wang, Weijian Xie, Shangjin Zhai, Nan Wang, Haomin Liu, Hujun Bao, Guofeng Zhang</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 18:59:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06521v1</guid></item><item><title>Point-VOS: Pointing Up Video Object Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05917v2</link><description>Current state-of-the-art Video Object Segmentation (VOS) methods rely ondense per-object mask annotations both during training and testing. Thisrequires time-consuming and costly video annotation mechanisms. We propose anovel Point-VOS task with a spatio-temporally sparse point-wise annotationscheme that substantially reduces the annotation effort. We apply ourannotation scheme to two large-scale video datasets with text descriptions andannotate over 19M points across 133K objects in 32K videos. Based on ourannotations, we propose a new Point-VOS benchmark, and a correspondingpoint-based training mechanism, which we use to establish strong baselineresults. We show that existing VOS methods can easily be adapted to leverageour point annotations during training, and can achieve results close to thefully-supervised performance when trained on pseudo-masks generated from thesepoints. In addition, we show that our data can be used to improve models thatconnect vision and language, by evaluating it on the Video Narrative Grounding(VNG) task.

Relatively consistent TME characteristicsembedded within highly specific tissue features, render them difficult topredict. The capability to accurately classify TME subtypes is of criticalsignificance for clinical tumor diagnosis and precision medicine. Based on theobservation that tumors with different origins share similar microenvironmentpatterns, we propose PathoTME, a genomics-guided Siamese representationlearning framework employing Whole Slide Image (WSI) for pan-cancer TMEsubtypes prediction. Specifically, we utilize Siamese network to leveragegenomic information as a regularization factor to assist WSI embeddingslearning during the training phase. Additionally, we employ Domain AdversarialNeural Network (DANN) to mitigate the impact of tissue type variations. Toeliminate domain bias, a dynamic WSI prompt is designed to further unleash themodel's capabilities.

Given the currentradiologist shortage, there is a large impetus to use artificial intelligenceto alleviate the burden of interpreting these complex imaging studies. Priorstate-of-the-art approaches for automated medical image interpretation leveragevision language models (VLMs). However, current medical VLMs are generallylimited to 2D images and short reports, and do not leverage electronic healthrecord (EHR) data for supervision. We introduce Merlin - a 3D VLM that we trainusing paired CT scans (6+ million images from 15,331 CTs), EHR diagnosis codes(1.8+ million codes), and radiology reports (6+ million tokens). We evaluateMerlin on 6 task types and 752 individual tasks. The non-adapted(off-the-shelf) tasks include zero-shot findings classification (31 findings),phenotype classification (692 phenotypes), and zero-shot cross-modal retrieval(image to findings and image to impressions), while model adapted tasks include5-year disease prediction (6 diseases), radiology report generation, and 3Dsemantic segmentation (20 organs). We perform internal validation on a test setof 5,137 CTs, and external validation on 7,000 clinical CTs and on two publicCT datasets (VerSe, TotalSegmentator). Beyond these clinically-relevantevaluations, we assess the efficacy of various network architectures andtraining strategies to depict that Merlin has favorable performance to existingtask-specific baselines. We derive data scaling laws to empirically assesstraining data needs for requisite downstream task performance. Furthermore,unlike conventional VLMs that require hundreds of GPUs for training, we performall training on a single GPU.</description><author>Louis Blankemeier, Joseph Paul Cohen, Ashwin Kumar, Dave Van Veen, Syed Jamal Safdar Gardezi, Magdalini Paschali, Zhihong Chen, Jean-Benoit Delbrouck, Eduardo Reis, Cesar Truyts, Christian Bluethgen, Malte Engmann Kjeldskov Jensen, Sophie Ostmeier, Maya Varma, Jeya Maria Jose Valanarasu, Zhongnan Fang, Zepeng Huo, Zaid Nabulsi, Diego Ardila, Wei-Hung Weng, Edson Amaro Junior, Neera Ahuja, Jason Fries, Nigam H.

However, previous studies mainly fine-tune LLMs on biomedicaldatasets with limited diversity, which often rely on benchmarks or narrow taskscopes, and hence significantly limit the effectiveness on their medicalinstruction-following ability and generalizability. To bridge this gap, wepropose creating a diverse, machine-generated medical IFT dataset,MedInstruct-52k, using GPT-4 and ChatGPT with a high-quality expert-curatedseed set. We then fine-tune LLaMA-series models on the dataset to developAlpaCare. Despite using a smaller domain-specific dataset than previous medicalLLMs, AlpaCare not only demonstrates superior performance on medicalapplications, with up to 38.1% absolute gain over best baselines in medicalfree-form instruction evaluations, but also achieves 6.7% absolute gainsaveraged over multiple general domain benchmarks. Human evaluation furthershows that AlpaCare consistently outperforms best baselines in terms of bothcorrectness and helpfulness.

Whileexisting model editing techniques have shown promise, they are usuallyevaluated using metrics for reliability, specificity and generalization overone or few edits. We argue that for model editing to have practical utility, wemust be able to make multiple edits to the same model. With this in mind, weevaluate the current model editing methods at scale, focusing on two state ofthe art methods: ROME and MEMIT. We find that as the model is editedsequentially with multiple facts, it continually forgets previously editedfacts and the ability to perform downstream tasks. This forgetting happens intwo phases -- an initial gradual but progressive forgetting phase followed byabrupt or catastrophic forgetting phase. Both gradual and catastrophicforgetting limit the usefulness of model editing methods at scale -- the formermaking model editing less effective as multiple edits are made to the modelwhile the latter caps the scalability of such model editing methods. Ouranalysis also highlights other key limitations of ROME and MEMIT at scale. Withour work, we push for the development and evaluation of model editing methodskeeping scalability in mind.</description><author>Akshat Gupta, Anurag Rao, Gopala Anumanchipalli</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 18:50:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07453v4</guid></item><item><title>Robust Distribution Learning with Local and Global Adversarial Corruptions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06509v1</link><description>We consider learning in an adversarial environment, where an$\varepsilon$-fraction of samples from a distribution $P$ are arbitrarilymodified (*global* corruptions) and the remaining perturbations have averagemagnitude bounded by $\rho$ (*local* corruptions). Given access to $n$ suchcorrupted samples, we seek a computationally efficient estimator $\hat{P}_n$that minimizes the Wasserstein distance $\mathsf{W}_1(\hat{P}_n,P)$. In fact,we attack the fine-grained task of minimizing $\mathsf{W}_1(\Pi_\# \hat{P}_n,\Pi_\# P)$ for all orthogonal projections $\Pi \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$,with performance scaling with $\mathrm{rank}(\Pi) = k$. This allows us toaccount simultaneously for mean estimation ($k=1$), distribution estimation($k=d$), as well as the settings interpolating between these two extremes. Wecharacterize the optimal population-limit risk for this task and then developan efficient finite-sample algorithm with error bounded by $\sqrt{\varepsilonk} + \rho + d^{O(1)}\tilde{O}(n^{-1/k})$ when $P$ has bounded moments of order$2+\delta$, for constant $\delta &gt; 0$. For data distributions with boundedcovariance, our finite-sample bounds match the minimax population-level optimumfor large sample sizes.

Existing diffusion-based motion editing methods overlook theprofound potential of the prior embedded within the weights of pre-trainedmodels, which enables manipulating the latent feature space; hence, theyprimarily center on handling the motion space. In this work, we explore theattention mechanism of pre-trained motion diffusion models. We uncover theroles and interactions of attention elements in capturing and representingintricate human motion patterns, and carefully integrate these elements totransfer a leader motion to a follower one while maintaining the nuancedcharacteristics of the follower, resulting in zero-shot motion transfer.Editing features associated with selected motions allows us to confront achallenge observed in prior motion diffusion approaches, which use generaldirectives (e.g., text, music) for editing, ultimately failing to convey subtlenuances effectively. Our work is inspired by how a monkey closely imitates whatit sees while maintaining its unique motion patterns; hence we call it MonkeySee, Monkey Do, and dub it MoMo. Employing our technique enables accomplishingtasks such as synthesizing out-of-distribution motions, style transfer, andspatial editing. Furthermore, diffusion inversion is seldom employed formotions; as a result, editing efforts focus on generated motions, limiting theeditability of real ones. MoMo harnesses motion inversion, extending itsapplication to both real and generated motions. Experimental results show theadvantage of our approach over the current art. In particular, unlike methodstailored for specific applications through training, our approach is applied atinference time, requiring no training.

However, despite theirsuccesses, DRL-based policies suffer from poor reliability, which limits theirdeployment in safety-critical domains. As a result, various methods have beenput forth to address this issue by providing formal safety guarantees. Two mainapproaches include shielding and verification. While shielding ensures the safebehavior of the policy by employing an external online component (i.e., a``shield'') that overruns potentially dangerous actions, this approach has asignificant computational cost as the shield must be invoked at runtime tovalidate every decision. On the other hand, verification is an offline processthat can identify policies that are unsafe, prior to their deployment, yet,without providing alternative actions when such a policy is deemed unsafe. Inthis work, we present verification-guided shielding -- a novel approach thatbridges the DRL reliability gap by integrating these two methods. Our approachcombines both formal and probabilistic verification tools to partition theinput domain into safe and unsafe regions. In addition, we employ clusteringand symbolic representation procedures that compress the unsafe regions into acompact representation. This, in turn, allows to temporarily activate theshield solely in (potentially) unsafe regions, in an efficient manner.

Although equivariant architectures havebeen studied extensively, much less is known about the training dynamics ofequivariant neural networks. Concurrently, neural tangent kernels (NTKs) haveemerged as a powerful tool to analytically understand the training dynamics ofwide neural networks. In this work, we combine these two fields for the firsttime by giving explicit expressions for NTKs of group convolutional neuralnetworks.

We present an approach, inspired by recent advances in representationengineering, that interrupts the models as they respond with harmful outputswith "circuit breakers." Existing techniques aimed at improving alignment, suchas refusal training, are often bypassed. Techniques such as adversarialtraining try to plug these holes by countering specific attacks. As analternative to refusal training and adversarial training, circuit-breakingdirectly controls the representations that are responsible for harmful outputsin the first place. Our technique can be applied to both text-only andmultimodal language models to prevent the generation of harmful outputs withoutsacrificing utility -- even in the presence of powerful unseen attacks.Notably, while adversarial robustness in standalone image recognition remainsan open challenge, circuit breakers allow the larger multimodal system toreliably withstand image "hijacks" that aim to produce harmful content.Finally, we extend our approach to AI agents, demonstrating considerablereductions in the rate of harmful actions when they are under attack.

While Proximal PolicyOptimization (PPO) and related algorithms such as Actor-Critic with ExperienceReplay (ACER), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), and Deep DeterministicPolicy Gradient (DDPG) perform well in single-agent, stationary environments,they suffer from high variance in MARL due to non-stationary and hiddenpolicies of opponents, leading to diminished reward performance. Additionally,existing methods in MARL face significant challenges, including the need forinter-agent communication, reliance on explicit reward information, highcomputational demands, and sampling inefficiencies. These issues render themless effective in continuous environments where opponents may abruptly changetheir policies without prior notice. Against this background, we presentOPS-DeMo (Online Policy Switch-Detection Model), an online algorithm thatemploys dynamic error decay to detect changes in opponents' policies. OPS-DeMocontinuously updates its beliefs using an Assumed Opponent Policy (AOP) Bankand selects corresponding responses from a pre-trained Response Policy Bank.Each response policy is trained against consistently strategizing opponents,reducing training uncertainty and enabling the effective use of algorithms likePPO in multi-agent environments.

Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) is a promisingapproach that learns reward functions from human preferences. This enables RLagents to adapt their behavior based on human desires. However, humans live ina world full of diverse information, most of which is not relevant tocompleting a particular task. It becomes essential that agents learn to focuson the subset of task-relevant environment features. Unfortunately, prior workhas largely ignored this aspect; primarily focusing on improving PbRLalgorithms in standard RL environments that are carefully constructed tocontain only task-relevant features. This can result in algorithms that may noteffectively transfer to a more noisy real-world setting. To that end, this workproposes R2N (Robust-to-Noise), the first PbRL algorithm that leveragesprinciples of dynamic sparse training to learn robust reward models that canfocus on task-relevant features. We study the effectiveness of R2N in theExtremely Noisy Environment setting, an RL problem setting where up to 95% ofthe state features are irrelevant distractions. In experiments with a simulatedteacher, we demonstrate that R2N can adapt the sparse connectivity of itsneural networks to focus on task-relevant features, enabling R2N tosignificantly outperform several state-of-the-art PbRL algorithms in multiplelocomotion and control environments.</description><author>Calarina Muslimani, Bram Grooten, Deepak Ranganatha Sastry Mamillapalli, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Decebal Constantin Mocanu, Matthew E.

They are tractableif LVs can be analytically integrated out, otherwise they can be approximatedby tractable probabilistic circuits (PC) encoding a hierarchical numericalquadrature process, called QPCs.

We conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the usefulness ofmulticalibration post-processing across a broad set of tabular, image, andlanguage datasets for models spanning from simple decision trees to 90 millionparameter fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (1)models which are calibrated out of the box tend to be relativelymulticalibrated without any additional post-processing; (2) multicalibrationpost-processing can help inherently uncalibrated models; and (3) traditionalcalibration measures may sometimes provide multicalibration implicitly.

Their success in modeling nonlocal, long-rangecorrelations has led to their widespread adoption in natural languageprocessing, computer vision, and time-series problems. Neural operators, whichmap spaces of functions into spaces of functions, are necessarily bothnonlinear and nonlocal if they are universal; it is thus natural to ask whetherthe attention mechanism can be used in the design of neural operators.Motivated by this, we study transformers in the function space setting. Weformulate attention as a map between infinite dimensional function spaces andprove that the attention mechanism as implemented in practice is a Monte Carloor finite difference approximation of this operator. The function spaceformulation allows for the design of transformer neural operators, a class ofarchitectures designed to learn mappings between function spaces, for which weprove a universal approximation result. The prohibitive cost of applying theattention operator to functions defined on multi-dimensional domains leads tothe need for more efficient attention-based architectures. For this reason wealso introduce a function space generalization of the patching strategy fromcomputer vision, and introduce a class of associated neural operators.Numerical results, on an array of operator learning problems, demonstrate thepromise of our approaches to function space formulations of attention and theiruse in neural operators.</description><author>Edoardo Calvello, Nikola B.

However, these models stillunderperform transformers especially on tasks that require in-contextretrieval. While more expressive variants of linear transformers which replacethe additive outer-product update in linear transformers with the delta rulehave been found to be more effective at associative recall, existing algorithmsfor training such models do not parallelize over sequence length and are thusinefficient to train on modern hardware. This work describes ahardware-efficient algorithm for training linear transformers with the deltarule, which exploits a memory-efficient representation for computing productsof Householder matrices. This algorithm allows us to scale up DeltaNet tostandard language modeling settings.

Althoughattention-based models have shown effectiveness in this field, they oftenstruggle with inference inefficiency due to the quadratic computationalcomplexity inherent in attention mechanisms, especially with long-rangebehavior sequences. Drawing inspiration from the recent advancements of statespace models (SSMs) in control theory, which provide a robust framework formodeling and controlling dynamic systems, we introduce EchoMamba4Rec. Controltheory emphasizes the use of SSMs for managing long-range dependencies andmaintaining inferential efficiency through structured state matrices.EchoMamba4Rec leverages these control relationships in sequentialrecommendation and integrates bi-directional processing with frequency-domainfiltering to capture complex patterns and dependencies in user interaction datamore effectively. Our model benefits from the ability of state space models(SSMs) to learn and perform parallel computations, significantly enhancingcomputational efficiency and scalability. It features a bi-directional Mambamodule that incorporates both forward and reverse Mamba components, leveraginginformation from both past and future interactions. Additionally, a filterlayer operates in the frequency domain using learnable Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) and learnable filters, followed by an inverse FFT to refine itemembeddings and reduce noise. We also integrate Gate Linear Units (GLU) todynamically control information flow, enhancing the model's expressiveness andtraining stability.

While such neuromorphic approaches have beenproposed and realised for a wide range of platforms, physically extracting thegradients required for training remains challenging as generic approaches onlyexist in certain cases. Equilibrium propagation (EP) is such a procedure thathas been introduced and applied to classical energy-based models which relax toan equilibrium. Here, we show a direct connection between EP and Onsagerreciprocity and exploit this to derive a quantum version of EP. This can beused to optimize loss functions that depend on the expectation values ofobservables of an arbitrary quantum system. Specifically, we illustrate thisnew concept with supervised and unsupervised learning examples in which theinput or the solvable task is of quantum mechanical nature, e.g., therecognition of quantum many-body ground states, quantum phase exploration,sensing and phase boundary exploration. We propose that in the future quantumEP may be used to solve tasks such as quantum phase discovery with a quantumsimulator even for Hamiltonians which are numerically hard to simulate or evenpartially unknown.

It has been observed that DNNsare particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse ofdimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s todescribe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the samplecomplexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximationproblem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs havebeen used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning theirmathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability,accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In thispaper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation usingsparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze anefficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL.

In this paper, we propose the BTDT-MBO algorithm, incorporatingMerriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) techniques and a bidirectional transformer, as wellas distance correlation and decision threshold adjustments, for dataclassification problems on highly imbalanced molecular data sets, where thesizes of the classes vary greatly. The proposed method not only integratesadjustments in the classification threshold for the MBO algorithm in order tohelp deal with the class imbalance, but also uses a bidirectional transformermodel based on an attention mechanism for self-supervised learning.Additionally, the method implements distance correlation as a weight functionfor the similarity graph-based framework on which the adjusted MBO algorithmoperates. The proposed model is validated using six molecular data sets, and wealso provide a thorough comparison to other competing algorithms. Thecomputational experiments show that the proposed method performs better thancompeting techniques even when the class imbalance ratio is very high.</description><author>Nicole Hayes, Ekaterina Merkurjev, Guo-Wei Wei</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 18:20:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06479v1</guid></item><item><title>Training Dynamics of Multi-Head Softmax Attention for In-Context Learning: Emergence, Convergence, and Optimality</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19442v2</link><description>We study the dynamics of gradient flow for training a multi-head softmaxattention model for in-context learning of multi-task linear regression. Weestablish the global convergence of gradient flow under suitable choices ofinitialization. In addition, we prove that an interesting "task allocation"phenomenon emerges during the gradient flow dynamics, where each attention headfocuses on solving a single task of the multi-task model. Specifically, weprove that the gradient flow dynamics can be split into three phases -- awarm-up phase where the loss decreases rather slowly and the attention headsgradually build up their inclination towards individual tasks, an emergencephase where each head selects a single task and the loss rapidly decreases, anda convergence phase where the attention parameters converge to a limit.Furthermore, we prove the optimality of gradient flow in the sense that thelimiting model learned by gradient flow is on par with the best possiblemulti-head softmax attention model up to a constant factor. Our analysis alsodelineates a strict separation in terms of the prediction accuracy of ICLbetween single-head and multi-head attention models. The key technique for ourconvergence analysis is to map the gradient flow dynamics in the parameterspace to a set of ordinary differential equations in the spectral domain, wherethe relative magnitudes of the semi-singular values of the attention weightsdetermines task allocation. To our best knowledge, our work provides the firstconvergence result for the multi-head softmax attention model.</description><author>Siyu Chen, Heejune Sheen, Tianhao Wang, Zhuoran Yang</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 18:18:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19442v2</guid></item><item><title>Survey for Landing Generative AI in Social and E-commerce Recsys -- the Industry Perspectives</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06475v1</link><description>Recently, generative AI (GAI), with their emerging capabilities, havepresented unique opportunities for augmenting and revolutionizing industrialrecommender systems (Recsys).

However, mobile and wearable devices, which are rarely integrated intosuch tasks, provide rich, longitudinal data for personal health monitoring.Here we present Personal Health Large Language Model (PH-LLM), fine-tuned fromGemini for understanding and reasoning over numerical time-series personalhealth data. We created and curated three datasets that test 1) production ofpersonalized insights and recommendations from sleep patterns, physicalactivity, and physiological responses, 2) expert domain knowledge, and 3)prediction of self-reported sleep outcomes. For the first task we designed 857case studies in collaboration with domain experts to assess real-worldscenarios in sleep and fitness. Through comprehensive evaluation ofdomain-specific rubrics, we observed that Gemini Ultra 1.0 and PH-LLM are notstatistically different from expert performance in fitness and, while expertsremain superior for sleep, fine-tuning PH-LLM provided significant improvementsin using relevant domain knowledge and personalizing information for sleepinsights. We evaluated PH-LLM domain knowledge using multiple choice sleepmedicine and fitness examinations. PH-LLM achieved 79% on sleep and 88% onfitness, exceeding average scores from a sample of human experts. Finally, wetrained PH-LLM to predict self-reported sleep quality outcomes from textual andmultimodal encoding representations of wearable data, and demonstrate thatmultimodal encoding is required to match performance of specializeddiscriminative models. Although further development and evaluation arenecessary in the safety-critical personal health domain, these resultsdemonstrate both the broad knowledge and capabilities of Gemini models and thebenefit of contextualizing physiological data for personal health applicationsas done with PH-LLM.</description><author>Justin Cosentino, Anastasiya Belyaeva, Xin Liu, Nicholas A.

This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitiveenvironments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games thatrequire pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents. We firstpropose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely recognizedtasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incompleteinformation, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministicscenarios. Then, we (1) Characterize the game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; and(2) Perform LLM-vs.-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation. We observe that(1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; forexample, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitivein probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Most open-source LLMs, e.g.,CodeLlama-34b-Instruct and Llama-2-70b-chat, are less competitive thancommercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games, yet the recently releasedLlama-3-70b-Instruct makes up for this shortcoming. In addition,code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoningmethods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not alwayshelp. We further characterize the game-theoretic properties of LLMs, such asequilibrium and Pareto Efficiency in repeated games. Detailed error profilesare provided for a better understanding of LLMs' behavior. We hope our researchprovides standardized protocols and serves as a foundation to spur furtherexplorations in the strategic reasoning of LLMs.</description><author>Jinhao Duan, Renming Zhang, James Diffenderfer, Bhavya Kailkhura, Lichao Sun, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal, Tianlong Chen, Kaidi Xu</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 18:14:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12348v2</guid></item><item><title>The fast committor machine: Interpretable prediction with kernels</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10410v2</link><description>In the study of stochastic systems, the committor function describes theprobability that a system starting from an initial configuration $x$ will reacha set $B$ before a set $A$. This paper introduces an efficient andinterpretable algorithm for approximating the committor, called the "fastcommittor machine" (FCM). The FCM uses simulated trajectory data to build akernel-based model of the committor. The kernel function is constructed toemphasize low-dimensional subspaces which optimally describe the $A$ to $B$transitions. The coefficients in the kernel model are determined usingrandomized linear algebra, leading to a runtime that scales linearly in thenumber of data points. In numerical experiments involving a triple-wellpotential and alanine dipeptide, the FCM yields higher accuracy and trains morequickly than a neural network with the same number of parameters.

By adopting theunique characteristics of KANs, notably the use of learnable univariatefunctions instead of fixed linear weights, we develop a powerful model forgraph-based learning tasks. Unlike traditional Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) that rely on a fixed convolutional architecture, GKANs implementlearnable spline-based functions between layers, transforming the wayinformation is processed across the graph structure. We present two differentways to incorporate KAN layers into GKAN: architecture 1 -- where the learnablefunctions are applied to input features after aggregation and architecture 2 --where the learnable functions are applied to input features before aggregation.We evaluate GKAN empirically using a semi-supervised graph learning task on areal-world dataset (Cora). We find that architecture generally performs better.We find that GKANs achieve higher accuracy in semi-supervised learning tasks ongraphs compared to the traditional GCN model. For example, when considering 100features, GCN provides an accuracy of 53.5 while a GKAN with a comparablenumber of parameters gives an accuracy of 61.76; with 200 features, GCNprovides an accuracy of 61.24 while a GKAN with a comparable number ofparameters gives an accuracy of 67.66.

We introduce Husky, a holistic, open-source language agent thatlearns to reason over a unified action space to address a diverse set ofcomplex tasks involving numerical, tabular, and knowledge-based reasoning.Husky iterates between two stages: 1) generating the next action to taketowards solving a given task and 2) executing the action using expert modelsand updating the current solution state. We identify a thorough ontology ofactions for addressing complex tasks and curate high-quality data to trainexpert models for executing these actions. Our experiments show that Huskyoutperforms prior language agents across 14 evaluation datasets. Moreover, weintroduce HuskyQA, a new evaluation set which stress tests language agents formixed-tool reasoning, with a focus on retrieving missing knowledge andperforming numerical reasoning.

Recently,Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) variants have shown promising results in active3D reconstruction using uncertainty-guided view selection. They utilizeuncertainties estimated with neural networks that encode scene geometry andappearance. However, the choice of uncertainty integration methods, eithervoxel-based or neural rendering, has conventionally depended on the types ofscene uncertainty being estimated, whether geometric or appearance-related. Inthis paper, we introduce Colorized Surface Voxel (CSV)-based view selection, anew next-best view (NBV) selection method exploiting surface voxel-basedmeasurement of uncertainty in scene appearance. CSV encapsulates theuncertainty of estimated scene appearance (e.g., color uncertainty) andestimated geometric information (e.g., surface). Using the geometryinformation, we interpret the uncertainty of scene appearance 3D-wise duringthe aggregation of the per-voxel uncertainty. Consequently, the uncertaintyfrom occluded and complex regions is recognized under challenging scenarioswith limited input data. Our method outperforms previous works on populardatasets, DTU and Blender, and our new dataset with imbalanced viewpoints,showing that the CSV-based view selection significantly improves performance byup to 30%.</description><author>Hyunseo Kim, Hyeonseo Yang, Taekyung Kim, YoonSung Kim, Jin-Hwa Kim, Byoung-Tak Zhang</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 18:05:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02568v2</guid></item><item><title>How Far Can Transformers Reason?

This paperputs forward the notion of 'distribution locality' to capture when weaklearning is efficiently achievable by regular Transformers, where the localitymeasures the least number of tokens required in addition to the tokenshistogram to correlate nontrivially with the target. As shown experimentallyand theoretically under additional assumptions, distributions with highlocality cannot be learned efficiently. In particular, syllogisms cannot becomposed on long chains. Furthermore, we show that (i) an agnostic scratchpadcannot help to break the locality barrier, (ii) an educated scratchpad can helpif it breaks the locality at each step, (iii) a notion of 'inductivescratchpad' can both break the locality and improve the out-of-distributiongeneralization, e.g., generalizing to almost double input size for somearithmetic tasks.</description><author>Emmanuel Abbe, Samy Bengio, Aryo Lotfi, Colin Sandon, Omid Saremi</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 18:05:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06467v1</guid></item><item><title>Explainable Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Accurate Fault Detection and Diagnosis: A Review</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11597v2</link><description>As the manufacturing industry advances with sensor integration andautomation, the opaque nature of deep learning models in machine learning posesa significant challenge for fault detection and diagnosis.

We observe thatpretrained Image2Video diffusion models possess good priors for video dynamicsbut they lack textual control.

This task stems from the observation that textembedded in images is intrinsically different from common visual elements andnatural language due to the need to align the modalities of vision, text, andtext embedded in images. While numerous works have integrated text embedded inimages into visual question-answering tasks, approaches to these tasksgenerally rely on optical character recognition or masked language modeling,thus reducing the task to mainly text-based processing. However, text-basedprocessing becomes ineffective in VCR as accurate text restoration depends onthe combined information from provided images, context, and subtle cues fromthe tiny exposed areas of masked texts. We develop a pipeline to generatesynthetic images for the VCR task using image-caption pairs, with adjustablecaption visibility to control the task difficulty. With this pipeline, weconstruct a dataset for VCR called VCR-Wiki using images with captions fromWikipedia, comprising 2.11M English and 346K Chinese entities in both easy andhard split variants.

However, scientists often have strongintuition, and thus human feedback is still useful. Nevertheless, prior worksin enhancing BO with expert feedback, such as by incorporating it in an offlineor online but blocking (arrives at each BO iteration) manner, are incompatiblewith the spirit of self-driving labs. In this work, we study whether a smallamount of randomly arriving expert feedback that is being incorporated in anon-blocking manner can improve a BO campaign. To this end, we run anadditional, independent computing thread on top of the BO loop to handle thefeedback-gathering process. The gathered feedback is used to learn a Bayesianpreference model that can readily be incorporated into the BO thread, to steerits exploration-exploitation process. Experiments on toy and chemistry datasetssuggest that even just a few intermittent, asynchronous expert feedback can beuseful for improving or constraining BO.

Furthermore, a confidence interval was formed from observational dataon the quality of treatment from human oncologists to estimate the proportionof scenarios in which the model must outperform the original oncologist in itstreatment prediction to be a better solution overall as 8.2% to 13.3%. Due toindeterminacy in the outcomes of cancer treatment decisions, futureinvestigation, potentially a clinical trial, would be required to determine ifthis threshold was met by the models. Nevertheless, with 85% of U.S. cancerpatients receiving treatment at local community facilities, these kinds ofmodels could play an important part in expanding access to quality care withoutcomes that lie, at minimum, close to a human oncologist.</description><author>Tristen Pool, Dennis Trujillo</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 17:44:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06455v1</guid></item><item><title>Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects by Combining Weak Instruments and Observational Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06452v1</link><description>Accurately predicting conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) iscrucial in personalized medicine and digital platform analytics. Since oftenthe treatments of interest cannot be directly randomized, observational data isleveraged to learn CATEs, but this approach can incur significant bias fromunobserved confounding. One strategy to overcome these limitations is to seeklatent quasi-experiments in instrumental variables (IVs) for the treatment, forexample, a randomized intent to treat or a randomized product recommendation.This approach, on the other hand, can suffer from low compliance, i.e., IVweakness. Some subgroups may even exhibit zero compliance meaning we cannotinstrument for their CATEs at all. In this paper we develop a novel approach tocombine IV and observational data to enable reliable CATE estimation in thepresence of unobserved confounding in the observational data and low compliancein the IV data, including no compliance for some subgroups. We propose atwo-stage framework that first learns biased CATEs from the observational data,and then applies a compliance-weighted correction using IV data, effectivelyleveraging IV strength variability across covariates. We characterize theconvergence rates of our method and validate its effectiveness through asimulation study. Additionally, we demonstrate its utility with real data byanalyzing the heterogeneous effects of 401(k) plan participation on wealth.</description><author>Miruna Oprescu, Nathan Kallus</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 17:40:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06452v1</guid></item><item><title>Insights from Social Shaping Theory: The Appropriation of Large Language Models in an Undergraduate Programming Course</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06451v1</link><description>The capability of large language models (LLMs) to generate, debug, andexplain code has sparked the interest of researchers and educators inundergraduate programming, with many anticipating their transformativepotential in programming education. However, decisions about why and how to useLLMs in programming education may involve more than just the assessment of anLLM's technical capabilities. Using the social shaping of technology theory asa guiding framework, our study explores how students' social perceptionsinfluence their own LLM usage. We then examine the correlation of self-reportedLLM usage with students' self-efficacy and midterm performances in anundergraduate programming course. Triangulating data from an anonymousend-of-course student survey (n = 158), a mid-course self-efficacy survey(n=158), student interviews (n = 10), self-reported LLM usage on homework, andmidterm performances, we discovered that students' use of LLMs was associatedwith their expectations for their future careers and their perceptions of peerusage. Additionally, early self-reported LLM usage in our context correlatedwith lower self-efficacy and lower midterm scores, while students' perceivedover-reliance on LLMs, rather than their usage itself, correlated withdecreased self-efficacy later in the course.</description><author>Aadarsh Padiyath, Xinying Hou, Amy Pang, Diego Viramontes Vargas, Xingjian Gu, Tamara Nelson-Fromm, Zihan Wu, Mark Guzdial, Barbara Ericson</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 17:40:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06451v1</guid></item><item><title>Cometh: A continuous-time discrete-state graph diffusion model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06449v1</link><description>Discrete-state denoising diffusion models led to state-of-the-art performancein graph generation, especially in the molecular domain.

Recent works have presented methods toidentify if individual text sequences were members of the model's trainingdata, known as membership inference attacks (MIAs). We demonstrate that theapparent success of these MIAs is confounded by selecting non-members (textsequences not used for training) belonging to a different distribution from themembers (e.g., temporally shifted recent Wikipedia articles compared with onesused to train the model). This distribution shift makes membership inferenceappear successful. However, most MIA methods perform no better than randomguessing when discriminating between members and non-members from the samedistribution (e.g., in this case, the same period of time). Even when MIAswork, we find that different MIAs succeed at inferring membership of samplesfrom different distributions. Instead, we propose a new dataset inferencemethod to accurately identify the datasets used to train large language models.This paradigm sits realistically in the modern-day copyright landscape, whereauthors claim that an LLM is trained over multiple documents (such as a book)written by them, rather than one particular paragraph. While dataset inferenceshares many of the challenges of membership inference, we solve it byselectively combining the MIAs that provide positive signal for a givendistribution, and aggregating them to perform a statistical test on a givendataset. Our approach successfully distinguishes the train and test sets ofdifferent subsets of the Pile with statistically significant p-values &lt; 0.1,without any false positives.</description><author>Pratyush Maini, Hengrui Jia, Nicolas Papernot, Adam Dziedzic</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 17:34:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06443v1</guid></item><item><title>Interpretability of Language Models via Task Spaces</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06441v1</link><description>The usual way to interpret language models (LMs) is to test their performanceon different benchmarks and subsequently infer their internal processes. Inthis paper, we present an alternative approach, concentrating on the quality ofLM processing, with a focus on their language abilities. To this end, weconstruct 'linguistic task spaces' -- representations of an LM's languageconceptualisation -- that shed light on the connections LMs draw betweenlanguage phenomena. Task spaces are based on the interactions of the learningsignals from different linguistic phenomena, which we assess via a method wecall 'similarity probing'. To disentangle the learning signals of linguisticphenomena, we further introduce a method called 'fine-tuning via gradientdifferentials' (FTGD). We apply our methods to language models of threedifferent scales and find that larger models generalise better to overarchinggeneral concepts for linguistic tasks, making better use of their sharedstructure. Further, the distributedness of linguistic processing increases withpre-training through increased parameter sharing between related linguistictasks. The overall generalisation patterns are mostly stable throughouttraining and not marked by incisive stages, potentially explaining the lack ofsuccessful curriculum strategies for LMs.</description><author>Lucas Weber, Jaap Jumelet, Elia Bruni, Dieuwke Hupkes</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 17:34:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06441v1</guid></item><item><title>Multimodal Contextualized Semantic Parsing from Speech</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06438v1</link><description>We introduce Semantic Parsing in Contextual Environments (SPICE), a taskdesigned to enhance artificial agents' contextual awareness by integratingmultimodal inputs with prior contexts.

Effective fault diagnosis and root cause analysis of the ITO electrodesare essential to ensure the performance and reliability of the devices.However, traditional visual inspection is challenging with transparent ITOelectrodes, and existing fault diagnosis methods have limitations indetermining the root causes of the defects, often requiring destructiveevaluations and secondary material characterization techniques. In this study,a fault diagnosis method with root cause analysis is proposed using scatteringparameter (S-parameter) patterns, offering early detection, high diagnosticaccuracy, and noise robustness. A comprehensive S-parameter pattern database isobtained according to various defect states of the ITO electrodes. Deeplearning (DL) approaches, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutionalneural network (CNN), and transformer, are then used to simultaneously analyzethe cause and severity of defects. Notably, it is demonstrated that thediagnostic performance under additive noise levels can be significantlyenhanced by combining different channels of the S-parameters as input to thelearning algorithms, as confirmed through the t-distributed stochastic neighborembedding (t-SNE) dimension reduction visualization of the S-parameterpatterns.</description><author>Tae Yeob Kang, Haebom Lee, Sungho Suh</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 17:29:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11639v2</guid></item><item><title>Self-explainable Graph Neural Network for Alzheimer's Disease And Related Dementias Risk Prediction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06584v4</link><description>Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) ranks as the sixth leadingcause of death in the US, underlining the importance of accurate ADRD riskprediction. While recent advancement in ADRD risk prediction have primarilyrelied on imaging analysis, yet not all patients undergo medical imaging beforean ADRD diagnosis. Merging machine learning with claims data can revealadditional risk factors and uncover interconnections among diverse medicalcodes. Objective: Our goal is to utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with claims data for ADRDrisk prediction. Addressing the lack of human-interpretable reasons behindthese predictions, we introduce an innovative method to evaluate relationshipimportance and its influence on ADRD risk prediction, ensuring comprehensiveinterpretation. Methods: We employed Variationally Regularized Encoder-decoder Graph Neural Network(VGNN) for estimating ADRD likelihood. We created three scenarios to assess themodel's efficiency, using Random Forest and Light Gradient Boost Machine asbaselines. We further used our relation importance method to clarify the keyrelationships for ADRD risk prediction. Results: VGNN surpassed other baseline models by 10% in the area under the receiveroperating characteristic. The integration of the GNN model and relationimportance interpretation could potentially play an essential role in providingvaluable insight into factors that may contribute to or delay ADRD progression. Conclusions: Employing a GNN approach with claims data enhances ADRD risk prediction andprovides insights into the impact of interconnected medical code relationships.This methodology not only enables ADRD risk modeling but also shows potentialfor other image analysis predictions using claims data.</description><author>Xinyue Hu, Zenan Sun, Yi Nian, Yichen Wang, Yifang Dang, Fang Li, Jingna Feng, Evan Yu, Cui Tao</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 17:29:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06584v4</guid></item><item><title>Adaptive Interface-PINNs (AdaI-PINNs): An Efficient Physics-informed Neural Networks Framework for Interface Problems</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04626v2</link><description>We present an efficient physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) framework,termed Adaptive Interface-PINNs (AdaI-PINNs), to improve the modeling ofinterface problems with discontinuous coefficients and/or interfacial jumps.This framework is an enhanced version of its predecessor, Interface PINNs orI-PINNs (Sarma et al.; https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4766623), which involvesdomain decomposition and assignment of different predefined activationfunctions to the neural networks in each subdomain across a sharp interface,while keeping all other parameters of the neural networks identical.

Here, we introduce DISCO, an end-to-end contextual banditframework for personalised discount code allocation at ASOS.com. DISCO adaptsthe traditional Thompson Sampling algorithm by integrating it within an integerprogram, thereby allowing for operational cost control. Because bandit learningis often worse with high dimensional actions, we focused on building lowdimensional action and context representations that were nonetheless capable ofgood accuracy. Additionally, we sought to build a model that preserved therelationship between price and sales, in which customers increasing theirpurchasing in response to lower prices ("negative price elasticity"). Theseaims were achieved by using radial basis functions to represent the continuous(i.e. infinite armed) action space, in combination with context embeddingsextracted from a neural network. These feature representations were used withina Thompson Sampling framework to facilitate exploration, and further integratedwith an integer program to allocate discount codes across ASOS's customer base.These modelling decisions result in a reward model that (a) enables pooledlearning across similar actions, (b) is highly accurate, including inextrapolation, and (c) preserves the expected negative price elasticity.Through offline analysis, we show that DISCO is able to effectively enactexploration and improves its performance over time, despite the globalconstraint.

However, this often limits the flexibility of modelsduring alignment, especially when there is a clear distributional discrepancybetween the preference data and the reference model. In this paper, we focus onthe alignment of recent text-to-image diffusion models, such as StableDiffusion XL (SDXL), and find that this "reference mismatch" is indeed asignificant problem in aligning these models due to the unstructured nature ofvisual modalities: e.g., a preference for a particular stylistic aspect caneasily induce such a discrepancy.

MaPO jointly maximizes the likelihood margin between thepreferred and dispreferred image sets and the likelihood of the preferred sets,simultaneously learning general stylistic features and preferences.

The empirical Fisher (EF)method approximates the Fisher information matrix empirically by reusing theper-sample gradients collected during back-propagation. Despite its ease ofimplementation, the EF approximation has its theoretical and practicallimitations. This paper first investigates the inversely-scaled projectionissue of EF, which is shown to be a major cause of the poor empiricalapproximation quality. An improved empirical Fisher (iEF) method, motivated asa generalised NGD method from a loss reduction perspective, is proposed toaddress this issue, meanwhile retaining the practical convenience of EF. Theexact iEF and EF methods are experimentally evaluated using practical deeplearning setups, including widely-used setups for parameter-efficientfine-tuning of pre-trained models (T5-base with LoRA and Prompt-Tuning on GLUEtasks, and ViT with LoRA for CIFAR100). Optimisation experiments show thatapplying exact iEF as an optimiser provides strong convergence andgeneralisation. It achieves the best test performance and the lowest trainingloss for majority of the tasks, even when compared with well-tunedAdamW/Adafactor baselines. Additionally, under a novel empirical evaluationframework, the proposed iEF method shows consistently better approximationquality to the exact Natural Gradient updates than both EF and the moreexpensive sampled Fisher (SF). Further investigation also shows that thesuperior approximation quality of iEF is robust to damping across tasks andtraining stages. Improving existing approximate NGD optimisers with iEF isexpected to lead to better convergence ability and stronger robustness tochoice of damping.</description><author>Xiaodong Wu, Wenyi Yu, Chao Zhang, Philip Woodland</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 17:12:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06420v1</guid></item><item><title>Foundation Inference Models for Markov Jump Processes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06419v1</link><description>Markov jump processes are continuous-time stochastic processes which describedynamical systems evolving in discrete state spaces.

In an attempt to tackle this, many GNN explanation methodshave emerged. Their goal is to explain a model's predictions and thereby obtaintrust when GNN models are deployed in decision critical applications. Most GNNexplanation methods work in a post-hoc manner and provide explanations in theform of a small subset of important edges and/or nodes. In this paper wedemonstrate that these explanations can unfortunately not be trusted, as commonGNN explanation methods turn out to be highly susceptible to adversarialperturbations. That is, even small perturbations of the original graphstructure that preserve the model's predictions may yield drastically differentexplanations. This calls into question the trustworthiness and practicalutility of post-hoc explanation methods for GNNs. To be able to attack GNNexplanation models, we devise a novel attack method dubbed \textit{GXAttack},the first \textit{optimization-based} adversarial attack method for post-hocGNN explanations under such settings. Due to the devastating effectiveness ofour attack, we call for an adversarial evaluation of future GNN explainers todemonstrate their robustness.</description><author>Zhong Li, Simon Geisler, Yuhang Wang, Stephan Günnemann, Matthijs van Leeuwen</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 17:09:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06417v1</guid></item><item><title>Reproducibility study of FairAC</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03314v2</link><description>This work aims to reproduce the findings of the paper "Fair AttributeCompletion on Graph with Missing Attributes" written by Guo, Chu, and LiarXiv:2302.12977 by investigating the claims made in the paper.

The aim of the research is to assess theimpact of multiple agents and illusion of humanness on the quality of theinteraction. The experiment investigates two styles of agent presentation: anagent of high human-likeness (HECA) and an agent of low human-likeness (text).The purpose of the experiment is to assess whether and how agents of highhumanlikeness can evoke the illusion of humanness and affect usability. Agentsof high human-likeness were designed by following the ECA design model that isa proposed guide for ECA development. The results of the experiment with 90participants show that users prefer to interact with the HECAs. The differencebetween the two versions is statistically significant with a large effect size(d=1.01), with many of the participants justifying their choice by saying thatthe human-like characteristics of the HECA made the version more appealing.This research provides key information on the potential effect of HECAs onserious games, which can provide insight into the design of future mobileserious games.</description><author>Danai Korre, Judy Robertson</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 17:08:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07773v3</guid></item><item><title>Differentially Private Best-Arm Identification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06408v1</link><description>Best Arm Identification (BAI) problems are progressively used fordata-sensitive applications, such as designing adaptive clinical trials, tuninghyper-parameters, and conducting user studies. Motivated by the data privacyconcerns invoked by these applications, we study the problem of BAI with fixedconfidence in both the local and central models, i.e. $\epsilon$-local and$\epsilon$-global Differential Privacy (DP). First, to quantify the cost ofprivacy, we derive lower bounds on the sample complexity of any$\delta$-correct BAI algorithm satisfying $\epsilon$-global DP or$\epsilon$-local DP. Our lower bounds suggest the existence of two privacyregimes. In the high-privacy regime, the hardness depends on a coupled effectof privacy and novel information-theoretic quantities involving the TotalVariation. In the low-privacy regime, the lower bounds reduce to thenon-private lower bounds. We propose $\epsilon$-local DP and $\epsilon$-globalDP variants of a Top Two algorithm, namely CTB-TT and AdaP-TT*, respectively.For $\epsilon$-local DP, CTB-TT is asymptotically optimal by plugging in aprivate estimator of the means based on Randomised Response. For$\epsilon$-global DP, our private estimator of the mean runs in arm-dependentadaptive episodes and adds Laplace noise to ensure a good privacy-utilitytrade-off. By adapting the transportation costs, the expected sample complexityof AdaP-TT* reaches the asymptotic lower bound up to multiplicative constants.</description><author>Achraf Azize, Marc Jourdan, Aymen Al Marjani, Debabrota Basu</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 17:02:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06408v1</guid></item><item><title>The Structure and Dynamics of Knowledge Graphs, with Superficiality</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08116v4</link><description>Large knowledge graphs combine human knowledge garnered from projects rangingfrom academia and institutions to enterprises and crowdsourcing.

This research is set outto identify ethical considerations that arise in the design and development ofthese two technologies in combination. Using LLMs for social robotics mayprovide benefits, such as enabling natural language open-domain dialogues.However, the intersection of these two technologies also gives rise to ethicalconcerns related to misinformation, non-verbal cues, emotional disruption, andbiases. The robot's physical social embodiment adds complexity, as ethicalhazards associated with LLM-based Social AI, such as hallucinations andmisinformation, can be exacerbated due to the effects of physical embodiment onsocial perception and communication. To address these challenges, this studyemploys an empirical design justice-based methodology, focusing on identifyingsocio-technical ethical considerations through a qualitative co-design andinteraction study. The purpose of the study is to identify ethicalconsiderations relevant to the process of co-design of, and interaction with ahumanoid social robot as the interface of a LLM, and to evaluate how a designjustice methodology can be used in the context of designing LLMs-based socialrobotics.

Several techniques have beenproposed in the literature for different dialogue types (e.g., Open-Domain).However, the evaluations of these techniques have been limited in terms of baseLLMs, dialogue types and evaluation metrics. In this work, we extensivelyanalyze different LLM adaptation techniques when applied to different dialoguetypes. We have selected two base LLMs, Llama-2 and Mistral, and four dialoguetypes Open-Domain, Knowledge-Grounded, Task-Oriented, and Question Answering.We evaluate the performance of in-context learning and fine-tuning techniquesacross datasets selected for each dialogue type. We assess the impact ofincorporating external knowledge to ground the generation in both scenarios ofRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and gold knowledge. We adopt consistentevaluation and explainability criteria for automatic metrics and humanevaluation protocols. Our analysis shows that there is no universalbest-technique for adapting large language models as the efficacy of eachtechnique depends on both the base LLM and the specific type of dialogue. Lastbut not least, the assessment of the best adaptation technique should includehuman evaluation to avoid false expectations and outcomes derived fromautomatic metrics.</description><author>Simone Alghisi, Massimo Rizzoli, Gabriel Roccabruna, Seyed Mahed Mousavi, Giuseppe Riccardi</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 16:52:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06399v1</guid></item><item><title>Lessons from Generalization Error Analysis of Federated Learning: You May Communicate Less Often!</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05862v2</link><description>We investigate the generalization error of statistical learning models in aFederated Learning (FL) setting. Specifically, we study the evolution of thegeneralization error with the number of communication rounds $R$ between $K$clients and a parameter server (PS), i.e., the effect on the generalizationerror of how often the clients' local models are aggregated at PS. In oursetup, the more the clients communicate with PS the less data they use forlocal training in each round, such that the amount of training data per clientis identical for distinct values of $R$. We establish PAC-Bayes andrate-distortion theoretic bounds on the generalization error that accountexplicitly for the effect of the number of rounds $R$, in addition to thenumber of participating devices $K$ and individual datasets size $n$. Thebounds, which apply to a large class of loss functions and learning algorithms,appear to be the first of their kind for the FL setting. Furthermore, we applyour bounds to FL-type Support Vector Machines (FSVM); and derive (more)explicit bounds in this case. In particular, we show that the generalizationbound of FSVM increases with $R$, suggesting that more frequent communicationwith PS diminishes the generalization power. This implies that the populationrisk decreases less fast with $R$ than does the empirical risk. Moreover, ourbound suggests that the generalization error of FSVM decreases faster than thatof centralized learning by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log(K)/K})$.Finally, we provide experimental results obtained using neural networks(ResNet-56) which show evidence that not only may our observations for FSVMhold more generally but also that the population risk may even start toincrease beyond some value of $R$.</description><author>Milad Sefidgaran, Romain Chor, Abdellatif Zaidi, Yijun Wan</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 16:52:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05862v2</guid></item><item><title>RAID: A Shared Benchmark for Robust Evaluation of Machine-Generated Text Detectors</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07940v2</link><description>Many commercial and open-source models claim to detect machine-generated textwith extremely high accuracy (99% or more).

Traditional training methods, relying onstatic datasets, are increasingly inadequate for coping with the dynamic natureof real-world information. Lifelong learning, also known as continual orincremental learning, addresses this challenge by enabling LLMs to learncontinuously and adaptively over their operational lifetime, integrating newknowledge while retaining previously learned information and preventingcatastrophic forgetting. This survey delves into the sophisticated landscape oflifelong learning, categorizing strategies into two primary groups: InternalKnowledge and External Knowledge. Internal Knowledge includes continualpretraining and continual finetuning, each enhancing the adaptability of LLMsin various scenarios. External Knowledge encompasses retrieval-based andtool-based lifelong learning, leveraging external data sources andcomputational tools to extend the model's capabilities without modifying coreparameters. The key contributions of our survey are: (1) Introducing a noveltaxonomy categorizing the extensive literature of lifelong learning into 12scenarios; (2) Identifying common techniques across all lifelong learningscenarios and classifying existing literature into various technique groupswithin each scenario; (3) Highlighting emerging techniques such as modelexpansion and data selection, which were less explored in the pre-LLM era.Through a detailed examination of these groups and their respective categories,this survey aims to enhance the adaptability, reliability, and overallperformance of LLMs in real-world applications.</description><author>Junhao Zheng, Shengjie Qiu, Chengming Shi, Qianli Ma</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 16:46:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06391v1</guid></item><item><title>FPN-IAIA-BL: A Multi-Scale Interpretable Deep Learning Model for Classification of Mass Margins in Digital Mammography</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06386v1</link><description>Digital mammography is essential to breast cancer detection, and deeplearning offers promising tools for faster and more accurate mammogramanalysis.

Quantization is one of the most effective ways to make them morecompute and memory efficient. Quantization-aware training (QAT) methods,generally produce the best quantized performance, however it comes at the costof potentially long training time and excessive memory usage, making itimpractical when applying for LLMs. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning(PEFT) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) literature, we propose LR-QAT -- alightweight and memory-efficient QAT algorithm for LLMs. LR-QAT employs severalcomponents to save memory without sacrificing predictive performance: (a)low-rank auxiliary weights that are aware of the quantization grid; (b) adowncasting operator using fixed-point or double-packed integers and (c)checkpointing. Unlike most related work, our method (i) is inference-efficient,leading to no additional overhead compared to traditional PTQ; (ii) can be seenas a general extended pretraining framework, meaning that the resulting modelcan still be utilized for any downstream task afterwards; (iii) can be appliedacross a wide range of quantization settings, such as different choicesquantization granularity, activation quantization, and seamlessly combined withmany PTQ techniques. We apply LR-QAT to the LLaMA-2/3 and Mistral modelfamilies and validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. Our methodoutperforms common post-training quantization (PTQ) approaches and reaches thesame model performance as full-model QAT at the fraction of its memory usage.Specifically, we can train a 7B LLM on a single consumer grade GPU with 24GB ofmemory.</description><author>Yelysei Bondarenko, Riccardo Del Chiaro, Markus Nagel</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 16:44:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06385v1</guid></item><item><title>Generalizing to Unseen Domains in Diabetic Retinopathy with Disentangled Representations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06384v1</link><description>Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), induced by diabetes, poses a significant risk ofvisual impairment. Accurate and effective grading of DR aids in the treatmentof this condition. Yet existing models experience notable performancedegradation on unseen domains due to domain shifts. Previous methods addressthis issue by simulating domain style through simple visual transformation andmitigating domain noise via learning robust representations. However, domainshifts encompass more than image styles. They overlook biases caused byimplicit factors such as ethnicity, age, and diagnostic criteria. In our work,we propose a novel framework where representations of paired data fromdifferent domains are decoupled into semantic features and domain noise. Theresulting augmented representation comprises original retinal semantics anddomain noise from other domains, aiming to generate enhanced representationsaligned with real-world clinical needs, incorporating rich information fromdiverse domains. Subsequently, to improve the robustness of the decoupledrepresentations, class and domain prototypes are employed to interpolate thedisentangled representations while data-aware weights are designed to focus onrare classes and domains. Finally, we devise a robust pixel-level semanticalignment loss to align retinal semantics decoupled from features, maintaininga balance between intra-class diversity and dense class features.

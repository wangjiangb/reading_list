To reason about and tackle theselimitations, we make the key observation that planar diffuse surfaces behavespecularly at wavelengths used in the computational wave-based NLOS imagingdomain. We call such surfaces virtual mirrors. We leverage this observation toexpand the capabilities of NLOS imaging using illumination beyond the thirdbounce, addressing two problems: imaging single-corner objects at limitedvisibility angles, and imaging objects hidden behind two corners. To imageobjects at limited visibility angles, we first analyze the reflections of theknown illuminated point on surfaces of the scene as an estimator of theposition and orientation of objects with limited visibility. We then imagethose limited visibility objects by computationally building secondaryapertures at other surfaces that observe the target object from a directvisibility perspective. Beyond single-corner NLOS imaging, we exploit thespecular behavior of virtual mirrors to image objects hidden behind a secondcorner by imaging the space behind such virtual mirrors, where the mirror imageof objects hidden around two corners is formed. No specular surfaces wereinvolved in the making of this paper.</description><author>Diego Royo, Talha Sultan, Adolfo Mu√±oz, Khadijeh Masumnia-Bisheh, Eric Brandt, Diego Gutierrez, Andreas Velten, Julio Marco</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 18:59:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14341v1</guid></item><item><title>TabR: Unlocking the Power of Retrieval-Augmented Tabular Deep Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14338v1</link><description>Deep learning (DL) models for tabular data problems are receivingincreasingly more attention, while the algorithms based on gradient-boosteddecision trees (GBDT) remain a strong go-to solution. Following the recenttrends in other domains, such as natural language processing and computervision, several retrieval-augmented tabular DL models have been recentlyproposed. For a given target object, a retrieval-based model retrieves otherrelevant objects, such as the nearest neighbors, from the available (training)data and uses their features or even labels to make a better prediction.However, we show that the existing retrieval-based tabular DL solutions provideonly minor, if any, benefits over the properly tuned simple retrieval-freebaselines. Thus, it remains unclear whether the retrieval-based approach is aworthy direction for tabular DL. In this work, we give a strong positive answer to this question. We start byincrementally augmenting a simple feed-forward architecture with anattention-like retrieval component similar to those of many (tabular)retrieval-based models. Then, we highlight several details of the attentionmechanism that turn out to have a massive impact on the performance on tabulardata problems, but that were not explored in prior work. As a result, we designTabR -- a simple retrieval-based tabular DL model which, on a set of publicbenchmarks, demonstrates the best average performance among tabular DL models,becomes the new state-of-the-art on several datasets, and even outperforms GBDTmodels on the recently proposed ``GBDT-friendly'' benchmark (see the firstfigure).</description><author>Yury Gorishniy, Ivan Rubachev, Nikolay Kartashev, Daniil Shlenskii, Akim Kotelnikov, Artem Babenko</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 18:58:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14338v1</guid></item><item><title>MAMo: Leveraging Memory and Attention for Monocular Video Depth Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14336v1</link><description>We propose MAMo, a novel memory and attention frame-work for monocular videodepth estimation. MAMo can augment and improve any single-image depthestimation networks into video depth estimation models, enabling them to takeadvantage of the temporal information to predict more accurate depth. In MAMo,we augment model with memory which aids the depth prediction as the modelstreams through the video. Specifically, the memory stores learned visual anddisplacement tokens of the previous time instances. This allows the depthnetwork to cross-reference relevant features from the past when predictingdepth on the current frame. We introduce a novel scheme to continuously updatethe memory, optimizing it to keep tokens that correspond with both the past andthe present visual information. We adopt attention-based approach to processmemory features where we first learn the spatio-temporal relation among theresultant visual and displacement memory tokens using self-attention module.Further, the output features of self-attention are aggregated with the currentvisual features through cross-attention. The cross-attended features arefinally given to a decoder to predict depth on the current frame. Throughextensive experiments on several benchmarks, including KITTI, NYU-Depth V2, andDDAD, we show that MAMo consistently improves monocular depth estimationnetworks and sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy. Notably, our MAMo videodepth estimation provides higher accuracy with lower latency, when omparing toSOTA cost-volume-based video depth models.</description><author>Rajeev Yasarla, Hong Cai, Jisoo Jeong, Yunxiao Shi, Risheek Garrepalli, Fatih Porikli</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 18:55:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14336v1</guid></item><item><title>WavJourney: Compositional Audio Creation with Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14335v1</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in integrating diverseexpert models to tackle intricate language and vision tasks. Despite theirsignificance in advancing the field of Artificial Intelligence GeneratedContent (AIGC), their potential in intelligent audio content creation remainsunexplored. In this work, we tackle the problem of creating audio content withstorylines encompassing speech, music, and sound effects, guided by textinstructions. We present WavJourney, a system that leverages LLMs to connectvarious audio models for audio content generation. Given a text description ofan auditory scene, WavJourney first prompts LLMs to generate a structuredscript dedicated to audio storytelling. The audio script incorporates diverseaudio elements, organized based on their spatio-temporal relationships. As aconceptual representation of audio, the audio script provides an interactiveand interpretable rationale for human engagement. Afterward, the audio scriptis fed into a script compiler, converting it into a computer program. Each lineof the program calls a task-specific audio generation model or computationaloperation function (e.g., concatenate, mix). The computer program is thenexecuted to obtain an explainable solution for audio generation. We demonstratethe practicality of WavJourney across diverse real-world scenarios, includingscience fiction, education, and radio play. The explainable and interactivedesign of WavJourney fosters human-machine co-creation in multi-rounddialogues, enhancing creative control and adaptability in audio production.WavJourney audiolizes the human imagination, opening up new avenues forcreativity in multimedia content creation.</description><author>Xubo Liu, Zhongkai Zhu, Haohe Liu, Yi Yuan, Meng Cui, Qiushi Huang, Jinhua Liang, Yin Cao, Qiuqiang Kong, Mark D.

Generalist biomedical artificial intelligence (AI)systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale canpotentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery tocare delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curateMultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography anddermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation andsummarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLMMultimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AIsystem. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodesand interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, andgenomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performancecompetitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks,often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples ofzero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transferlearning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To furtherprobe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologistevaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observeencouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference forMed-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% ofcases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is neededto validate these models in real-world use cases, our results represent amilestone towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.</description><author>Tao Tu, Shekoofeh Azizi, Danny Driess, Mike Schaekermann, Mohamed Amin, Pi-Chuan Chang, Andrew Carroll, Chuck Lau, Ryutaro Tanno, Ira Ktena, Basil Mustafa, Aakanksha Chowdhery, Yun Liu, Simon Kornblith, David Fleet, Philip Mansfield, Sushant Prakash, Renee Wong, Sunny Virmani, Christopher Semturs, S Sara Mahdavi, Bradley Green, Ewa Dominowska, Blaise Aguera y Arcas, Joelle Barral, Dale Webster, Greg S.

These sensorsoffer many advantages including very high temporal resolution, no motion blurand smart data compression ideal for real-time processing. In this study, weintroduce an event-based dataset on fine-grained manipulation actions andperform an experimental study on the use of transformers for action predictionwith events. There is enormous interest in the fields of cognitive robotics andhuman-robot interaction on understanding and predicting human actions as earlyas possible. Early prediction allows anticipating complex stages for planning,enabling effective and real-time interaction. Our Transformer network usesevents to predict manipulation actions as they occur, using online inference.The model succeeds at predicting actions early on, building up confidence overtime and achieving state-of-the-art classification. Moreover, theattention-based transformer architecture allows us to study the role of thespatio-temporal patterns selected by the model. Our experiments show that theTransformer network captures action dynamic features outperforming video-basedapproaches and succeeding with scenarios where the differences between actionslie in very subtle cues. Finally, we release the new event dataset, which isthe first in the literature for manipulation action recognition.

However, in many situations, language can be ambiguous and ineffectivein describing specific image edits. When faced with such challenges, visualprompts can be a more informative and intuitive way to convey ideas. We presenta method for image editing via visual prompting. Given pairs of example thatrepresent the "before" and "after" images of an edit, our goal is to learn atext-based editing direction that can be used to perform the same edit on newimages. We leverage the rich, pretrained editing capabilities of text-to-imagediffusion models by inverting visual prompts into editing instructions. Ourresults show that with just one example pair, we can achieve competitiveresults compared to state-of-the-art text-conditioned image editing frameworks.</description><author>Thao Nguyen, Yuheng Li, Utkarsh Ojha, Yong Jae Lee</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 18:50:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14331v1</guid></item><item><title>Waypoint-Based Imitation Learning for Robotic Manipulation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14326v1</link><description>While imitation learning methods have seen a resurgent interest for roboticmanipulation, the well-known problem of compounding errors continues to afflictbehavioral cloning (BC). Waypoints can help address this problem by reducingthe horizon of the learning problem for BC, and thus, the errors compoundedover time. However, waypoint labeling is underspecified, and requiresadditional human supervision. Can we generate waypoints automatically withoutany additional human supervision? Our key insight is that if a trajectorysegment can be approximated by linear motion, the endpoints can be used aswaypoints. We propose Automatic Waypoint Extraction (AWE) for imitationlearning, a preprocessing module to decompose a demonstration into a minimalset of waypoints which when interpolated linearly can approximate thetrajectory up to a specified error threshold. AWE can be combined with any BCalgorithm, and we find that AWE can increase the success rate ofstate-of-the-art algorithms by up to 25% in simulation and by 4-28% onreal-world bimanual manipulation tasks, reducing the decision making horizon byup to a factor of 10.

Itcomprises two components: (1) A statistical method for eliciting beliefsencoded in LLMs. We introduce statistical measures and evaluation metrics thatquantify the probability of an LLM "making a choice", the associateduncertainty, and the consistency of that choice. (2) We apply this method tostudy what moral beliefs are encoded in different LLMs, especially in ambiguouscases where the right choice is not obvious. We design a large-scale surveycomprising 680 high-ambiguity moral scenarios (e.g., "Should I tell a whitelie?") and 687 low-ambiguity moral scenarios (e.g., "Should I stop for apedestrian on the road?"). Each scenario includes a description, two possibleactions, and auxiliary labels indicating violated rules (e.g., "do not kill").We administer the survey to 28 open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that (a)in unambiguous scenarios, most models "choose" actions that align withcommonsense. In ambiguous cases, most models express uncertainty. (b) Somemodels are uncertain about choosing the commonsense action because theirresponses are sensitive to the question-wording. (c) Some models reflect clearpreferences in ambiguous scenarios. Specifically, closed-source models tend toagree with each other.</description><author>Nino Scherrer, Claudia Shi, Amir Feder, David M.

Particularly potent is price-mediated contagion, whereinforced liquidations by firms depress asset prices and propagate financialstress, enabling crises to proliferate across a broad spectrum of seeminglyunrelated entities. Price impacts are currently modeled via exogenous inversedemand functions. However, in real-world scenarios, only the initial shocks andthe final equilibrium asset prices are typically observable, leaving actualasset liquidations largely obscured. This missing data presents significantlimitations to calibrating the existing models. To address these challenges, weintroduce a novel dual neural network structure that operates in two sequentialstages: the first neural network maps initial shocks to predicted assetliquidations, and the second network utilizes these liquidations to deriveresultant equilibrium prices. This data-driven approach can capture both linearand non-linear forms without pre-specifying an analytical structure;furthermore, it functions effectively even in the absence of observableliquidation data. Experiments with simulated datasets demonstrate that ourmodel can accurately predict equilibrium asset prices based solely on initialshocks, while revealing a strong alignment between predicted and trueliquidations. Our explainable framework contributes to the understanding andmodeling of price-mediated contagion and provides valuable insights forfinancial authorities to construct effective stress tests and regulatorypolicies.</description><author>Zhiyu Cao, Zihan Chen, Prerna Mishra, Hamed Amini, Zachary Feinstein</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 18:41:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14322v1</guid></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning by Guided Safe Exploration</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14316v1</link><description>Safety is critical to broadening the application of reinforcement learning(RL). Often, we train RL agents in a controlled environment, such as alaboratory, before deploying them in the real world. However, the real-worldtarget task might be unknown prior to deployment. Reward-free RL trains anagent without the reward to adapt quickly once the reward is revealed. Weconsider the constrained reward-free setting, where an agent (the guide) learnsto explore safely without the reward signal. This agent is trained in acontrolled environment, which allows unsafe interactions and still provides thesafety signal. After the target task is revealed, safety violations are notallowed anymore. Thus, the guide is leveraged to compose a safe behaviourpolicy. Drawing from transfer learning, we also regularize a target policy (thestudent) towards the guide while the student is unreliable and graduallyeliminate the influence of the guide as training progresses. The empiricalanalysis shows that this method can achieve safe transfer learning and helpsthe student solve the target task faster.</description><author>Qisong Yang, Thiago D.

TheNaive Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Maxent Classifier, SklearnClassifier, Sklearn Classifier MultinomialNB, and other conjoint learningalgorithms, according to recent research, are very effective. In the projectwill use Five Python and R libraries NLTK, TextBlob, Vader, Transformers (GPTand BERT pretrained), and Tidytext will be used in the study to apply sentimentanalysis techniques. Four machine learning models Tree of Decisions (DT),Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)will also be used. To evaluate how well libraries for SA operate in the socialnetwork environment, comparative study was also carried out. The measures toassess the best algorithms in this experiment, which used a single data set foreach method, were precision, recall, and F1 score.

We propose an automatic metric to test the prevalenceof the opinions that a summary expresses, based on counting the number ofreviews that are consistent with each statement in the summary, whilediscrediting trivial or redundant statements. To formulate this opinionprevalence metric, we consider several existing methods to score the factualconsistency of a summary statement with respect to each individual sourcereview. On a corpus of Amazon product reviews, we gather multiple humanjudgments of the opinion consistency, to determine which automatic metric bestexpresses consistency in product reviews. Using the resulting opinionprevalence metric, we show that a human authored summary has only slightlybetter opinion prevalence than randomly selected extracts from the sourcereviews, and previous extractive and abstractive unsupervised opinionsummarization methods perform worse than humans. We demonstrate room forimprovement with a greedy construction of extractive summaries with twice theopinion prevalence achieved by humans. Finally, we show that preprocessingsource reviews by simplification can raise the opinion prevalence achieved byexisting abstractive opinion summarization systems to the level of humanperformance.</description><author>Christopher Malon</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 18:13:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14305v1</guid></item><item><title>A Constraint Enforcement Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Optimal Energy Storage Systems Dispatch</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14304v1</link><description>The optimal dispatch of energy storage systems (ESSs) presents formidablechallenges due to the uncertainty introduced by fluctuations in dynamic prices,demand consumption, and renewable-based energy generation. By exploiting thegeneralization capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs), deep reinforcementlearning (DRL) algorithms can learn good-quality control models that adaptivelyrespond to distribution networks' stochastic nature. However, current DRLalgorithms lack the capabilities to enforce operational constraints strictly,often even providing unfeasible control actions. To address this issue, wepropose a DRL framework that effectively handles continuous action spaces whilestrictly enforcing the environments and action space operational constraintsduring online operation. Firstly, the proposed framework trains an action-valuefunction modeled using DNNs. Subsequently, this action-value function isformulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation enabling theconsideration of the environment's operational constraints. Comprehensivenumerical simulations show the superior performance of the proposed MIP-DRLframework, effectively enforcing all constraints while delivering high-qualitydispatch decisions when compared with state-of-the-art DRL algorithms and theoptimal solution obtained with a perfect forecast of the stochastic variables.</description><author>Shengren Hou, Edgar Mauricio Salazar Duque, Peter Palensky, Pedro P.

Due to theuncertain future behaviour of vehicles, multiple future behaviour modes areoften plausible for a vehicle in a given driving scene. Therefore, multimodalprediction can provide richer information than single-mode prediction, enablingAVs to perform a better risk assessment. To this end, we propose a novelmultimodal prediction framework that can predict multiple plausible behaviourmodes and their likelihoods. The proposed framework includes a bespoke problemformulation for manoeuvre prediction, a novel transformer-based predictionmodel, and a tailored training method for multimodal manoeuvre and trajectoryprediction. The performance of the framework is evaluated using three publichighway driving datasets, namely NGSIM, highD, and exiD.

In particular, we derive aHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation that governs the evolution of thelog-densities of the underlying SDE marginals. This perspective allows totransfer methods from optimal control theory to generative modeling. First, weshow that the evidence lower bound is a direct consequence of the well-knownverification theorem from control theory.

An interactive map is produced using tools of what is called Geographic DataScience. A smooth two-dimensional surface $\mathcal{G}$ expresses locally whichfraction of territory uses a given German language feature: it is obtained byinterpolating a discrete function that says if at any surveyed locality thatfeature is used or not.\newline This surface $\mathcal{G}$ is thought of as the value at the present time ofa function describing a diffusion-convection phenomenon in two dimensions (heresaid \emph{tidal} mode), which is subjected in a very natural way to the sameequation, suitably contextualized, used in physics for a number ofphenomenological facts like the heat diffusion. It is shown that solutions ofthis equation, evaluated at the present time, fit well with the data asinterpolated by $\mathcal{G}$, thus providing convincing pictures ofdiffusion-convection of the linguistic features of the case study, albeitsimplifications and approximations.\newline Very importantly, it is shown that Schmidt's 'waves' can be counted among thesolutions of the diffusion equation: superimposing Schmidt 'waves' to a 'tidalflooding' can reproduce complexities of real linguistic diffusion events.</description><author>I.

However, there are many scenarios that call for a moregeneral AI, capable of solving a wide array of tasks without being specificallydesigned for them. The term General-Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems(GPAIS) has been defined to refer to these AI systems. To date, the possibilityof an Artificial General Intelligence, powerful enough to perform anyintellectual task as if it were human, or even improve it, has remained anaspiration, fiction, and considered a risk for our society. Whilst we mightstill be far from achieving that, GPAIS is a reality and sitting at theforefront of AI research. This work discusses existing definitions for GPAIS and proposes a newdefinition that allows for a gradual differentiation among types of GPAISaccording to their properties and limitations. We distinguish betweenclosed-world and open-world GPAIS, characterising their degree of autonomy andability based on several factors such as adaptation to new tasks, competence indomains not intentionally trained for, ability to learn from few data, orproactive acknowledgment of their own limitations. We then propose a taxonomyof approaches to realise GPAIS, describing research trends such as the use ofAI techniques to improve another AI or foundation models. As a prime example,we delve into generative AI, aligning them with the terms and conceptspresented in the taxonomy. Through the proposed definition and taxonomy, ouraim is to facilitate research collaboration across different areas that aretackling general-purpose tasks, as they share many common aspects. Finally, wediscuss the current state of GPAIS, its challenges and prospects, implicationsfor our society, and the need for responsible and trustworthy AI systems andregulation, with the goal of providing a holistic view of GPAIS.</description><author>Isaac Triguero, Daniel Molina, Javier Poyatos, Javier Del Ser, Francisco Herrera</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 17:35:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14283v1</guid></item><item><title>Uniformity Testing over Hypergrids with Subcube Conditioning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09013v2</link><description>We give an algorithm for testing uniformity of distributions supported onhypergrids $[m_1] \times \cdots \times [m_n]$, which makes$\smash{\widetilde{O}(\text{poly}(m)\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2)}$ many queries to asubcube conditional sampling oracle with $m=\max_i m_i$.

However, most of the prior art has been evaluated in datasets thathave just a couple thousand samples. Such small-data setups often allow the useof costly techniques in time and memory footprints, such as Re-Ranking, toimprove clustering results. Moreover, some previous work even pre-selects thebest clustering hyper-parameters for each dataset, which is unrealistic in alarge-scale fully-unsupervised scenario. In this context, this work tackles amore realistic scenario and proposes two strategies to learn from large-scaleunlabeled data. The first strategy performs a local neighborhood sampling toreduce the dataset size in each iteration without violating neighborhoodrelationships. A second strategy leverages a novel Re-Ranking technique, whichhas a lower time upper bound complexity and reduces the memory complexity fromO(n^2) to O(kn) with k &lt;&lt; n. To avoid the pre-selection of specifichyper-parameter values for the clustering algorithm, we also present a novelscheduling algorithm that adjusts the density parameter during training, toleverage the diversity of samples and keep the learning robust to noisylabeling. Finally, due to the complementary knowledge learned by differentmodels, we also introduce a co-training strategy that relies upon thepermutation of predicted pseudo-labels, among the backbones, with no need forany hyper-parameters or weighting optimization. The proposed methodologyoutperforms the state-of-the-art methods in well-known benchmarks and in thechallenging large-scale Veri-Wild dataset, with a faster and memory-efficientRe-Ranking strategy, and a large-scale, noisy-robust, and ensemble-basedlearning approach.</description><author>Gabriel Bertocco, Fernanda Andal√≥, Terrance E.

However, we claim that this naive solution issuboptimal. Contrastive learning requires two key properties: (1)\emph{alignment} of features of similar samples, and (2) \emph{uniformity} ofthe induced distribution of the normalized features on the hypersphere. Due totwo annoying issues in video grounding: (1) the co-existence of some visualentities in both ground truth and other moments, \ie semantic overlapping; (2)only a few moments in the video are annotated, \ie sparse annotation dilemma,vanilla contrastive learning is unable to model the correlations betweentemporally distant moments and learned inconsistent video representations. Bothcharacteristics lead to vanilla contrastive learning being unsuitable for videogrounding. In this paper, we introduce Geodesic and Game Localization (G2L), asemantically aligned and uniform video grounding framework via geodesic andgame theory. We quantify the correlations among moments leveraging the geodesicdistance that guides the model to learn the correct cross-modalrepresentations. Furthermore, from the novel perspective of game theory, wepropose semantic Shapley interaction based on geodesic distance sampling tolearn fine-grained semantic alignment in similar moments.

This problem can be solved byseveral classical algorithms where, usually, costs are predefined for alledges. Conventional planning methods can, thus, normally not be used whenwanting to change costs in an adaptive way following the requirements of sometask. Here we show that one can define a neural network representation of pathfinding problems by transforming cost values into synaptic weights, whichallows for online weight adaptation using network learning mechanisms. Whenstarting with an initial activity value of one, activity propagation in thisnetwork will lead to solutions, which are identical to those found by theBellman-Ford algorithm. The neural network has the same algorithmic complexityas Bellman-Ford and, in addition, we can show that network learning mechanisms(such as Hebbian learning) can adapt the weights in the network augmenting theresulting paths according to some task at hand. We demonstrate this by learningto navigate in an environment with obstacles as well as by learning to followcertain sequences of path nodes. Hence, the here-presented novel algorithm mayopen up a different regime of applications where path-augmentation (bylearning) is directly coupled with path finding in a natural way.</description><author>Tomas Kulvicius, Minija Tamosiunaite, Florentin W√∂rg√∂tter</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 17:13:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11104v4</guid></item><item><title>Deepfake Image Generation for Improved Brain Tumor Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14273v1</link><description>As the world progresses in technology and health, awareness of disease byrevealing asymptomatic signs improves.

Recent subjective benchmarks,such as OwlEval, offer comprehensive evaluations of a model's abilities byincorporating human labor, but they are not scalable and display significantbias. In response to these challenges, we propose MMBench, a novelmulti-modality benchmark. MMBench methodically develops a comprehensiveevaluation pipeline, primarily comprised of two elements. The first element isa meticulously curated dataset that surpasses existing similar benchmarks interms of the number and variety of evaluation questions and abilities. Thesecond element introduces a novel CircularEval strategy and incorporates theuse of ChatGPT. This implementation is designed to convert free-formpredictions into pre-defined choices, thereby facilitating a more robustevaluation of the model's predictions. MMBench is a systematically-designedobjective benchmark for robustly evaluating the various abilities ofvision-language models.

This makes them more robust than traditional frame-based cameras tohighly dynamic motions and poor illumination. It also means that everymeasurement in a scene can occur at a unique time. Handling these different measurement times is a major challenge of usingevent-based cameras. It is often addressed in visual odometry (VO) pipelines byapproximating temporally close measurements as occurring at one common time.This grouping simplifies the estimation problem but, absent additional sensors,sacrifices the inherent temporal resolution of event-based cameras. This paper instead presents a complete stereo VO pipeline that estimatesdirectly with individual event-measurement times without requiring any groupingor approximation in the estimation state. It uses continuous-time trajectoryestimation to maintain the temporal fidelity and asynchronous nature ofevent-based cameras through Gaussian process regression with a physicallymotivated prior. Its performance is evaluated on the MVSEC dataset, where itachieves 7.9e-3 and 5.9e-3 RMS relative error on two independent sequences,outperforming the existing publicly available event-based stereo VO pipeline bytwo and four times, respectively.</description><author>Jianeng Wang, Jonathan D.

Unlike traditional models, e.g., MLP, thesearchitectures map scalar values of numerical features to high-dimensionalembeddings before mixing them in the main backbone. In this work, we argue thatembeddings for numerical features are an underexplored degree of freedom intabular DL, which allows constructing more powerful DL models and competingwith GBDT on some traditionally GBDT-friendly benchmarks. We start bydescribing two conceptually different approaches to building embedding modules:the first one is based on a piecewise linear encoding of scalar values, and thesecond one utilizes periodic activations. Then, we empirically demonstrate thatthese two approaches can lead to significant performance boosts compared to theembeddings based on conventional blocks such as linear layers and ReLUactivations. Importantly, we also show that embedding numerical features isbeneficial for many backbones, not only for Transformers. Specifically, afterproper embeddings, simple MLP-like models can perform on par with theattention-based architectures. Overall, we highlight embeddings for numericalfeatures as an important design aspect with good potential for furtherimprovements in tabular DL.</description><author>Yury Gorishniy, Ivan Rubachev, Artem Babenko</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 16:57:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05556v3</guid></item><item><title>Revisiting Deep Learning Models for Tabular Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11959v3</link><description>The existing literature on deep learning for tabular data proposes a widerange of novel architectures and reports competitive results on variousdatasets.

Can we find a way toavoid such a phenomenon? Our work tackles the occurrence of sparse doubledescent on ViTs. Despite some works that have shown that traditionalarchitectures, like Resnet, are condemned to the sparse double descentphenomenon, for ViTs we observe that an optimally-tuned $\ell_2$ regularizationrelieves such a phenomenon. However, everything comes at a cost: optimal lambdawill sacrifice the potential compression of the ViT.</description><author>Victor Qu√©tu, Marta Milovanovic, Enzo Tartaglione</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 16:33:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14253v1</guid></item><item><title>FacTool: Factuality Detection in Generative AI -- A Tool Augmented Framework for Multi-Task and Multi-Domain Scenarios</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13528v2</link><description>The emergence of generative pre-trained models has facilitated the synthesisof high-quality text, but it has also posed challenges in identifying factualerrors in the generated text. In particular: (1) A wider range of tasks nowface an increasing risk of containing factual errors when handled by generativemodels. (2) Generated texts tend to be lengthy and lack a clearly definedgranularity for individual facts. (3) There is a scarcity of explicit evidenceavailable during the process of fact checking. With the above challenges inmind, in this paper, we propose FacTool, a task and domain agnostic frameworkfor detecting factual errors of texts generated by large language models (e.g.,ChatGPT). Experiments on four different tasks (knowledge-based QA, codegeneration, mathematical reasoning, and scientific literature review) show theefficacy of the proposed method.

In a typical FL scenario, clients exhibit significantheterogeneity in terms of data distribution and hardware configurations. Thus,randomly sampling clients in each training round may not fully exploit thelocal updates from heterogeneous clients, resulting in lower model accuracy,slower convergence rate, degraded fairness, etc. To tackle the FL clientheterogeneity problem, various client selection algorithms have been developed,showing promising performance improvement. In this paper, we systematicallypresent recent advances in the emerging field of FL client selection and itschallenges and research opportunities.

With the development ofadversarial patches, the feasibility of attacks in physical scenes increases,and the defenses against patch attacks are urgently needed. However, defendingsuch adversarial patch attacks is still an unsolved problem. In this paper, weanalyse the properties of adversarial patches, and find that: on the one hand,adversarial patches will lead to the appearance or contextual inconsistency inthe target objects; on the other hand, the patch region will show abnormalchanges on the high-level feature maps of the objects extracted by a backbonenetwork. Considering the above two points, we propose a novel defense methodbased on a ``localizing and inpainting" mechanism to pre-process the inputexamples. Specifically, we design an unified framework, where the ``localizing"sub-network utilizes a two-branch structure to represent the above two aspectsto accurately detect the adversarial patch region in the image. For the``inpainting" sub-network, it utilizes the surrounding contextual cues torecover the original content covered by the adversarial patch. The quality ofinpainted images is also evaluated by measuring the appearance consistency andthe effects of adversarial attacks. These two sub-networks are then jointlytrained via an iterative optimization manner. In this way, the ``localizing"and ``inpainting" modules can interact closely with each other, and thus learna better solution. A series of experiments versus traffic sign classificationand detection tasks are conducted to defend against various adversarial patchattacks.</description><author>Junwen Chen, Xingxing Wei</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 16:11:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14242v1</guid></item><item><title>DisguisOR: Holistic Face Anonymization for the Operating Room</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14241v1</link><description>Purpose: Recent advances in Surgical Data Science (SDS) have contributed toan increase in video recordings from hospital environments. While methods suchas surgical workflow recognition show potential in increasing the quality ofpatient care, the quantity of video data has surpassed the scale at whichimages can be manually anonymized. Existing automated 2D anonymization methodsunder-perform in Operating Rooms (OR), due to occlusions and obstructions. Wepropose to anonymize multi-view OR recordings using 3D data from multiplecamera streams. Methods: RGB and depth images from multiple cameras are fusedinto a 3D point cloud representation of the scene. We then detect eachindividual's face in 3D by regressing a parametric human mesh model ontodetected 3D human keypoints and aligning the face mesh with the fused 3D pointcloud. The mesh model is rendered into every acquired camera view, replacingeach individual's face. Results: Our method shows promise in locating faces ata higher rate than existing approaches. DisguisOR produces geometricallyconsistent anonymizations for each camera view, enabling more realisticanonymization that is less detrimental to downstream tasks. Conclusion:Frequent obstructions and crowding in operating rooms leaves significant roomfor improvement for off-the-shelf anonymization methods. DisguisOR addressesprivacy on a scene level and has the potential to facilitate further researchin SDS.</description><author>Lennart Bastian, Tony Danjun Wang, Tobias Czempiel, Benjamin Busam, Nassir Navab</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 16:10:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14241v1</guid></item><item><title>Revisiting the Performance-Explainability Trade-Off in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14239v1</link><description>Within the field of Requirements Engineering (RE), the increasingsignificance of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in aligningAI-supported systems with user needs, societal expectations, and regulatorystandards has garnered recognition.

However, thereremains many limitations of these LLMs when it comes to true languageunderstanding, limitations that are a byproduct of the under-lying architectureof deep neural networks. Moreover, and due to their subsymbolic nature,whatever knowledge these models acquire about how language works will always beburied in billions of microfeatures (weights), none of which is meaningful onits own, making such models hopelessly unexplainable. To address theselimitations, we suggest com-bining the strength of symbolic representationswith what we believe to be the key to the success of LLMs, namely a successfulbottom-up re-verse engineering of language at scale. As such we argue for abottom-up reverse engineering of language in a symbolic setting.

However, hybridfeatures and stochastic or unknown behaviours make this problem challenging. Wepropose a method for synthesising controllers for Markov jump linear systems(MJLSs), a class of discrete-time models for cyber-physical systems, so thatthey certifiably satisfy probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) formulae.An MJLS consists of a finite set of stochastic linear dynamics and discretejumps between these dynamics that are governed by a Markov decision process(MDP). We consider the cases where the transition probabilities of this MDP areeither known up to an interval or completely unknown. Our approach is based ona finite-state abstraction that captures both the discrete (mode-jumping) andcontinuous (stochastic linear) behaviour of the MJLS. We formalise thisabstraction as an interval MDP (iMDP) for which we compute intervals oftransition probabilities using sampling techniques from the so-called 'scenarioapproach', resulting in a probabilistically sound approximation. We apply ourmethod to multiple realistic benchmark problems, in particular, a temperaturecontrol and an aerial vehicle delivery problem.</description><author>Luke Rickard, Thom Badings, Licio Romao, Alessandro Abate</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 16:00:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00679v4</guid></item><item><title>Dominating Set Database Selection for Visual Place Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05123v2</link><description>This paper presents an approach for creating a visual place recognition (VPR)database for localization in indoor environments from RGBD scanning sequences.The proposed approach is formulated as a minimization problem in terms ofdominating set algorithm for graph, constructed from spatial information, andreferred as DominatingSet.

Our method grounds on the idea that speech related movements canbe comprehensively and efficiently described by the motion of a few controlpoints located on the movable parts of the face, i.e., landmarks. Theunderlying musculoskeletal structure then allows us to learn how their motioninfluences the geometrical deformations of the whole face. The proposed methodemploys two distinct models to this aim: the first one learns to generate themotion of a sparse set of landmarks from the given audio. The second modelexpands such landmarks motion to a dense motion field, which is utilized toanimate a given 3D mesh in neutral state. Additionally, we introduce a novelloss function, named Cosine Loss, which minimizes the angle between thegenerated motion vectors and the ground truth ones. Using landmarks in 3Dtalking head generation offers various advantages such as consistency,reliability, and obviating the need for manual-annotation.

Recentstudies have shown that the DL success is often attributed to effective datarepresentations, fostering the fields of feature engineering and representationlearning. However, automated approaches for feature learning are typicallylimited with respect to incorporating prior knowledge, identifying interactionsamong variables, and choosing evaluation metrics to ensure that the models arereliable. To improve on these limitations, this paper contributes a novelvisual analytics framework, namely TimeTuner, designed to help analystsunderstand how model behaviors are associated with localized correlations,stationarity, and granularity of time-series representations. The system mainlyconsists of the following two-stage technique: We first leverage counterfactualexplanations to connect the relationships among time-series representations,multivariate features and model predictions. Next, we design multiplecoordinated views including a partition-based correlation matrix and juxtaposedbivariate stripes, and provide a set of interactions that allow users to stepinto the transformation selection process, navigate through the feature space,and reason the model performance. We instantiate TimeTuner with twotransformation methods of smoothing and sampling, and demonstrate itsapplicability on real-world time-series forecasting of univariate sunspots andmultivariate air pollutants.

However, classical FL facesserious security and robustness problem, e.g., malicious clients can poisonmodel updates and at the same time claim large quantities to amplify the impactof their model updates in the model aggregation. Existing defense methods forFL, while all handling malicious model updates, either treat all quantitiesbenign or simply ignore/truncate the quantities of all clients. The former isvulnerable to quantity-enhanced attack, while the latter leads to sub-optimalperformance since the local data on different clients is usually insignificantly different sizes. In this paper, we propose a robustquantity-aware aggregation algorithm for federated learning, called FedRA, toperform the aggregation with awareness of local data quantities while beingable to defend against quantity-enhanced attacks. More specifically, we proposea method to filter malicious clients by jointly considering the uploaded modelupdates and data quantities from different clients, and performingquantity-aware weighted averaging on model updates from remaining clients.Moreover, as the number of malicious clients participating in the federatedlearning may dynamically change in different rounds, we also propose amalicious client number estimator to predict how many suspicious clients shouldbe filtered in each round. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate theeffectiveness of our FedRA method in defending FL against quantity-enhancedattacks.</description><author>Jingwei Yi, Fangzhao Wu, Huishuai Zhang, Bin Zhu, Tao Qi, Guangzhong Sun, Xing Xie</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 15:08:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10848v2</guid></item><item><title>Application of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine for Investigation of Pressure Filtration Performance, a Zinc Plant Filter Cake Modeling</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14199v1</link><description>The hydrometallurgical method of zinc production involves leaching zinc fromore and then separating the solid residue from the liquid solution by pressurefiltration. This separation process is very important since the solid residuecontains some moisture that can reduce the amount of zinc recovered. This studymodeled the pressure filtration process through Random Forest (RF) and SupportVector Machine (SVM). The models take continuous variables (extracted features)from the lab samples as inputs. Thus, regression models namely Random ForestRegression (RFR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were chosen. A totaldataset was obtained during the pressure filtration process in two conditions:1) Polypropylene (S1) and 2) Polyester fabrics (S2). To predict the cakemoisture, solids concentration (0.2 and 0.38), temperature (35 and 65centigrade), pH (2, 3.5, and 5), pressure, cake thickness (14, 20, 26, and 34mm), air-blow time (2, 10 and 15 min) and filtration time were applied as inputvariables.

End-to-end learnablediscrete-continuous models are compositional, tend to generalize better, andare more interpretable. A popular approach to building discrete-continuouscomputation graphs is that of integrating discrete probability distributionsinto neural networks using stochastic softmax tricks. Prior work has mainlyfocused on computation graphs with a single discrete component on each of thegraph's execution paths. We analyze the behavior of more complex stochasticcomputations graphs with multiple sequential discrete components. We show thatit is challenging to optimize the parameters of these models, mainly due tosmall gradients and local minima. We then propose two new strategies toovercome these challenges. First, we show that increasing the scale parameterof the Gumbel noise perturbations during training improves the learningbehavior. Second, we propose dropout residual connections specifically tailoredto stochastic, discrete-continuous computation graphs. With an extensive set ofexperiments, we show that we can train complex discrete-continuous models whichone cannot train with standard stochastic softmax tricks. We also show thatcomplex discrete-stochastic models generalize better than their continuouscounterparts on several benchmark datasets.</description><author>David Friede, Mathias Niepert</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 14:47:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14193v1</guid></item><item><title>Unveiling Security, Privacy, and Ethical Concerns of ChatGPT</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14192v1</link><description>This paper delves into the realm of ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot thatutilizes topic modeling and reinforcement learning to generate naturalresponses.

Deep learning based techniques have been applied successfully totackle various complex medical image processing problems, including medicalimage registration. Over the years, several image registration techniques havebeen proposed using deep learning. Deformable image registration techniquessuch as Voxelmorph have been successful in capturing finer changes andproviding smoother deformations. However, Voxelmorph, as well as ICNet andFIRE, do not explicitly encode global dependencies (i.e. the overall anatomicalview of the supplied image) and, therefore, cannot track large deformations. Inorder to tackle the aforementioned problems, this paper extends the Voxelmorphapproach in three different ways. To improve the performance in case of smallas well as large deformations, supervision of the model at differentresolutions has been integrated using a multi-scale UNet. To support thenetwork to learn and encode the minute structural co-relations of the givenimage-pairs, a self-constructing graph network (SCGNet) has been used as thelatent of the multi-scale UNet - which can improve the learning process of themodel and help the model to generalise better. And finally, to make thedeformations inverse-consistent, cycle consistency loss has been employed. Onthe task of registration of brain MRIs, the proposed method achievedsignificant improvements over ANTs and VoxelMorph, obtaining a Dice score of0.8013 \pm 0.0243 for intramodal and 0.6211 \pm 0.0309 for intermodal, whileVoxelMorph achieved 0.7747 \pm 0.0260 and 0.6071 \pm 0.0510, respectively</description><author>Soumick Chatterjee, Himanshi Bajaj, Istiyak H.

ASPP uses multiple atrous convolutions with differentatrous rates to extract both local and global information. However, fixedvalues of atrous rates are used for the ASPP module, which restricts the sizeof its field of view. In principle, atrous rate should be a hyperparameter tochange the field of view size according to the target task or dataset. However,the manipulation of atrous rate is not governed by any guidelines. This studyproposes practical guidelines for obtaining an optimal atrous rate. First, aneffective receptive field for semantic segmentation is introduced to analyzethe inner behavior of segmentation networks. We observed that the use of ASPPmodule yielded a specific pattern in the effective receptive field, which wastraced to reveal the module's underlying mechanism. Accordingly, we derivepractical guidelines for obtaining the optimal atrous rate, which should becontrolled based on the size of input image. Compared to other values, usingthe optimal atrous rate consistently improved the segmentation results acrossmultiple datasets, including the STARE, CHASE_DB1, HRF, Cityscapes, and iSAIDdatasets.</description><author>Bum Jun Kim, Hyeyeon Choi, Hyeonah Jang, Sang Woo Kim</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 14:11:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14179v1</guid></item><item><title>PKU-GoodsAD: A Supermarket Goods Dataset for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04956v2</link><description>Visual anomaly detection is essential and commonly used for many tasks in thefield of computer vision.

However, nearly all existingmethods are formulated as a one-class classification trained only onrepresentations from the normal class and discard a potentially significantportion of the unlabeled data. This paper focuses on a more practical setting,dual distribution anomaly detection for chest X-rays, using the entire trainingdata, including both normal and unlabeled images. Inspired by a modernself-supervised vision transformer model trained using partial image inputs toreconstruct missing image regions -- we propose AMAE, a two-stage algorithm foradaptation of the pre-trained masked autoencoder (MAE). Starting from MAEinitialization, AMAE first creates synthetic anomalies from only normaltraining images and trains a lightweight classifier on frozen transformerfeatures. Subsequently, we propose an adaptation strategy to leverage unlabeledimages containing anomalies. The adaptation scheme is accomplished by assigningpseudo-labels to unlabeled images and using two separate MAE based modules tomodel the normative and anomalous distributions of pseudo-labeled images. Theeffectiveness of the proposed adaptation strategy is evaluated with differentanomaly ratios in an unlabeled training set. AMAE leads to consistentperformance gains over competing self-supervised and dual distribution anomalydetection methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on three public chest X-raybenchmarks: RSNA, NIH-CXR, and VinDr-CXR.</description><author>Behzad Bozorgtabar, Dwarikanath Mahapatra, Jean-Philippe Thiran</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 14:07:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12721v2</guid></item><item><title>High-definition event frame generation using SoC FPGA devices</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14177v1</link><description>In this paper we have addressed the implementation of the accumulation andprojection of high-resolution event data stream (HD -1280 x 720 pixels) ontothe image plane in FPGA devices.

To improve therobustness of VPR in perceptually aliasing scenarios, sequence-based VPRmethods are proposed. These methods are either based on matching between framesequences or extracting sequence descriptors for direct retrieval. However, theformer is usually based on the assumption of constant velocity, which isdifficult to hold in practice, and is computationally expensive and subject tosequence length. Although the latter overcomes these problems, existingsequence descriptors are constructed by aggregating features of multiple framesonly, without interaction on temporal information, and thus cannot obtaindescriptors with spatio-temporal discrimination. In this paper, we propose asequence descriptor that effectively incorporates spatio-temporal information.Specifically, spatial attention within the same frame is utilized to learnspatial feature patterns, while attention in corresponding local regions ofdifferent frames is utilized to learn the persistence or change of featuresover time. We use a sliding window to control the temporal range of attentionand use relative position encoding to construct sequential relationshipsbetween different features. This allows our descriptors to capture theintrinsic dynamics in a sequence of frames.

Recent attempts have developed various attention-based modules forsolving VQA tasks. However, the performance of model inference is largelybottlenecked by visual processing for semantics understanding. Most existingdetection methods rely on bounding boxes, remaining a serious challenge for VQAmodels to understand the causal nexus of object semantics in images andcorrectly infer contextual information. To this end, we propose a finer modelframework without bounding boxes in this work, termed Looking Out of InstanceSemantics (LOIS) to tackle this important issue. LOIS enables more fine-grainedfeature descriptions to produce visual facts. Furthermore, to overcome thelabel ambiguity caused by instance masks, two types of relation attentionmodules: 1) intra-modality and 2) inter-modality, are devised to infer thecorrect answers from the different multi-view features. Specifically, weimplement a mutual relation attention module to model sophisticated and deepervisual semantic relations between instance objects and background information.In addition, our proposed attention model can further analyze salient imageregions by focusing on important word-related questions.

In our nonstationary environment, variations in thebase arms' distributions, causal relationships between rewards, or both, changethe reward generation process. In such an environment, an optimaldecision-maker must follow both sources of change and adapt accordingly. Theproblem becomes aggravated in the combinatorial semi-bandit setting, where thedecision-maker only observes the outcome of the selected bundle of arms. Thecore of our proposed policy is the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Weassume the agent relies on an adaptive approach to overcome the challenge.

Besides, we introduce the notion of group restartas a new alternative restarting strategy in the decision making process instructured environments. Finally, our algorithm integrates a mechanism to tracethe variations of the underlying graph structure, which captures the causalrelationships between the rewards in the bandit setting.

Few-shot segmentation(FSS)has the potential to address these challenges by learning new categories from asmall number of labeled samples. The majority of the current methods employ aprototype learning architecture, which involves expanding support prototypevectors and concatenating them with query features to conduct conditionalsegmentation. However, such framework potentially focuses more on queryfeatures while may neglect the correlation between support and query features.In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised few shot medical imagesegmentation network with Cross-Reference Transformer, which addresses the lackof interaction between the support image and the query image.

We also introduce a semantic UV texturetransfer module that implements textural style transfer using semantic UVsegmentation, which ensures consistency in the semantic meaning of thetransferred regions. This module can be widely adapted to many existingapproaches. Finally, our method constructs a novel 3D bird using adifferentiable renderer. Experimental results on the CUB dataset verify thatour method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single-view 3D styletransfer task.

Current methods aiming to handle the missing modalityproblem in multi-modal tasks, either deal with missing modalities only duringevaluation or train separate models to handle specific missing modalitysettings. In addition, these models are designed for specific tasks, so forexample, classification models are not easily adapted to segmentation tasks andvice versa. In this paper, we propose the Shared-Specific Feature Modelling(ShaSpec) method that is considerably simpler and more effective than competingapproaches that address the issues above. ShaSpec is designed to take advantageof all available input modalities during training and evaluation by learningshared and specific features to better represent the input data. This isachieved from a strategy that relies on auxiliary tasks based on distributionalignment and domain classification, in addition to a residual feature fusionprocedure. Also, the design simplicity of ShaSpec enables its easy adaptationto multiple tasks, such as classification and segmentation. Experiments areconducted on both medical image segmentation and computer visionclassification, with results indicating that ShaSpec outperforms competingmethods by a large margin. For instance, on BraTS2018, ShaSpec improves theSOTA by more than 3% for enhancing tumour, 5% for tumour core and 3% for wholetumour.</description><author>Hu Wang, Yuanhong Chen, Congbo Ma, Jodie Avery, Louise Hull, Gustavo Carneiro</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 12:45:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14126v1</guid></item><item><title>Memory-Efficient Graph Convolutional Networks for Object Classification and Detection with Event Cameras</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14124v1</link><description>Recent advances in event camera research emphasize processing data in itsoriginal sparse form, which allows the use of its unique features such as hightemporal resolution, high dynamic range, low latency, and resistance to imageblur. One promising approach for analyzing event data is through graphconvolutional networks (GCNs). However, current research in this domainprimarily focuses on optimizing computational costs, neglecting the associatedmemory costs. In this paper, we consider both factors together in order toachieve satisfying results and relatively low model complexity. For thispurpose, we performed a comparative analysis of different graph convolutionoperations, considering factors such as execution time, the number of trainablemodel parameters, data format requirements, and training outcomes. Our resultsshow a 450-fold reduction in the number of parameters for the featureextraction module and a 4.5-fold reduction in the size of the datarepresentation while maintaining a classification accuracy of 52.3%, which is6.3% higher compared to the operation used in state-of-the-art approaches. Tofurther evaluate performance, we implemented the object detection architectureand evaluated its performance on the N-Caltech101 dataset. The results showedan accuracy of 53.7 % mAP@0.5 and reached an execution rate of 82 graphs persecond.</description><author>Kamil Jeziorek, Andrea Pinna, Tomasz Kryjak</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 12:44:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14124v1</guid></item><item><title>Factor Fields: A Unified Framework for Neural Fields and Beyond</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01226v2</link><description>We present Factor Fields, a novel framework for modeling and representingsignals. Factor Fields decomposes a signal into a product of factors, each ofwhich is represented by a neural or regular field representation operating on acoordinate transformed input signal. We show that this decomposition yields aunified framework that generalizes several recent signal representationsincluding NeRF, PlenOxels, EG3D, Instant-NGP, and TensoRF. Moreover, theframework allows for the creation of powerful new signal representations, suchas the Coefficient-Basis Factorization (CoBaFa) which we propose in this paper.As evidenced by our experiments, CoBaFa leads to improvements over previousfast reconstruction methods in terms of the three critical goals in neuralsignal representation: approximation quality, compactness and efficiency.Experimentally, we demonstrate that our representation achieves better imageapproximation quality on 2D image regression tasks, higher geometric qualitywhen reconstructing 3D signed distance fields and higher compactness forradiance field reconstruction tasks compared to previous fast reconstructionmethods. Besides, our CoBaFa representation enables generalization by sharingthe basis across signals during training, enabling generalization tasks such asimage regression with sparse observations and few-shot radiance fieldreconstruction.

Our basic tenet is that these flaws are rootedin the many-to-many mappings which exist between the visual information encodedin images and the intended semantics of the labels annotating them. The netconsequence is that the current annotation process is largely under-specified,thus leaving too much freedom to the subjective judgment of annotators. In thispaper, we propose vTelos, an integrated Natural Language Processing, KnowledgeRepresentation, and Computer Vision methodology whose main goal is to makeexplicit the (otherwise implicit) intended annotation semantics, thusminimizing the number and role of subjective choices. A key element of vTelosis the exploitation of the WordNet lexico-semantic hierarchy as the main meansfor providing the meaning of natural language labels and, as a consequence, fordriving the annotation of images based on the objects and the visual propertiesthey depict. The methodology is validated on images populating a subset of theImageNet hierarchy.</description><author>Fausto Giunchiglia, Mayukh Bagchi, Xiaolei Diao</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 12:38:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14119v1</guid></item><item><title>Leveraging Implicit Feedback from Deployment Data in Dialogue</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14117v1</link><description>We study improving social conversational agents by learning from naturaldialogue between users and a deployed model, without extra annotations.

Our experiments use the publiclyreleased deployment data from BlenderBot (Xu et al., 2023). Human evaluationindicates improvements in our new models over baseline responses; however, wefind that some proxy signals can lead to more generations with undesirableproperties as well.

It is available over a wide range of acquisitiondistances, representing a trade-off between the whole face (which can beoccluded at close distances) and the iris texture (which do not have enoughresolution at long distances). Since the periocular region appears in face oriris images, it can be used also in conjunction with these modalities.

Various approaches have been devised to addressthese problems. Recently, weight balancing, which combines well-known classicalregularization techniques with two-stage training, has been proposed. Despiteits simplicity, it is known for its high performance against existing methodsdevised in various ways. However, there is a lack of understanding as to whythis approach is effective for long-tailed data. In this study, we analyze themethod focusing on neural collapse and cone effect at each training stage andfind that it can be decomposed into the increase in Fisher's discriminant ratioof the feature extractor caused by weight decay and cross entropy loss andimplicit logit adjustment caused by weight decay and class-balanced loss. Ouranalysis shows that the training method can be further simplified by reducingthe number of training stages to one while increasing accuracy.</description><author>Naoya Hasegawa, Issei Sato</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 12:03:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16573v3</guid></item><item><title>Beyond the Edge of Stability via Two-step Gradient Updates</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04172v3</link><description>Gradient Descent (GD) is a powerful workhorse of modern machine learningthanks to its scalability and efficiency in high-dimensional spaces. Itsability to find local minimisers is only guaranteed for losses with Lipschitzgradients, where it can be seen as a `bona-fide' discretisation of anunderlying gradient flow. Yet, many ML setups involving overparametrised modelsdo not fall into this problem class, which has motivated research beyond theso-called ``Edge of Stability'' (EoS), where the step-size crosses theadmissibility threshold inversely proportional to the Lipschitz constant above.Perhaps surprisingly, GD has been empirically observed to still convergeregardless of local instability and oscillatory behavior. The incipient theoretical analysis of this phenomena has mainly focused inthe overparametrised regime, where the effect of choosing a large learning ratemay be associated to a `Sharpness-Minimisation' implicit regularisation withinthe manifold of minimisers, under appropriate asymptotic limits. In contrast,in this work we directly examine the conditions for such unstable convergence,focusing on simple, yet representative, learning problems, via analysis oftwo-step gradient updates. Specifically, we characterize a local conditioninvolving third-order derivatives that guarantees existence and convergence tofixed points of the two-step updates, and leverage such property in ateacher-student setting, under population loss. Finally, starting from MatrixFactorization, we provide observations of period-2 orbit of GD inhigh-dimensional settings with intuition of its dynamics, along withexploration into more general settings.</description><author>Lei Chen, Joan Bruna</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 11:48:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04172v3</guid></item></channel></rss>

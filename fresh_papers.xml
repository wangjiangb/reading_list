While syntheticdata have been used for augmenting the training set, we find that syntheticdata can also significantly diversify the validation set, offering markedadvantages in domains like healthcare, where data are typically limited,sensitive, and from out-domain sources (i.e., hospitals). In this study, weillustrate the effectiveness of synthetic data for early cancer detection incomputed tomography (CT) volumes, where synthetic tumors are generated andsuperimposed onto healthy organs, thereby creating an extensive dataset forrigorous validation. Using synthetic data as validation can improve AIrobustness in both in-domain and out-domain test sets. Furthermore, weestablish a new continual learning framework that continuously trains AI modelson a stream of out-domain data with synthetic tumors. The AI model trained andvalidated in dynamically expanding synthetic data can consistently outperformmodels trained and validated exclusively on real-world data. Specifically, theDSC score for liver tumor segmentation improves from 26.7% (95% CI:22.6%-30.9%) to 34.5% (30.8%-38.2%) when evaluated on an in-domain dataset andfrom 31.1% (26.0%-36.2%) to 35.4% (32.1%-38.7%) on an out-domain dataset.Importantly, the performance gain is particularly significant in identifyingvery tiny liver tumors (radius &lt; 5mm) in CT volumes, with Sensitivity improvingfrom 33.1% to 55.4% on an in-domain dataset and 33.9% to 52.3% on an out-domaindataset, justifying the efficacy in early detection of cancer. The applicationof synthetic data, from both training and validation perspectives, underlines apromising avenue to enhance AI robustness when dealing with data from varyingdomains.</description><author>Qixin Hu, Alan Yuille, Zongwei Zhou</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:59:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16052v1</guid></item><item><title>Phase diagram of early training dynamics in deep neural networks: effect of the learning rate, depth, and width</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12250v2</link><description>We systematically analyze optimization dynamics in deep neural networks(DNNs) trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and study the effect oflearning rate $\eta$, depth $d$, and width $w$ of the neural network. Byanalyzing the maximum eigenvalue $\lambda^H_t$ of the Hessian of the loss,which is a measure of sharpness of the loss landscape, we find that thedynamics can show four distinct regimes: (i) an early time transient regime,(ii) an intermediate saturation regime, (iii) a progressive sharpening regime,and (iv) a late time ``edge of stability" regime. The early and intermediateregimes (i) and (ii) exhibit a rich phase diagram depending on $\eta \equiv c /\lambda_0^H $, $d$, and $w$. We identify several critical values of $c$, whichseparate qualitatively distinct phenomena in the early time dynamics oftraining loss and sharpness. Notably, we discover the opening up of a``sharpness reduction" phase, where sharpness decreases at early times, as $d$and $1/w$ are increased.</description><author>Dayal Singh Kalra, Maissam Barkeshli</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:59:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12250v2</guid></item><item><title>MuSR: Testing the Limits of Chain-of-thought with Multistep Soft Reasoning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16049v1</link><description>While large language models (LLMs) equipped with techniques likechain-of-thought prompting have demonstrated impressive capabilities, theystill fall short in their ability to reason robustly in complex settings.However, evaluating LLM reasoning is challenging because system capabilitiescontinue to grow while benchmark datasets for tasks like logical deduction haveremained static. We introduce MuSR, a dataset for evaluating language models onmultistep soft reasoning tasks specified in a natural language narrative. Thisdataset has two crucial features. First, it is created through a novelneurosymbolic synthetic-to-natural generation algorithm, enabling theconstruction of complex reasoning instances that challenge GPT-4 (e.g., murdermysteries roughly 1000 words in length) and which can be scaled further as morecapable LLMs are released. Second, our dataset instances are free textnarratives corresponding to real-world domains of reasoning; this makes itsimultaneously much more challenging than other synthetically-craftedbenchmarks while remaining realistic and tractable for human annotators tosolve with high accuracy. We evaluate a range of LLMs and prompting techniqueson this dataset and characterize the gaps that remain for techniques likechain-of-thought to perform robust reasoning.</description><author>Zayne Sprague, Xi Ye, Kaj Bostrom, Swarat Chaudhuri, Greg Durrett</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:59:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16049v1</guid></item><item><title>AI Alignment and Social Choice: Fundamental Limitations and Policy Implications</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16048v1</link><description>Aligning AI agents to human intentions and values is a key bottleneck inbuilding safe and deployable AI applications. But whose values should AI agentsbe aligned with? Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has emergedas the key framework for AI alignment. RLHF uses feedback from humanreinforcers to fine-tune outputs; all widely deployed large language models(LLMs) use RLHF to align their outputs to human values. It is critical tounderstand the limitations of RLHF and consider policy challenges arising fromthese limitations. In this paper, we investigate a specific challenge inbuilding RLHF systems that respect democratic norms. Building on impossibilityresults in social choice theory, we show that, under fairly broad assumptions,there is no unique voting protocol to universally align AI systems using RLHFthrough democratic processes. Further, we show that aligning AI agents with thevalues of all individuals will always violate certain private ethicalpreferences of an individual user i.e., universal AI alignment using RLHF isimpossible. We discuss policy implications for the governance of AI systemsbuilt using RLHF: first, the need for mandating transparent voting rules tohold model builders accountable. Second, the need for model builders to focuson developing AI agents that are narrowly aligned to specific user groups.</description><author>Abhilash Mishra</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:59:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16048v1</guid></item><item><title>From Posterior Sampling to Meaningful Diversity in Image Restoration</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16047v1</link><description>Image restoration problems are typically ill-posed in the sense that eachdegraded image can be restored in infinitely many valid ways. To accommodatethis, many works generate a diverse set of outputs by attempting to randomlysample from the posterior distribution of natural images given the degradedinput. Here we argue that this strategy is commonly of limited practical valuebecause of the heavy tail of the posterior distribution. Consider for exampleinpainting a missing region of the sky in an image. Since there is a highprobability that the missing region contains no object but clouds, any set ofsamples from the posterior would be entirely dominated by (practicallyidentical) completions of sky. However, arguably, presenting users with onlyone clear sky completion, along with several alternative solutions such asairships, birds, and balloons, would better outline the set of possibilities.In this paper, we initiate the study of meaningfully diverse image restoration.We explore several post-processing approaches that can be combined with anydiverse image restoration method to yield semantically meaningful diversity.Moreover, we propose a practical approach for allowing diffusion based imagerestoration methods to generate meaningfully diverse outputs, while incurringonly negligent computational overhead. We conduct extensive user studies toanalyze the proposed techniques, and find the strategy of reducing similaritybetween outputs to be significantly favorable over posterior sampling.

We trained an ensemble consisting ofa GPT-2 and small LLaMA models on the developmentally-plausible, 10M-wordBabyLM dataset, then distilled it into a small, 58M-parameter LLaMA model,which exceeds in performance both of its teachers as well as a similar modeltrained without distillation. This suggests that distillation can not onlyretain the full performance of the teacher model when the latter is trained ona sufficiently small dataset; it can exceed it, and lead to significantlybetter performance than direct training.</description><author>Inar Timiryasov, Jean-Loup Tastet</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:58:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02019v2</guid></item><item><title>A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16046v1</link><description>Our ability to use deep learning approaches to decipher neural activity wouldlikely benefit from greater scale, in terms of both model size and datasets.However, the integration of many neural recordings into one unified model ischallenging, as each recording contains the activity of different neurons fromdifferent individual animals. In this paper, we introduce a training frameworkand architecture designed to model the population dynamics of neural activityacross diverse, large-scale neural recordings. Our method first tokenizesindividual spikes within the dataset to build an efficient representation ofneural events that captures the fine temporal structure of neural activity. Wethen employ cross-attention and a PerceiverIO backbone to further construct alatent tokenization of neural population activities. Utilizing thisarchitecture and training framework, we construct a large-scale multi-sessionmodel trained on large datasets from seven nonhuman primates, spanning over 158different sessions of recording from over 27,373 neural units and over 100hours of recordings. In a number of different tasks, we demonstrate that ourpretrained model can be rapidly adapted to new, unseen sessions withunspecified neuron correspondence, enabling few-shot performance with minimallabels. This work presents a powerful new approach for building deep learningtools to analyze neural data and stakes out a clear path to training at scale.</description><author>Mehdi Azabou, Vinam Arora, Venkataramana Ganesh, Ximeng Mao, Santosh Nachimuthu, Michael J.

In order to mitigatehallucinations, existing studies mainly resort to an instruction-tuning mannerthat requires retraining the models with specific data. In this paper, we pavea different way, introducing a training-free method named Woodpecker. Like awoodpecker heals trees, it picks out and corrects hallucinations from thegenerated text. Concretely, Woodpecker consists of five stages: key conceptextraction, question formulation, visual knowledge validation, visual claimgeneration, and hallucination correction. Implemented in a post-remedy manner,Woodpecker can easily serve different MLLMs, while being interpretable byaccessing intermediate outputs of the five stages. We evaluate Woodpecker bothquantitatively and qualitatively and show the huge potential of this newparadigm. On the POPE benchmark, our method obtains a 30.66%/24.33% improvementin accuracy over the baseline MiniGPT-4/mPLUG-Owl.

Recent advances in inverse rendering have enabled a wide range ofreal-world applications in 3D content generation, moving rapidly from researchand commercial use cases to consumer devices. While the results continue toimprove, there is no real-world benchmark that can quantitatively assess andcompare the performance of various inverse rendering methods. Existingreal-world datasets typically only consist of the shape and multi-view imagesof objects, which are not sufficient for evaluating the quality of materialrecovery and object relighting. Methods capable of recovering material andlighting often resort to synthetic data for quantitative evaluation, which onthe other hand does not guarantee generalization to complex real-worldenvironments. We introduce a new dataset of real-world objects captured under avariety of natural scenes with ground-truth 3D scans, multi-view images, andenvironment lighting. Using this dataset, we establish the first comprehensivereal-world evaluation benchmark for object inverse rendering tasks fromin-the-wild scenes, and compare the performance of various existing methods.All data, code, and models can be accessed at https://stanfordorb.github.io/.</description><author>Zhengfei Kuang, Yunzhi Zhang, Hong-Xing Yu, Samir Agarwala, Shangzhe Wu, Jiajun Wu</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:57:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16044v1</guid></item><item><title>WebWISE: Web Interface Control and Sequential Exploration with Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16042v1</link><description>The paper investigates using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automaticallyperform web software tasks using click, scroll, and text input operations.Previous approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL) or imitation learning,are inefficient to train and task-specific.

Weuse in-context learning, either benefiting from a single manually providedexample, or an automatically generated example based on a successful zero-shottrial.

However, when it comes to information extraction - aclassic task in natural language processing - most task-specific systems cannotalign well with long-tail ad hoc extraction use cases for non-expert users. Toaddress this, we propose a novel paradigm, termed On-Demand InformationExtraction, to fulfill the personalized demands of real-world users. Our taskaims to follow the instructions to extract the desired content from theassociated text and present it in a structured tabular format. The tableheaders can either be user-specified or inferred contextually by the model. Tofacilitate research in this emerging area, we present a benchmark namedInstructIE, inclusive of both automatically generated training data, as well asthe human-annotated test set. Building on InstructIE, we further develop anOn-Demand Information Extractor, ODIE. Comprehensive evaluations on ourbenchmark reveal that ODIE substantially outperforms the existing open-sourcemodels of similar size.

In such settings, standard OT variants cannot be employed,and novel estimation techniques are necessary. Since the main challenge is thatthe conditional distributions are not explicitly available, the key idea in ourOT formulation is to employ kernelized-least-squares terms computed over thejoint samples, which implicitly match the transport plan's marginals with theempirical conditionals. Under mild conditions, we prove that our estimatedtransport plans, as a function of the conditioned variable, are asymptoticallyoptimal. For finite samples, we show that the deviation in terms of ourregularized objective is bounded by $O(1/m^{1/4})$, where $m$ is the number ofsamples. We also discuss how the conditional transport plan could be modelledusing explicit probabilistic models as well as using implicit generative ones.We empirically verify the consistency of our estimator on synthetic datasets,where the optimal plan is analytically known. When employed in applicationslike prompt learning for few-shot classification and conditional-generation inthe context of predicting cell responses to treatment, our methodology improvesupon state-of-the-art methods.</description><author>Piyushi Manupriya, Rachit Keerti Das, Sayantan Biswas, Saketha Nath Jagarlapudi</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:53:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15901v3</guid></item><item><title>What's Left? Concept Grounding with Logic-Enhanced Foundation Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16035v1</link><description>Recent works such as VisProg and ViperGPT have smartly composed foundationmodels for visual reasoning-using large language models (LLMs) to produceprograms that can be executed by pre-trained vision-language models. However,they operate in limited domains, such as 2D images, not fully exploiting thegeneralization of language: abstract concepts like "left" can also be groundedin 3D, temporal, and action data, as in moving to your left. This limitedgeneralization stems from these inference-only methods' inability to learn oradapt pre-trained models to a new domain. We propose the Logic-EnhancedFoundation Model (LEFT), a unified framework that learns to ground and reasonwith concepts across domains with a differentiable, domain-independent,first-order logic-based program executor. LEFT has an LLM interpreter thatoutputs a program represented in a general, logic-based reasoning language,which is shared across all domains and tasks. LEFT's executor then executes theprogram with trainable domain-specific grounding modules. We show that LEFTflexibly learns concepts in four domains: 2D images, 3D scenes, human motions,and robotic manipulation. It exhibits strong reasoning ability in a widevariety of tasks, including those that are complex and not seen duringtraining, and can be easily applied to new domains.</description><author>Joy Hsu, Jiayuan Mao, Joshua B.

Given the greatpotential for the broad use of these models, it is important to investigatetheir limitations in dealing with different image and question properties. Inthis work, we investigate whether multimodal LLMs can perceive small details aswell as large details in images. In particular, we show that their zero-shotaccuracy in answering visual questions is very sensitive to the size of thevisual subject of the question, declining up to $46\%$ with size. Furthermore,we show that this effect is causal by observing that human visual cropping cansignificantly mitigate their sensitivity to size. Inspired by the usefulness ofhuman cropping, we then propose three automatic visual cropping methods asinference time mechanisms to improve the zero-shot performance of multimodalLLMs. We study their effectiveness on four popular VQA datasets, and a subsetof the VQAv2 dataset tailored towards fine visual details. Our findings suggestthat multimodal LLMs should be used with caution in detail-sensitive VQAapplications, and that visual cropping is a promising direction to improvetheir zero-shot performance. Our code and data are publicly available.</description><author>Jiarui Zhang, Mahyar Khayatkhoei, Prateek Chhikara, Filip Ilievski</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:48:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16033v1</guid></item><item><title>Finetuning Offline World Models in the Real World</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16029v1</link><description>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously data-inefficient, which makestraining on a real robot difficult. While model-based RL algorithms (worldmodels) improve data-efficiency to some extent, they still require hours ordays of interaction to learn skills. Recently, offline RL has been proposed asa framework for training RL policies on pre-existing datasets without anyonline interaction. However, constraining an algorithm to a fixed datasetinduces a state-action distribution shift between training and inference, andlimits its applicability to new tasks. In this work, we seek to get the best ofboth worlds: we consider the problem of pretraining a world model with offlinedata collected on a real robot, and then finetuning the model on online datacollected by planning with the learned model. To mitigate extrapolation errorsduring online interaction, we propose to regularize the planner at test-time bybalancing estimated returns and (epistemic) model uncertainty. We evaluate ourmethod on a variety of visuo-motor control tasks in simulation and on a realrobot, and find that our method enables few-shot finetuning to seen and unseentasks even when offline data is limited.

A Study in Length Generalization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16028v1</link><description>Large language models exhibit surprising emergent generalization properties,yet also struggle on many simple reasoning tasks such as arithmetic and parity.This raises the question of if and when Transformer models can learn the truealgorithm for solving a task. We study the scope of Transformers' abilities inthe specific setting of length generalization on algorithmic tasks. Here, wepropose a unifying framework to understand when and how Transformers canexhibit strong length generalization on a given task. Specifically, we leverageRASP (Weiss et al., 2021) -- a programming language designed for thecomputational model of a Transformer -- and introduce the RASP-GeneralizationConjecture: Transformers tend to length generalize on a task if the task can besolved by a short RASP program which works for all input lengths. This simpleconjecture remarkably captures most known instances of length generalization onalgorithmic tasks. Moreover, we leverage our insights to drastically improvegeneralization performance on traditionally hard tasks (such as parity andaddition). On the theoretical side, we give a simple example where the"min-degree-interpolator" model of learning from Abbe et al. (2023) does notcorrectly predict Transformers' out-of-distribution behavior, but ourconjecture does. Overall, our work provides a novel perspective on themechanisms of compositional generalization and the algorithmic capabilities ofTransformers.</description><author>Hattie Zhou, Arwen Bradley, Etai Littwin, Noam Razin, Omid Saremi, Josh Susskind, Samy Bengio, Preetum Nakkiran</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:43:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16028v1</guid></item><item><title>TimewarpVAE: Simultaneous Time-Warping and Representation Learning of Trajectories</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16027v1</link><description>Human demonstrations of trajectories are an important source of training datafor many machine learning problems. However, the difficulty of collecting humandemonstration data for complex tasks makes learning efficient representationsof those trajectories challenging. For many problems, such as for handwritingor for quasistatic dexterous manipulation, the exact timings of thetrajectories should be factored from their spatial path characteristics. Inthis work, we propose TimewarpVAE, a fully differentiable manifold-learningalgorithm that incorporates Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to simultaneously learnboth timing variations and latent factors of spatial variation. We show how theTimewarpVAE algorithm learns appropriate time alignments and meaningfulrepresentations of spatial variations in small handwriting and forkmanipulation datasets. Our results have lower spatial reconstruction test errorthan baseline approaches and the learned low-dimensional representations can beused to efficiently generate semantically meaningful novel trajectories.</description><author>Travers Rhodes, Daniel D.

Weformalize this problem as selecting a subset of a large raw unlabeled datasetto match a desired target distribution given some unlabeled target samples. Dueto the large scale and dimensionality of the raw text data, existing methodsuse simple heuristics or use experts to manually curate data. Instead, weextend the classic importance resampling approach used in low-dimensions for LMdata selection. We propose Data Selection with Importance Resampling (DSIR), anefficient and scalable framework that estimates importance weights in a reducedfeature space for tractability and selects data with importance resamplingaccording to these weights. To determine an appropriate feature space, we showthat KL reduction, a data metric that measures the proximity between selectedpretraining data and the target in a feature space, has high correlation withaverage downstream accuracy (r=0.89) when computed with simple n-gram features.This motivates our instantiation of DSIR using n-gram features. When performingcontinued pretraining towards a specific domain, DSIR performs comparably toexpert curation across 8 target distributions. When pretraining general-domainmodels (target is Wikipedia + books), DSIR improves over random selection andheuristic filtering baselines by 2-2.5% on the GLUE benchmark.</description><author>Sang Michael Xie, Shibani Santurkar, Tengyu Ma, Percy Liang</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:39:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03169v2</guid></item><item><title>ConvBKI: Real-Time Probabilistic Semantic Mapping Network with Quantifiable Uncertainty</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16020v1</link><description>In this paper, we develop a modular neural network for real-time semanticmapping in uncertain environments, which explicitly updates per-voxelprobabilistic distributions within a neural network layer.

Somepreliminary works use byte-level mutations or domain-specific filters (e.g.,foggy), whose enabled mutations may be limited and likely error-prone. SOTAworks employ deep generative models to generate (infinite) inputs. Also, tokeep the mutated inputs perceptually valid (e.g., a cat remains a "cat" aftermutation), existing efforts rely on imprecise and less generalizableheuristics. This study revisits two key objectives in media input mutation - perceptiondiversity (DIV) and validity (VAL) - in a rigorous manner based on manifold, awell-developed theory capturing perceptions of high-dimensional media data in alow-dimensional space. We show important results that DIV and VAL inextricablybound each other, and prove that SOTA generative model-based methodsfundamentally fail to mutate real-world media data (either sacrificing DIV orVAL). In contrast, we discuss the feasibility of mutating real-world media datawith provably high DIV and VAL based on manifold. We concretize the technical solution of mutating media data of variousformats (images, audios, text) via a unified manner based on manifold.Specifically, when media data are projected into a low-dimensional manifold,the data can be mutated by walking on the manifold with certain directions andstep sizes. When contrasted with the input data, the mutated data exhibitencouraging DIV in the perceptual traits (e.g., lying vs. standing dog) whileretaining reasonably high VAL (i.e., a dog remains a dog). We implement ourtechniques in DEEPWALK for testing DNNs. DEEPWALK outperforms prior methods intesting comprehensiveness and can find more error-triggering inputs with higherquality.</description><author>Yuanyuan Yuan, Qi Pang, Shuai Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:28:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01956v2</guid></item><item><title>Intelligent Debris Mass Estimation Model for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10617v2</link><description>Marine debris poses a significant threat to the survival of marine wildlife,often leading to entanglement and starvation, ultimately resulting in death.Therefore, removing debris from the ocean is crucial to restore the naturalbalance and allow marine life to thrive. Instance segmentation is an advancedform of object detection that identifies objects and precisely locates andseparates them, making it an essential tool for autonomous underwater vehicles(AUVs) to navigate and interact with their underwater environment effectively.AUVs use image segmentation to analyze images captured by their cameras tonavigate underwater environments. In this paper, we use instance segmentationto calculate the area of individual objects within an image, we use YOLOV7 inRoboflow to generate a set of bounding boxes for each object in the image witha class label and a confidence score for every detection. A segmentation maskis then created for each object by applying a binary mask to the object'sbounding box. The masks are generated by applying a binary threshold to theoutput of a convolutional neural network trained to segment objects from thebackground. Finally, refining the segmentation mask for each object is done byapplying post-processing techniques such as morphological operations andcontour detection, to improve the accuracy and quality of the mask. The processof estimating the area of instance segmentation involves calculating the areaof each segmented instance separately and then summing up the areas of allinstances to obtain the total area. The calculation is carried out usingstandard formulas based on the shape of the object, such as rectangles andcircles. In cases where the object is complex, the Monte Carlo method is usedto estimate the area. This method provides a higher degree of accuracy thantraditional methods, especially when using a large number of samples.</description><author>Mohana Sri S, Swethaa S, Aouthithiye Barathwaj SR Y, Sai Ganesh CS</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:23:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10617v2</guid></item><item><title>A mean-field games laboratory for generative modeling</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13534v5</link><description>We demonstrate the versatility of mean-field games (MFGs) as a mathematicalframework for explaining, enhancing, and designing generative models. Ingenerative flows, a Lagrangian formulation is used where each particle(generated sample) aims to minimize a loss function over its simulated path.The loss, however, is dependent on the paths of other particles, which leads toa competition among the population of particles. The asymptotic behavior ofthis competition yields a mean-field game. We establish connections betweenMFGs and major classes of generative flows and diffusions includingcontinuous-time normalizing flows, score-based generative models (SGM), andWasserstein gradient flows. Furthermore, we study the mathematical propertiesof each generative model by studying their associated MFG's optimalitycondition, which is a set of coupled forward-backward nonlinear partialdifferential equations. The mathematical structure described by the MFGoptimality conditions identifies the inductive biases of generative flows. Weinvestigate the well-posedness and structure of normalizing flows, unravel themathematical structure of SGMs, and derive a MFG formulation of Wassersteingradient flows. From an algorithmic perspective, the optimality conditionsyields Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) regularizers for enhanced training ofgenerative models. In particular, we propose and demonstrate an HJB-regularizedSGM with improved performance over standard SGMs. We present this framework asan MFG laboratory which serves as a platform for revealing new avenues ofexperimentation and invention of generative models.</description><author>Benjamin J.

Our framework invokeslow-level controllers - either learned or implicit in position-command control- to stabilize imitation around expert demonstrations. We show that with (a) asuitable low-level stability guarantee and (b) a powerful enough generativemodel as our imitation learner, pure supervised behavior cloning can generatetrajectories matching the per-time step distribution of essentially arbitraryexpert trajectories in an optimal transport cost. Our analysis relies on astochastic continuity property of the learned policy we call "total variationcontinuity" (TVC). We then show that TVC can be ensured with minimaldegradation of accuracy by combining a popular data-augmentation regimen with anovel algorithmic trick: adding augmentation noise at execution time. Weinstantiate our guarantees for policies parameterized by diffusion models andprove that if the learner accurately estimates the score of the(noise-augmented) expert policy, then the distribution of imitator trajectoriesis close to the demonstrator distribution in a natural optimal transportdistance. Our analysis constructs intricate couplings between noise-augmentedtrajectories, a technique that may be of independent interest. We conclude byempirically validating our algorithmic recommendations, and discussingimplications for future research directions for better behavior cloning withgenerative modeling.</description><author>Adam Block, Ali Jadbabaie, Daniel Pfrommer, Max Simchowitz, Russ Tedrake</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 18:16:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14619v5</guid></item><item><title>Human-in-the-Loop Task and Motion Planning for Imitation Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16014v1</link><description>Imitation learning from human demonstrations can teach robots complexmanipulation skills, but is time-consuming and labor intensive. In contrast,Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) systems are automated and excel at solvinglong-horizon tasks, but they are difficult to apply to contact-rich tasks. Inthis paper, we present Human-in-the-Loop Task and Motion Planning (HITL-TAMP),a novel system that leverages the benefits of both approaches.

We compared HITL-TAMP to a conventionalteleoperation system -- users gathered more than 3x the number of demos giventhe same time budget. Furthermore, proficient agents (75\%+ success) could betrained from just 10 minutes of non-expert teleoperation data. Finally, wecollected 2.1K demos with HITL-TAMP across 12 contact-rich, long-horizon tasksand show that the system often produces near-perfect agents.

To address this issue, we presentCOMET, an innovative hierarchical framework that leverages data consistenciesat all inherent levels in medical time series. Our meticulously designed modelsystematically captures data consistency from four potential levels:observation, sample, trial, and patient levels. By developing contrastive lossat multiple levels, we can learn effective representations that preservecomprehensive data consistency, maximizing information utilization in aself-supervised manner. We conduct experiments in the challengingpatient-independent setting. We compare COMET against six baselines using threediverse datasets, which include ECG signals for myocardial infarction and EEGsignals for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The results demonstrate thatCOMET consistently outperforms all baselines, particularly in setup with 10%and 1% labeled data fractions across all datasets.

However, RLHF may also encourage modelresponses that match user beliefs over truthful responses, a behavior known assycophancy. We investigate the prevalence of sycophancy in RLHF-trained modelsand whether human preference judgements are responsible. We first demonstratethat five state-of-the-art AI assistants consistently exhibit sycophanticbehavior across four varied free-form text-generation tasks. To understand ifhuman preferences drive this broadly observed behavior of RLHF models, weanalyze existing human preference data. We find that when a response matches auser's views, it is more likely to be preferred. Moreover, both humans andpreference models (PMs) prefer convincingly-written sycophantic responses overcorrect ones a non-negligible fraction of the time. Optimizing model outputsagainst PMs also sometimes sacrifices truthfulness in favor of sycophancy.Overall, our results indicate that sycophancy is a general behavior of RLHFmodels, likely driven in part by human preference judgements favoringsycophantic responses.</description><author>Mrinank Sharma, Meg Tong, Tomasz Korbak, David Duvenaud, Amanda Askell, Samuel R.

In the literature, fuzzing has beenextensively studied to uncover compiler defects. However, compiler fuzzingremains challenging: Existing arts focus on black- and grey-box fuzzing, whichgenerates tests without sufficient understanding of internal compilerbehaviors. As such, they often fail to construct programs to exerciseconditions of intricate optimizations. Meanwhile, traditional white-boxtechniques are computationally inapplicable to the giant codebase of compilers.Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in codegeneration/understanding tasks and have achieved state-of-the-art performancein black-box fuzzing. Nonetheless, prompting LLMs with compiler source-codeinformation remains a missing piece of research in compiler testing. To this end, we propose WhiteFox, the first white-box compiler fuzzer usingLLMs with source-code information to test compiler optimization. WhiteFoxadopts a dual-model framework: (i) an analysis LLM examines the low-leveloptimization source code and produces requirements on the high-level testprograms that can trigger the optimization; (ii) a generation LLM produces testprograms based on the summarized requirements. Additionally,optimization-triggering tests are used as feedback to further enhance the testgeneration on the fly. Our evaluation on four popular compilers shows thatWhiteFox can generate high-quality tests to exercise deep optimizationsrequiring intricate conditions, practicing up to 80 more optimizations thanstate-of-the-art fuzzers. To date, WhiteFox has found in total 96 bugs, with 80confirmed as previously unknown and 51 already fixed. Beyond compiler testing,WhiteFox can also be adapted for white-box fuzzing of other complex, real-worldsoftware systems in general.</description><author>Chenyuan Yang, Yinlin Deng, Runyu Lu, Jiayi Yao, Jiawei Liu, Reyhaneh Jabbarvand, Lingming Zhang</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 17:39:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15991v1</guid></item><item><title>Quantification of Uncertainty with Adversarial Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03217v2</link><description>Quantifying uncertainty is important for actionable predictions in real-worldapplications.

Current methods suchas Deep Ensembles or MC dropout underperform at estimating the epistemicuncertainty, since they primarily consider the posterior when sampling models.We suggest Quantification of Uncertainty with Adversarial Models (QUAM) tobetter estimate the epistemic uncertainty. QUAM identifies regions where thewhole product under the integral is large, not just the posterior.Consequently, QUAM has lower approximation error of the epistemic uncertaintycompared to previous methods. Models for which the product is large correspondto adversarial models (not adversarial examples!).

This is in contrast with standardmulti-class image classification, where the task is predicting a single labelfrom many possible labels for an image. Single-Positive Multi-label Learning(SPML) specifically considers learning to predict multiple labels when there isonly a single annotation per image in the training data. Multi-label learningis in many ways a more realistic task than single-label learning as real-worlddata often involves instances belonging to multiple categories simultaneously;however, most common computer vision datasets predominantly contain singlelabels due to the inherent complexity and cost of collecting multiple highquality annotations for each instance.

Usually, DDHs are displayed as 2Drendered animation videos and it is natural to adapt video quality assessment(VQA) methods to DDH quality assessment (DDH-QA) tasks. However, the VQAmethods are highly dependent on viewpoints and less sensitive to geometry-baseddistortions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel no-reference (NR)geometry-aware video quality assessment method for DDH-QA challenge. Geometrycharacteristics are described by the statistical parameters estimated from theDDHs' geometry attribute distributions. Spatial and temporal features areacquired from the rendered videos. Finally, all kinds of features areintegrated and regressed into quality values. Experimental results show thatthe proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DDH-QAdatabase.</description><author>Zicheng Zhang, Yingjie Zhou, Wei Sun, Xiongkuo Min, Guangtao Zhai</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 17:34:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15984v1</guid></item><item><title>NA-SODINN: a deep learning algorithm for exoplanet image detection based on residual noise regimes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02854v2</link><description>Supervised deep learning was recently introduced in high-contrast imaging(HCI) through the SODINN algorithm, a convolutional neural network designed forexoplanet detection in angular differential imaging (ADI) datasets. Thebenchmarking of HCI algorithms within the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge(EIDC) showed that (i) SODINN can produce a high number of false positives inthe final detection maps, and (ii) algorithms processing images in a more localmanner perform better. This work aims to improve the SODINN detectionperformance by introducing new local processing approaches and adapting itslearning process accordingly. We propose NA-SODINN, a new deep learning binaryclassifier based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that better capturesimage noise correlations in ADI-processed frames by identifying noise regimes.Our new approach was tested against its predecessor, as well as twoSODINN-based hybrid models and a more standard annular-PCA approach, throughlocal receiving operating characteristics (ROC) analysis of ADI sequences fromthe VLT/SPHERE and Keck/NIRC-2 instruments. Results show that NA-SODINNenhances SODINN in both sensitivity and specificity, especially in thespeckle-dominated noise regime. NA-SODINN is also benchmarked against thecomplete set of submitted detection algorithms in EIDC, in which we show thatits final detection score matches or outperforms the most powerful detectionalgorithms.Throughout the supervised machine learning case, this studyillustrates and reinforces the importance of adapting the task of detection tothe local content of processed images.</description><author>Carles Cantero, Olivier Absil, Carl-Henrik Dahlqvist, Marc Van Droogenbroeck</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 17:32:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02854v2</guid></item><item><title>RADAR: Robust AI-Text Detection via Adversarial Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03838v2</link><description>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and the intensifyingpopularity of ChatGPT-like applications have blurred the boundary ofhigh-quality text generation between humans and machines. However, in additionto the anticipated revolutionary changes to our technology and society, thedifficulty of distinguishing LLM-generated texts (AI-text) from human-generatedtexts poses new challenges of misuse and fairness, such as fake contentgeneration, plagiarism, and false accusations of innocent writers. Whileexisting works show that current AI-text detectors are not robust to LLM-basedparaphrasing, this paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing a new frameworkcalled RADAR, which jointly trains a robust AI-text detector via adversariallearning. RADAR is based on adversarial training of a paraphraser and adetector. The paraphraser's goal is to generate realistic content to evadeAI-text detection. RADAR uses the feedback from the detector to update theparaphraser, and vice versa. Evaluated with 8 different LLMs (Pythia, Dolly2.0, Palmyra, Camel, GPT-J, Dolly 1.0, LLaMA, and Vicuna) across 4 datasets,experimental results show that RADAR significantly outperforms existing AI-textdetection methods, especially when paraphrasing is in place. We also identifythe strong transferability of RADAR from instruction-tuned LLMs to other LLMs,and evaluate the improved capability of RADAR via GPT-3.5-Turbo.</description><author>Xiaomeng Hu, Pin-Yu Chen, Tsung-Yi Ho</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 17:31:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03838v2</guid></item><item><title>Graph Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15978v1</link><description>Graph-based deep learning methods have become popular tools to processcollections of correlated time series. Differently from traditionalmultivariate forecasting methods, neural graph-based predictors take advantageof pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on a (possibly dynamic)graph spanning the time series collection. The conditioning can take the formof an architectural inductive bias on the neural forecasting architecture,resulting in a family of deep learning models called spatiotemporal graphneural networks. Such relational inductive biases enable the training of globalforecasting models on large time-series collections, while at the same timelocalizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (i.e., graph nodes) byaccounting for local correlations among them (i.e., graph edges). Indeed,recent theoretical and practical advances in graph neural networks and deeplearning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processingframeworks appealing and timely. However, most of the studies in the literaturefocus on proposing variations of existing neural architectures by takingadvantage of modern deep learning practices, while foundational andmethodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. Tofill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodologicalframework that formalizes the forecasting problem and provides designprinciples for graph-based predictive models and methods to assess theirperformance.

Yet, existing analyses of signSGD rely on assuming that data aresampled with replacement in each iteration, contradicting the practicalimplementation where data are randomly reshuffled and sequentially fed into thealgorithm. We bridge this gap by proving the first convergence result ofsignSGD with random reshuffling (SignRR) for nonconvex optimization. Given thedataset size $n$, the number of epochs of data passes $T$, and the variancebound of a stochastic gradient $\sigma^2$, we show that SignRR has the sameconvergence rate $O(\log(nT)/\sqrt{nT} + \|\sigma\|_1)$ as signSGD\citep{bernstein2018signsgd}. We then present SignRVR and SignRVM, whichleverage variance-reduced gradients and momentum updates respectively, bothconverging at $O(\log(nT)/\sqrt{nT})$. In contrast with the analysis ofsignSGD, our results do not require an extremely large batch size in eachiteration to be of the same order as the total number of iterations\citep{bernstein2018signsgd} or the signs of stochastic and true gradientsmatch element-wise with a minimum probability of 1/2\citep{safaryan2021stochastic}. We also extend our algorithms to cases wheredata are distributed across different machines, yielding dist-SignRVR anddist-SignRVM, both converging at $O(\log(n_0T)/\sqrt{n_0T})$, where $n_0$ isthe dataset size of a single machine. We back up our theoretical findingsthrough experiments on simulated and real-world problems, verifying thatrandomly reshuffled sign methods match or surpass existing baselines.</description><author>Zhen Qin, Zhishuai Liu, Pan Xu</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 17:25:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15976v1</guid></item><item><title>Nonlinear model reduction for slow-fast stochastic systems near unknown invariant manifolds</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02120v2</link><description>We introduce a nonlinear stochastic model reduction technique forhigh-dimensional stochastic dynamical systems that have a low-dimensionalinvariant effective manifold with slow dynamics, and high-dimensional, largefast modes. Given only access to a black box simulator from which short burstsof simulation can be obtained, we design an algorithm that outputs an estimateof the invariant manifold, a process of the effective stochastic dynamics onit, which has averaged out the fast modes, and a simulator thereof. Thissimulator is efficient in that it exploits of the low dimension of theinvariant manifold, and takes time steps of size dependent on the regularity ofthe effective process, and therefore typically much larger than that of theoriginal simulator, which had to resolve the fast modes. The algorithm and theestimation can be performed on-the-fly, leading to efficient exploration of theeffective state space, without losing consistency with the underlying dynamics.This construction enables fast and efficient simulation of paths of theeffective dynamics, together with estimation of crucial features andobservables of such dynamics, including the stationary distribution,identification of metastable states, and residence times and transition ratesbetween them.</description><author>Felix X. -F.

To address thisissue, researchers have proposed multiplication-free neural networks, such asPower-of-Two quantization, or also known as Shift networks, which aim to reducememory usage and simplify computation. However, existing low-bit Shift networksare not as accurate as their full-precision counterparts, typically sufferingfrom limited weight range encoding schemes and quantization loss. In thispaper, we propose the DenseShift network, which significantly improves theaccuracy of Shift networks, achieving competitive performance to full-precisionnetworks for vision and speech applications. In addition, we introduce a methodto deploy an efficient DenseShift network using non-quantized floating-pointactivations, while obtaining 1.6X speed-up over existing methods. To achievethis, we demonstrate that zero-weight values in low-bit Shift networks do notcontribute to model capacity and negatively impact inference computation. Toaddress this issue, we propose a zero-free shifting mechanism that simplifiesinference and increases model capacity. We further propose a sign-scaledecomposition design to enhance training efficiency and a low-variance randominitialization strategy to improve the model's transfer learning performance.Our extensive experiments on various computer vision and speech tasksdemonstrate that DenseShift outperforms existing low-bit multiplication-freenetworks and achieves competitive performance compared to full-precisionnetworks.

However, their vulnerability to noisy input poses asignificant challenge in practical implementation, where generating cleanoutput from noisy input is crucial. The MTNT dataset is widely used as abenchmark for evaluating the robustness of NMT models against noisy input.Nevertheless, its utility is limited due to the presence of noise in both thesource and target sentences. To address this limitation, we focus on cleaningthe noise from the target sentences in MTNT, making it more suitable as abenchmark for noise evaluation. Leveraging the capabilities of large languagemodels (LLMs), we observe their impressive abilities in noise removal. Forexample, they can remove emojis while considering their semantic meaning.Additionally, we show that LLM can effectively rephrase slang, jargon, andprofanities. The resulting datasets, called C-MTNT, exhibit significantly lessnoise in the target sentences while preserving the semantic integrity of theoriginal sentences. Our human and GPT-4 evaluations also lead to a consistentconclusion that LLM performs well on this task. Lastly, experiments on C-MTNTshowcased its effectiveness in evaluating the robustness of NMT models,highlighting the potential of advanced language models for data cleaning andemphasizing C-MTNT as a valuable resource.</description><author>Quinten Bolding, Baohao Liao, Brandon James Denis, Jun Luo, Christof Monz</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 17:14:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13469v3</guid></item><item><title>Accented Speech Recognition With Accent-specific Codebooks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15970v1</link><description>Speech accents pose a significant challenge to state-of-the-art automaticspeech recognition (ASR) systems.

The key strategy of thesemodels is to, for each processed token, activate at most a few experts -subsets of an extensive feed-forward layer. But this approach is not withoutits challenges. The operation of matching experts and tokens is discrete, whichmakes MoE models prone to issues like training instability and uneven expertutilization. Existing techniques designed to address these concerns, such asauxiliary losses or balance-aware matching, result either in lower modelperformance or are more difficult to train. In response to these issues, wepropose Mixture of Tokens, a fully-differentiable model that retains thebenefits of MoE architectures while avoiding the aforementioned difficulties.Rather than routing tokens to experts, this approach mixes tokens fromdifferent examples prior to feeding them to experts, enabling the model tolearn from all token-expert combinations. Importantly, this mixing can bedisabled to avoid mixing of different sequences during inference.

Despite the high accuracy, they are often criticizedfor lacking explainability. There has been an increasing demand forunderstanding the decision-making process of deep face recognition systems.Recent studies have investigated the usage of visual saliency maps as anexplanation, but they often lack a discussion and analysis in the context offace recognition. This paper concentrates on explainable face verificationtasks and conceives a new explanation framework. Firstly, a definition of thesaliency-based explanation method is provided, which focuses on the decisionsmade by the deep FR model. Secondly, a new model-agnostic explanation methodnamed CorrRISE is proposed to produce saliency maps, which reveal both thesimilar and dissimilar regions of any given pair of face images. Then, anevaluation methodology is designed to measure the performance of general visualsaliency explanation methods in face verification. Finally, substantial visualand quantitative results have shown that the proposed CorrRISE methoddemonstrates promising results in comparison with other state-of-the-artexplainable face verification approaches.</description><author>Yuhang Lu, Zewei Xu, Touradj Ebrahimi</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 17:02:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08546v4</guid></item><item><title>PuoBERTa: Training and evaluation of a curated language model for Setswana</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09141v2</link><description>Natural language processing (NLP) has made significant progress forwell-resourced languages such as English but lagged behind for low-resourcelanguages like Setswana.

In this paper, we propose a new training paradigm andformulate the parameter learning of ConvNets into a prediction task: given aConvNet architecture, we observe there exists correlations between imagedatasets and their corresponding optimal network parameters, and explore if wecan learn a hyper-mapping between them to capture the relations, such that wecan directly predict the parameters of the network for an image dataset neverseen during the training phase. To do this, we put forward a new hypernetworkbased model, called PudNet, which intends to learn a mapping between datasetsand their corresponding network parameters, and then predicts parameters forunseen data with only a single forward propagation. Moreover, our modelbenefits from a series of adaptive hyper recurrent units sharing weights tocapture the dependencies of parameters among different network layers.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves goodefficacy for unseen image datasets on two kinds of settings: Intra-datasetprediction and Inter-dataset prediction.

This limitation hinders the effectiveness of decodingmethods in achieving high levels of controllability. To address this problem,we propose a novel lightweight decoding framework named Air-Decoding.

We observethat different regions of interest in the visual feature map are suitable forperforming query classification and box localization tasks, even for the sameobject. Salient regions provide vital information for classification, while theboundaries around them are more favorable for box regression. Unfortunately,such spatial misalignment between these two tasks greatly hinders DETR'straining. Therefore, in this work, we focus on decoupling localization andclassification tasks in DETR. To achieve this, we introduce a new design schemecalled spatially decoupled DETR (SD-DETR), which includes a task-aware querygeneration module and a disentangled feature learning process. We elaboratelydesign the task-aware query initialization process and divide thecross-attention block in the decoder to allow the task-aware queries to matchdifferent visual regions. Meanwhile, we also observe that the predictionmisalignment problem for high classification confidence and preciselocalization exists, so we propose an alignment loss to further guide thespatially decoupled DETR training. Through extensive experiments, wedemonstrate that our approach achieves a significant improvement in MSCOCOdatasets compared to previous work. For instance, we improve the performance ofConditional DETR by 4.5 AP.

In thispaper, we introduce a novel three-stage approach based on transformers coupledwith conditional diffusion models, with the goal of improving model robustnessto the kinds of imaging variability commonly encountered in practice withoutthe need for pre-determined data augmentation strategies. To this end, multipleimage encoders first learn hierarchical feature representations to builddiscriminative latent spaces. Next, a reverse diffusion process, guided by thelatent code, acts on an informative prior and proposes prediction candidates ina generative manner. Finally, several prediction candidates are aggregated in abi-level aggregation protocol to produce the final output. Through extensiveexperiments on medical imaging benchmark datasets, we show that our methodimproves upon state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and confidencecalibration. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to quantify the predictionuncertainty at the instance level, increasing their trustworthiness toclinicians using them in clinical practice.</description><author>Xing Shen, Hengguan Huang, Brennan Nichyporuk, Tal Arbel</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 16:53:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15952v1</guid></item><item><title>Weighted Distance Nearest Neighbor Condensing</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15951v1</link><description>The problem of nearest neighbor condensing has enjoyed a long history ofstudy, both in its theoretical and practical aspects.

However, these graph-based recommenders heavily dependon ID-based data, potentially disregarding valuable textual informationassociated with users and items, resulting in less informative learnedrepresentations. Moreover, the utilization of implicit feedback data introducespotential noise and bias, posing challenges for the effectiveness of userpreference learning. While the integration of large language models (LLMs) intotraditional ID-based recommenders has gained attention, challenges such asscalability issues, limitations in text-only reliance, and prompt inputconstraints need to be addressed for effective implementation in practicalrecommender systems. To address these challenges, we propose a model-agnosticframework RLMRec that aims to enhance existing recommenders with LLM-empoweredrepresentation learning. It proposes a recommendation paradigm that integratesrepresentation learning with LLMs to capture intricate semantic aspects of userbehaviors and preferences. RLMRec incorporates auxiliary textual signals,develops a user/item profiling paradigm empowered by LLMs, and aligns thesemantic space of LLMs with the representation space of collaborativerelational signals through a cross-view alignment framework. This work furtherestablish a theoretical foundation demonstrating that incorporating textualsignals through mutual information maximization enhances the quality ofrepresentations. In our evaluation, we integrate RLMRec with state-of-the-artrecommender models, while also analyzing its efficiency and robustness to noisedata.

Recently, substantial efforts have been directed to synthesizethe scene using human motions, room layouts, or spatial graphs as the input.However, few studies have addressed this problem from multiple modalities,especially combining text prompts. In this paper, we propose a language-drivenscene synthesis task, which is a new task that integrates text prompts, humanmotion, and existing objects for scene synthesis. Unlike other single-conditionsynthesis tasks, our problem involves multiple conditions and requires astrategy for processing and encoding them into a unified space. To address thechallenge, we present a multi-conditional diffusion model, which differs fromthe implicit unification approach of other diffusion literature by explicitlypredicting the guiding points for the original data distribution. Wedemonstrate that our approach is theoretically supportive. The intensiveexperiment results illustrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-artbenchmarks and enables natural scene editing applications.

In audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE), there is not as muchground-truth clean data available; most audio-visual datasets are collected inreal-world environments with background noise and reverberation, hampering thedevelopment of AVSE. In this work, we introduce AV2Wav, a resynthesis-basedaudio-visual speech enhancement approach that can generate clean speech despitethe challenges of real-world training data. We obtain a subset of nearly cleanspeech from an audio-visual corpus using a neural quality estimator, and thentrain a diffusion model on this subset to generate waveforms conditioned oncontinuous speech representations from AV-HuBERT with noise-robust training. Weuse continuous rather than discrete representations to retain prosody andspeaker information. With this vocoding task alone, the model can performspeech enhancement better than a masking-based baseline. We further fine-tunethe diffusion model on clean/noisy utterance pairs to improve the performance.Our approach outperforms a masking-based baseline in terms of both automaticmetrics and a human listening test and is close in quality to the target speechin the listening test.

OK transfers knowledge by adaptivelycombining subsets of known behaviors using Successor Features (SFs) andGeneralized Policy Improvement (GPI). However, it relies on hand-designedstate-features and task encodings which are cumbersome to design for every newenvironment. In this work, we propose the "Successor Features Keyboard" (SFK),which enables transfer with discovered state-features and task encodings. Toenable discovery, we propose the "Categorical Successor Feature Approximator"(CSFA), a novel learning algorithm for estimating SFs while jointly discoveringstate-features and task encodings. With SFK and CSFA, we achieve the firstdemonstration of transfer with SFs in a challenging 3D environment where allthe necessary representations are discovered. We first compare CSFA againstother methods for approximating SFs and show that only CSFA discoversrepresentations compatible with SF&amp;GPI at this scale. We then compare SFKagainst transfer learning baselines and show that it transfers most quickly tolong-horizon tasks.</description><author>Wilka Carvalho, Andre Saraiva, Angelos Filos, Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Loic Matthey, Richard L.

Recently, the emergenceof Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, ChatGPT and GPT-4, hasattracted wide attention from the computational linguistics community. However,it is not yet known the performance of LLMs on CLS. In this report, weempirically use various prompts to guide LLMs to perform zero-shot CLS fromdifferent paradigms (i.e., end-to-end and pipeline), and provide a preliminaryevaluation on the generated summaries. We find that ChatGPT and GPT-4originally prefer to produce lengthy summaries with detailed information. Thesetwo LLMs can further balance informativeness and conciseness with the help ofan interactive prompt, significantly improving their CLS performance.Experimental results on three widely-used CLS datasets show that GPT-4 achievesstate-of-the-art zero-shot CLS performance, and performs competitively comparedwith the fine-tuned mBART-50. Moreover, we also find some multi-lingual andbilingual LLMs (i.e., BLOOMZ, ChatGLM-6B, Vicuna-13B and ChatYuan) have limitedzero-shot CLS ability. Due to the composite nature of CLS, which requiresmodels to perform summarization and translation simultaneously, accomplishingthis task in a zero-shot manner is even a challenge for LLMs. Therefore, wesincerely hope and recommend future LLM research could use CLS as a testbed.</description><author>Jiaan Wang, Yunlong Liang, Fandong Meng, Beiqi Zou, Zhixu Li, Jianfeng Qu, Jie Zhou</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 16:34:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14229v4</guid></item><item><title>ABKD: Graph Neural Network Compression with Attention-Based Knowledge Distillation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15938v1</link><description>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be quite versatile for a varietyof applications, including recommendation systems, fake news detection, drugdiscovery, and even computer vision. Due to the expanding size ofgraph-structured data, GNN models have also increased in complexity, leading tosubstantial latency issues. This is primarily attributed to the irregularstructure of graph data and its access pattern into memory. The naturalsolution to reduce latency is to compress large GNNs into small GNNs. One wayto do this is via knowledge distillation (KD). However, most KD approaches forGNNs only consider the outputs of the last layers and do not consider theoutputs of the intermediate layers of the GNNs; these layers may containimportant inductive biases indicated by the graph structure. To address thisshortcoming, we propose a novel KD approach to GNN compression that we callAttention-Based Knowledge Distillation (ABKD). ABKD is a KD approach that usesattention to identify important intermediate teacher-student layer pairs andfocuses on aligning their outputs. ABKD enables higher compression of GNNs witha smaller accuracy dropoff compared to existing KD approaches. On average, weachieve a 1.79% increase in accuracy with a 32.3x compression ratio onOGBN-Mag, a large graph dataset, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description><author>Anshul Ahluwalia, Rohit Das, Payman Behnam, Alind Khare, Pan Li, Alexey Tumanov</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 16:34:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15938v1</guid></item><item><title>Improving Fairness in Deepfake Detection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16635v2</link><description>Despite the development of effective deepfake detection models in recentyears, several recent studies have demonstrated that biases in the trainingdata utilized to develop deepfake detection models can lead to unfairperformance for demographic groups of different races and/or genders.

While these studies have focused on identifying and evaluatingthe unfairness in deepfake detection, no methods have been developed to addressthe fairness issue of deepfake detection at the algorithm level. In this work,we make the first attempt to improve deepfake detection fairness by proposingnovel loss functions to train fair deepfake detection models in ways that areagnostic or aware of demographic factors.

Specifically, we consider a scenario where $n$ sensors are measuringsome common, ongoing phenomenon. At each time step $t=1,2,\ldots,T$, the$i^{th}$ sensor reports its readings $x^{(i)}_t$ for that time step. Thealgorithm must then commit to its estimate $\mu_t$ for the true mean value ofthe process at time $t$. We assume that most of the sensors observe independentsamples from some common distribution $X$, but an $\epsilon$-fraction of themmay instead behave maliciously. The algorithm wishes to compute a goodapproximation $\mu$ to the true mean $\mu^\ast := \mathbf{E}[X]$. We note thatif the algorithm is allowed to wait until time $T$ to report its estimate, thisreduces to the well-studied problem of robust mean estimation. However, therequirement that our algorithm produces partial estimates as the data is comingin substantially complicates the situation. We prove two main results about online robust mean estimation in this model.First, if the uncorrupted samples satisfy the standard condition of$(\epsilon,\delta)$-stability, we give an efficient online algorithm thatoutputs estimates $\mu_t$, $t \in [T],$ such that with high probability itholds that $\|\mu-\mu^\ast\|_2 = O(\delta \log(T))$, where $\mu = (\mu_t)_{t\in [T]}$. We note that this error bound is nearly competitive with the bestoffline algorithms, which would achieve $\ell_2$-error of $O(\delta)$. Oursecond main result shows that with additional assumptions on the input (mostnotably that $X$ is a product distribution) there are inefficient algorithmswhose error does not depend on $T$ at all.</description><author>Daniel M.

In particular, it is challenging to map it to the "standard"machine learning framework, where one uses a training set $S$ to find abest-fitting function $f(x)$ in some hypothesis class. Here we make progress onthis problem by showing that the functions learned by ICL often have a verysimple structure: they correspond to the transformer LLM whose only inputs arethe query $x$ and a single "task vector" calculated from the training set.Thus, ICL can be seen as compressing $S$ into a single task vector$\boldsymbol{\theta}(S)$ and then using this task vector to modulate thetransformer to produce the output.

We also provide computational results to show thestatistically significant advantages of the proposed MLT approach.

As of 2021,approximately 828 million people worldwide are experiencing hunger andmalnutrition, with numerous fatalities reported. Climate change significantlyimpacts agricultural land suitability, potentially leading to severe foodshortages and subsequent social and political conflicts. To address thispressing issue, we have developed a machine learning-based approach to predictthe risk of substantial land suitability degradation and changes in irrigationpatterns. Our study focuses on Central Eurasia, a region burdened with economicand social challenges. This study represents a pioneering effort in utilizing machine learningmethods to assess the impact of climate change on agricultural land suitabilityunder various carbon emissions scenarios. Through comprehensive featureimportance analysis, we unveil specific climate and terrain characteristicsthat exert influence on land suitability. Our approach achieves remarkableaccuracy, offering policymakers invaluable insights to facilitate informeddecisions aimed at averting a humanitarian crisis, including strategies such asthe provision of additional water and fertilizers.

These twosources can disagree, causing competition within the model, and it is unclearhow an LM will resolve the conflict. On a dataset that queries for knowledge ofworld capitals, we investigate both distributional and mechanistic determinantsof LM behavior in such situations. Specifically, we measure the proportion ofthe time an LM will use a counterfactual prefix (e.g., "The capital of Polandis London") to overwrite what it learned in pretraining ("Warsaw"). On Pythiaand GPT2, the training frequency of both the query country ("Poland") and thein-context city ("London") highly affect the models' likelihood of using thecounterfactual. We then use head attribution to identify individual attentionheads that either promote the memorized answer or the in-context answer in thelogits. By scaling up or down the value vector of these heads, we can controlthe likelihood of using the in-context answer on new data. This method canincrease the rate of generating the in-context answer to 88\% of the timesimply by scaling a single head at runtime. Our work contributes to a body ofevidence showing that we can often localize model behaviors to specificcomponents and provides a proof of concept for how future methods might controlmodel behavior dynamically at runtime.</description><author>Qinan Yu, Jack Merullo, Ellie Pavlick</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 16:15:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15910v1</guid></item><item><title>Is Probing All You Need? Indicator Tasks as an Alternative to Probing Embedding Spaces</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15905v1</link><description>The ability to identify and control different kinds of linguistic informationencoded in vector representations of words has many use cases, especially forexplainability and bias removal. This is usually done via a set of simpleclassification tasks, termed probes, to evaluate the information encoded in theembedding space. However, the involvement of a trainable classifier leads toentanglement between the probe's results and the classifier's nature. As aresult, contemporary works on probing include tasks that do not involvetraining of auxiliary models. In this work we introduce the term indicatortasks for non-trainable tasks which are used to query embedding spaces for theexistence of certain properties, and claim that this kind of tasks may point toa direction opposite to probes, and that this contradiction complicates thedecision on whether a property exists in an embedding space. We demonstrate ourclaims with two test cases, one dealing with gender debiasing and another withthe erasure of morphological information from embedding spaces. We show thatthe application of a suitable indicator provides a more accurate picture of theinformation captured and removed compared to probes. We thus conclude thatindicator tasks should be implemented and taken into consideration wheneliciting information from embedded representations.</description><author>Tal Levy, Omer Goldman, Reut Tsarfaty</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 16:08:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15905v1</guid></item><item><title>SCL-RAI: Span-based Contrastive Learning with Retrieval Augmented Inference for Unlabeled Entity Problem in NER</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01646v3</link><description>Named Entity Recognition is the task to locate and classify the entities inthe text.

Improving Neural Detection of Synthetic Text via Emotion Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15904v1</link><description>Recent developments in generative AI have shone a spotlight onhigh-performance synthetic text generation technologies. The now wideavailability and ease of use of such models highlights the urgent need toprovide equally powerful technologies capable of identifying synthetic text.With this in mind, we draw inspiration from psychological studies which suggestthat people can be driven by emotion and encode emotion in the text theycompose. We hypothesize that pretrained language models (PLMs) have anaffective deficit because they lack such an emotional driver when generatingtext and consequently may generate synthetic text which has affectiveincoherence i.e. lacking the kind of emotional coherence present inhuman-authored text. We subsequently develop an emotionally aware detector byfine-tuning a PLM on emotion. Experiment results indicate that ouremotionally-aware detector achieves improvements across a range of synthetictext generators, various sized models, datasets, and domains. Finally, wecompare our emotionally-aware synthetic text detector to ChatGPT in the task ofidentification of its own output and show substantial gains, reinforcing thepotential of emotion as a signal to identify synthetic text.

Previous works have been restrictedto the multi-class classification setting and discovered a prevalent NCphenomenon comprising of the following properties for the last-layer features:(i) the variability of features within every class collapses to zero, (ii) theset of feature means form an equi-angular tight frame (ETF), and (iii) the lastlayer classifiers collapse to the feature mean upon some scaling. We generalizethe study to multi-label learning, and prove for the first time that ageneralized NC phenomenon holds with the "pick-all-label'' formulation. Underthe natural analog of the unconstrained feature model (UFM), we establish thatthe only global classifier of the pick-all-label cross entropy loss display thesame ETF geometry which further collapse to multiplicity-1 feature class means.Besides, we discover a combinatorial property in generalized NC which is uniquefor multi-label learning that we call ``tag-wise average'' property, where thefeature class-means of samples with multiple labels are scaled average of thefeature class-means of single label tags. Theoretically, we establish globaloptimality result for the pick-all-label cross-entropy risk for the UFM.Additionally, We also provide empirical evidence to support our investigationinto training deep neural networks on multi-label datasets, resulting inimproved training efficiency.</description><author>Pengyu Li, Yutong Wang, Xiao Li, Qing Qu</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 16:07:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15903v1</guid></item><item><title>YOLO-Angio: An Algorithm for Coronary Anatomy Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15898v1</link><description>Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosis of coronaryartery disease, the most common cause of death worldwide.

However, trainingmodels typically requires expensive and time-consuming collection of largequantities of labeled data. This is particularly true within the scope ofmedical imaging analysis (MIA), where data are limited and labels are expensiveto be acquired. Thus, label-efficient deep learning methods are developed tomake comprehensive use of the labeled data as well as the abundance ofunlabeled and weak-labeled data. In this survey, we extensively investigatedover 300 recent papers to provide a comprehensive overview of recent progresson label-efficient learning strategies in MIA. We first present the backgroundof label-efficient learning and categorize the approaches into differentschemes. Next, we examine the current state-of-the-art methods in detailthrough each scheme. Specifically, we provide an in-depth investigation,covering not only canonical semi-supervised, self-supervised, andmulti-instance learning schemes, but also recently emerged active andannotation-efficient learning strategies. Moreover, as a comprehensivecontribution to the field, this survey not only elucidates the commonalitiesand unique features of the surveyed methods but also presents a detailedanalysis of the current challenges in the field and suggests potential avenuesfor future research.</description><author>Cheng Jin, Zhengrui Guo, Yi Lin, Luyang Luo, Hao Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 16:01:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12484v2</guid></item><item><title>AnglE-optimized Text Embeddings</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12871v5</link><description>High-quality text embedding is pivotal in improving semantic textualsimilarity (STS) tasks, which are crucial components in Large Language Model(LLM) applications. However, a common challenge existing text embedding modelsface is the problem of vanishing gradients, primarily due to their reliance onthe cosine function in the optimization objective, which has saturation zones.To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel angle-optimized textembedding model called AnglE. The core idea of AnglE is to introduce angleoptimization in a complex space. This novel approach effectively mitigates theadverse effects of the saturation zone in the cosine function, which can impedegradient and hinder optimization processes. To set up a comprehensive STSevaluation, we experimented on existing short-text STS datasets and a newlycollected long-text STS dataset from GitHub Issues. Furthermore, we examinedomain-specific STS scenarios with limited labeled data and explore how AnglEworks with LLM-annotated data. Extensive experiments were conducted on varioustasks including short-text STS, long-text STS, and domain-specific STS tasks.The results show that AnglE outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) STS modelsthat ignore the cosine saturation zone. These findings demonstrate the abilityof AnglE to generate high-quality text embeddings and the usefulness of angleoptimization in STS.</description><author>Xianming Li, Jing Li</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 15:59:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12871v5</guid></item><item><title>Overview of ImageArg-2023: The First Shared Task in Multimodal Argument Mining</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12172v2</link><description>This paper presents an overview of the ImageArg shared task, the firstmultimodal Argument Mining shared task co-located with the 10th Workshop onArgument Mining at EMNLP 2023.

A Preliminary Study</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04048v3</link><description>Recently, the emergence of ChatGPT has attracted wide attention from thecomputational linguistics community. Many prior studies have shown that ChatGPTachieves remarkable performance on various NLP tasks in terms of automaticevaluation metrics. However, the ability of ChatGPT to serve as an evaluationmetric is still underexplored. Considering assessing the quality of naturallanguage generation (NLG) models is an arduous task and NLG metrics notoriouslyshow their poor correlation with human judgments, we wonder whether ChatGPT isa good NLG evaluation metric. In this report, we provide a preliminarymeta-evaluation on ChatGPT to show its reliability as an NLG metric. In detail,we regard ChatGPT as a human evaluator and give task-specific (e.g.,summarization) and aspect-specific (e.g., relevance) instruction to promptChatGPT to evaluate the generated results of NLG models. We conduct experimentson five NLG meta-evaluation datasets (including summarization, story generationand data-to-text tasks). Experimental results show that compared with previousautomatic metrics, ChatGPT achieves state-of-the-art or competitive correlationwith human judgments in most cases. In addition, we find that the effectivenessof the ChatGPT evaluator might be influenced by the creation method of themeta-evaluation datasets. For the meta-evaluation datasets which are createdgreatly depending on the reference and thus are biased, the ChatGPT evaluatormight lose its effectiveness. We hope our preliminary study could prompt theemergence of a general-purposed reliable NLG metric.</description><author>Jiaan Wang, Yunlong Liang, Fandong Meng, Zengkui Sun, Haoxiang Shi, Zhixu Li, Jinan Xu, Jianfeng Qu, Jie Zhou</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 15:56:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04048v3</guid></item><item><title>nanoT5: A PyTorch Framework for Pre-training and Fine-tuning T5-style Models with Limited Resources</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02373v2</link><description>State-of-the-art language models like T5 have revolutionized the NLPlandscape, but their computational demands hinder a large portion of theresearch community.

Existingresearch explores the application of representation learning for data-efficientRL, e.g., learning predictive representations by predicting long-term futurestates. However, many existing methods do not fully exploit the structuralinformation inherent in sequential state signals, which can potentially improvethe quality of long-term decision-making but is difficult to discern in thetime domain. To tackle this problem, we propose State Sequences Prediction viaFourier Transform (SPF), a novel method that exploits the frequency domain ofstate sequences to extract the underlying patterns in time series data forlearning expressive representations efficiently. Specifically, we theoreticallyanalyze the existence of structural information in state sequences, which isclosely related to policy performance and signal regularity, and then proposeto predict the Fourier transform of infinite-step future state sequences toextract such information. One of the appealing features of SPF is that it issimple to implement while not requiring storage of infinite-step future statesas prediction targets.

Yet,their widespread success is limited by usability issues, specifically thedisparity between user input and software control along the autonomy continuum.To address this, shared control concepts provide opportunities to combine thetargeted increase of user autonomy with a certain level of computer assistance.This paper presents the free and open-source AdaptiX XR framework fordeveloping and evaluating shared control applications in a high-resolutionsimulation environment. The initial framework consists of a simulated roboticarm with an example scenario in Virtual Reality (VR), multiple standard controlinterfaces, and a specialized recording/replay system. AdaptiX can easily beextended for specific research needs, allowing Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)researchers to rapidly design and test novel interaction methods, interventionstrategies, and multi-modal feedback techniques, without requiring an actualphysical robotic arm during the early phases of ideation, prototyping, andevaluation. Also, a Robot Operating System (ROS) integration enables thecontrolling of a real robotic arm in a PhysicalTwin approach without anysimulation-reality gap. Here, we review the capabilities and limitations ofAdaptiX in detail and present three bodies of research based on the framework.AdaptiX can be accessed at https://adaptix.robot-research.de.</description><author>Max Pascher, Felix Ferdinand Goldau, Kirill Kronhardt, Udo Frese, Jens Gerken</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 15:44:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15887v1</guid></item><item><title>Fully Adaptive Composition in Differential Privacy</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05481v3</link><description>Composition is a key feature of differential privacy. Well-known advancedcomposition theorems allow one to query a private database quadratically moretimes than basic privacy composition would permit. However, these resultsrequire that the privacy parameters of all algorithms be fixed beforeinteracting with the data. To address this, Rogers et al. introduced fullyadaptive composition, wherein both algorithms and their privacy parameters canbe selected adaptively. They defined two probabilistic objects to measureprivacy in adaptive composition: privacy filters, which provide differentialprivacy guarantees for composed interactions, and privacy odometers,time-uniform bounds on privacy loss. There are substantial gaps betweenadvanced composition and existing filters and odometers. First, existingfilters place stronger assumptions on the algorithms being composed. Second,these odometers and filters suffer from large constants, making themimpractical. We construct filters that match the rates of advanced composition,including constants, despite allowing for adaptively chosen privacy parameters.En route we also derive a privacy filter for approximate zCDP. We alsoconstruct several general families of odometers. These odometers match thetightness of advanced composition at an arbitrary, preselected point in time,or at all points in time simultaneously, up to a doubly-logarithmic factor. Weobtain our results by leveraging advances in martingale concentration. In sum,we show that fully adaptive privacy is obtainable at almost no loss.</description><author>Justin Whitehouse, Aaditya Ramdas, Ryan Rogers, Zhiwei Steven Wu</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 15:37:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05481v3</guid></item><item><title>Perceptual Quality Assessment of NeRF and Neural View Synthesis Methods for Front-Facing Views</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15206v3</link><description>Neural view synthesis (NVS) is one of the most successful techniques forsynthesizing free viewpoint videos, capable of achieving high fidelity fromonly a sparse set of captured images.

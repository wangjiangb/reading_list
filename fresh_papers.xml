However, due to the inherent flaws of currentretrieval systems, there might exist irrelevant information within thoseretrieving top-ranked passages. In this work, we present a comprehensiveinvestigation into the robustness of LLMs to different types of irrelevantinformation under various conditions. We initially introduce a framework toconstruct high-quality irrelevant information that ranges from semanticallyunrelated, partially related, and related to questions. Furthermore, ouranalysis demonstrates that the constructed irrelevant information not onlyscores highly on similarity metrics, being highly retrieved by existingsystems, but also bears semantic connections to the context. Our investigationreveals that current LLMs still face challenges in discriminating highlysemantically related information and can be easily distracted by theseirrelevant yet misleading content. Besides, we also find that current solutionsfor handling irrelevant information have limitations in improving therobustness of LLMs to such distractions.

The study introduces a text-based game environment, namedAmongAgents, that mirrors the dynamics of Among Us. Players act as crew membersaboard a spaceship, tasked with identifying impostors who are sabotaging theship and eliminating the crew. Within this environment, the behavior ofsimulated language agents is analyzed. The experiments involve diverse gamesequences featuring different configurations of Crewmates and Impostorpersonality archetypes. Our work demonstrates that state-of-the-art largelanguage models (LLMs) can effectively grasp the game rules and make decisionsbased on the current context. This work aims to promote further exploration ofLLMs in goal-oriented games with incomplete information and complex actionspaces, as these settings offer valuable opportunities to assess language modelperformance in socially driven scenarios.</description><author>Yizhou Chi, Lingjun Mao, Zineng Tang</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 15:12:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16521v2</guid></item><item><title>Velocity Driven Vision: Asynchronous Sensor Fusion Birds Eye View Models for Autonomous Vehicles</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16636v2</link><description>Fusing different sensor modalities can be a difficult task, particularly ifthey are asynchronous. Asynchronisation may arise due to long processing timesor improper synchronisation during calibration, and there must exist a way tostill utilise this previous information for the purpose of safe driving, andobject detection in ego vehicle/ multi-agent trajectory prediction.Difficulties arise in the fact that the sensor modalities have capturedinformation at different times and also at different positions in space.Therefore, they are not spatially nor temporally aligned. This paper willinvestigate the challenge of radar and LiDAR sensors being asynchronousrelative to the camera sensors, for various time latencies. The spatialalignment will be resolved before lifting into BEV space via the transformationof the radar/LiDAR point clouds into the new ego frame coordinate system. Onlyafter this can we concatenate the radar/LiDAR point cloud and lifted camerafeatures. Temporal alignment will be remedied for radar data only, we willimplement a novel method of inferring the future radar point positions usingthe velocity information. Our approach to resolving the issue of sensorasynchrony yields promising results. We demonstrate velocity information candrastically improve IoU for asynchronous datasets, as for a time latency of 360milliseconds (ms), IoU improves from 49.54 to 53.63. Additionally, for a timelatency of 550ms, the camera+radar (C+R) model outperforms the camera+LiDAR(C+L) model by 0.18 IoU. This is an advancement in utilising theoften-neglected radar sensor modality, which is less favoured than LiDAR forautonomous driving purposes.</description><author>Seamie Hayes, Sushil Sharma, Ciar√°n Eising</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 13:04:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16636v2</guid></item><item><title>On the Utility of Speech and Audio Foundation Models for Marmoset Call Analysis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16417v2</link><description>Marmoset monkeys encode vital information in their calls and serve as asurrogate model for neuro-biologists to understand the evolutionary origins ofhuman vocal communication. Traditionally analyzed with signal processing-basedfeatures, recent approaches have utilized self-supervised models pre-trained onhuman speech for feature extraction, capitalizing on their ability to learn asignal's intrinsic structure independently of its acoustic domain. However, theutility of such foundation models remains unclear for marmoset call analysis interms of multi-class classification, bandwidth, and pre-training domain. Thisstudy assesses feature representations derived from speech and general audiodomains, across pre-training bandwidths of 4, 8, and 16 kHz for marmosetcall-type and caller classification tasks. Results show that models with higherbandwidth improve performance, and pre-training on speech or general audioyields comparable results, improving over a spectral baseline.</description><author>Eklavya Sarkar, Mathew Magimai. -Doss</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 11:19:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16417v2</guid></item><item><title>Audio Prompt Adapter: Unleashing Music Editing Abilities for Text-to-Music with Lightweight Finetuning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16564v2</link><description>Text-to-music models allow users to generate nearly realistic musical audiowith textual commands. However, editing music audios remains challenging due tothe conflicting desiderata of performing fine-grained alterations on the audiowhile maintaining a simple user interface. To address this challenge, wepropose Audio Prompt Adapter (or AP-Adapter), a lightweight addition topretrained text-to-music models. We utilize AudioMAE to extract features fromthe input audio, and construct attention-based adapters to feedthese featuresinto the internal layers of AudioLDM2, a diffusion-based text-to-music model.With 22M trainable parameters, AP-Adapter empowers users to harness both global(e.g., genre and timbre) and local (e.g., melody) aspects of music, using theoriginal audio and a short text as inputs. Through objective and subjectivestudies, we evaluate AP-Adapter on three tasks: timbre transfer, genretransfer, and accompaniment generation. Additionally, we demonstrate itseffectiveness on out-of-domain audios containing unseen instruments duringtraining.</description><author>Fang-Duo Tsai, Shih-Lun Wu, Haven Kim, Bo-Yu Chen, Hao-Chung Cheng, Yi-Hsuan Yang</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 11:12:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16564v2</guid></item><item><title>A Simulation Benchmark for Autonomous Racing with Large-Scale Human Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16680v2</link><description>Despite the availability of international prize-money competitions, scaledvehicles, and simulation environments, research on autonomous racing and thecontrol of sports cars operating close to the limit of handling has beenlimited by the high costs of vehicle acquisition and management, as well as thelimited physics accuracy of open-source simulators. In this paper, we propose aracing simulation platform based on the simulator Assetto Corsa to test,validate, and benchmark autonomous driving algorithms, including reinforcementlearning (RL) and classical Model Predictive Control (MPC), in realistic andchallenging scenarios. Our contributions include the development of thissimulation platform, several state-of-the-art algorithms tailored to the racingenvironment, and a comprehensive dataset collected from human drivers.Additionally, we evaluate algorithms in the offline RL setting.

Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required fortraditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient inreal-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. Weobserve that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of videosamples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apartspatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motioninformation via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without consideringdensity, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, wepropose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOralfrAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with sucharchitecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different featurechannels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead ofsimple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured,using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information thanadjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts furtherprovides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-artperformance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101,and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness,pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

Currently, effectively explainingthese models with saliency maps is challenging due to the high dimensions ofinput images multiplied by the ever-growing number of segmented class labels.To this end, we introduce Agg^2Exp, a methodology for aggregating fine-grainedvoxel attributions of the segmentation model's predictions. Unlike classicalexplanation methods that primarily focus on the local feature attribution,Agg^2Exp enables a more comprehensive global view on the importance ofpredicted segments in 3D images. Our benchmarking experiments show thatgradient-based voxel attributions are more faithful to the model's predictionsthan perturbation-based explanations. As a concrete use-case, we apply Agg^2Expto discover knowledge acquired by the Swin UNEt TRansformer model trained onthe TotalSegmentator v2 dataset for segmenting anatomical structures incomputed tomography medical images. Agg^2Exp facilitates the explanatoryanalysis of large segmentation models beyond their predictive performance.</description><author>Maciej Chrabaszcz, Hubert Baniecki, Piotr Komorowski, Szymon P≈Çotka, Przemyslaw Biecek</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 07:18:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16653v2</guid></item><item><title>A Faster Branching Algorithm for the Maximum $k$-Defective Clique Problem</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16588v2</link><description>A $k$-defective clique of an undirected graph $G$ is a subset of its verticesthat induces a nearly complete graph with a maximum of $k$ missing edges. Themaximum $k$-defective clique problem, which asks for the largest $k$-defectiveclique from the given graph, is important in many applications, such as socialand biological network analysis. In the paper, we propose a new branchingalgorithm that takes advantage of the structural properties of the$k$-defective clique and uses the efficient maximum clique algorithm as asubroutine. As a result, the algorithm has a better asymptotic running timethan the existing ones. We also investigate upper-bounding techniques andpropose a new upper bound utilizing the \textit{conflict relationship} betweenvertex pairs. Because conflict relationship is common in many graph problems,we believe that this technique can be potentially generalized. Finally,experiments show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on awide range of open benchmarks.</description><author>Chunyu Luo, Yi Zhou, Zhengren Wang, Mingyu Xiao</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 02:44:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16588v2</guid></item><item><title>MicroEmo: Time-Sensitive Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Micro-Expression Dynamics in Video Dialogues</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16552v2</link><description>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkablemultimodal emotion recognition capabilities, integrating multimodal cues fromvisual, acoustic, and linguistic contexts in the video to recognize humanemotional states. However, existing methods ignore capturing local facialfeatures of temporal dynamics of micro-expressions and do not leverage thecontextual dependencies of the utterance-aware temporal segments in the video,thereby limiting their expected effectiveness to a certain extent. In thiswork, we propose MicroEmo, a time-sensitive MLLM aimed at directing attentionto the local facial micro-expression dynamics and the contextual dependenciesof utterance-aware video clips. Our model incorporates two key architecturalcontributions: (1) a global-local attention visual encoder that integratesglobal frame-level timestamp-bound image features with local facial features oftemporal dynamics of micro-expressions; (2) an utterance-aware video Q-Formerthat captures multi-scale and contextual dependencies by generating visualtoken sequences for each utterance segment and for the entire video thencombining them. Preliminary qualitative experiments demonstrate that in a newExplainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) task that exploitsmulti-modal and multi-faceted clues to predict emotions in an open-vocabulary(OV) manner, MicroEmo demonstrates its effectiveness compared with the latestmethods.</description><author>Liyun Zhang</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 01:09:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16552v2</guid></item><item><title>FCNR: Fast Compressive Neural Representation of Visualization Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16369v2</link><description>We present FCNR, a fast compressive neural representation for tens ofthousands of visualization images under varying viewpoints and timesteps.

Starting with images that facilitate depth prediction due to the absenceof unfavorable factors, we systematically generate new, user-defined sceneswith a comprehensive set of challenges and associated depth information. Thisis achieved by leveraging cutting-edge text-to-image diffusion models withdepth-aware control, known for synthesizing high-quality image content fromtextual prompts while preserving the coherence of 3D structure betweengenerated and source imagery.

AbdomenAtlas provides 673Khigh-quality masks of anatomical structures in the abdominal region annotatedby a team of 10 radiologists with the help of AI algorithms. We start by havingexpert radiologists manually annotate 22 anatomical structures in 5,246 CTvolumes. Following this, a semi-automatic annotation procedure is performed forthe remaining CT volumes, where radiologists revise the annotations predictedby AI, and in turn, AI improves its predictions by learning from revisedannotations. Such a large-scale, detailed-annotated, and multi-center datasetis needed for two reasons. Firstly, AbdomenAtlas provides important resourcesfor AI development at scale, branded as large pre-trained models, which canalleviate the annotation workload of expert radiologists to transfer to broaderclinical applications. Secondly, AbdomenAtlas establishes a large-scalebenchmark for evaluating AI algorithms -- the more data we use to test thealgorithms, the better we can guarantee reliable performance in complexclinical scenarios. An ISBI &amp; MICCAI challenge named BodyMaps: Towards 3D Atlasof Human Body was launched using a subset of our AbdomenAtlas, aiming tostimulate AI innovation and to benchmark segmentation accuracy, inferenceefficiency, and domain generalizability. We hope our AbdomenAtlas can set thestage for larger-scale clinical trials and offer exceptional opportunities topractitioners in the medical imaging community.

We demonstrate that asimple approach to feature engineering - employing histogram aggregation ofedge descriptors and one-hot encoding for atomic numbers and bond types - whencombined with a Random Forest classifier, can establish a strong baseline forGraph Neural Networks (GNNs). The novel algorithm, Molecular TopologicalProfile (MOLTOP), integrates Edge Betweenness Centrality, Adjusted Rand Indexand SCAN Structural Similarity score. This approach proves to be remarkablycompetitive when compared to modern GNNs, while also being simple, fast,low-variance and hyperparameter-free. Our approach is rigorously tested onMoleculeNet datasets using fair evaluation protocol provided by Open GraphBenchmark. We additionally show out-of-domain generation capabilities onpeptide classification task from Long Range Graph Benchmark. The evaluationsacross eleven benchmark datasets reveal MOLTOP's strong discriminativecapabilities, surpassing the $1$-WL test and even $3$-WL test for some classesof graphs. Our conclusion is that descriptor-based baselines, such as the onewe propose, are still crucial for accurately assessing advancements in the GNNdomain.</description><author>Jakub Adamczyk, Wojciech Czech</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 17:58:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12136v3</guid></item><item><title>PartGLEE: A Foundation Model for Recognizing and Parsing Any Objects</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16696v1</link><description>We present PartGLEE, a part-level foundation model for locating andidentifying both objects and parts in images.

We further introduce Task Haystack, an evaluationsuite dedicated to assessing and diagnosing how long-context LMs utilizescontexts in Lifelong ICL. When given a task instruction and test inputs,long-context LMs are expected to leverage the relevant demonstrations in theLifelong ICL prompt, avoid distraction and interference from other tasks, andachieve test accuracies that are not significantly worse than the Single-taskICL baseline. Task Haystack draws inspiration from the widely-adopted"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) evaluation, but presents new and uniquechallenges. It demands that models (1) utilize the contexts with deeperunderstanding, rather than resorting to simple copying and pasting; (2)navigate through long streams of evolving topics and tasks, which closelyapproximates the complexities of real-world usage of long-context LMs.Additionally, Task Haystack inherits the controllability aspect of NIAH,providing model developers with tools and visualizations to identify modelvulnerabilities effectively. We benchmark 12 long-context LMs using Task Haystack. We find thatstate-of-the-art closed models such as GPT-4o still struggle in this setting,failing 15% of the cases on average, while all open-weight models we evaluatefurther lack behind by a large margin, failing up to 61% of the cases. In ourcontrolled analysis, we identify factors such as distraction and recency biasas contributors to these failure cases. Further, we observe declines inperformance when task instructions are paraphrased at test time or when ICLdemonstrations are repeated excessively, raising concerns about the robustness,instruction understanding, and true context utilization of current long-contextLMs.</description><author>Xiaoyue Xu, Qinyuan Ye, Xiang Ren</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 17:57:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16695v1</guid></item><item><title>Explanation Regularisation through the Lens of Attributions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16693v1</link><description>Explanation regularisation (ER) has been introduced as a way to guide modelsto make their predictions in a manner more akin to humans, i.e., making theirattributions "plausible". This is achieved by introducing an auxiliaryexplanation loss, that measures how well the output of an input attributiontechnique for the model agrees with relevant human-annotated rationales. Onepositive outcome of using ER appears to be improved performance inout-of-domain (OOD) settings, presumably due to an increased reliance on"plausible" tokens. However, previous work has under-explored the impact of theER objective on model attributions, in particular when obtained with techniquesother than the one used to train ER. In this work, we contribute a study ofER's effectiveness at informing classification decisions on plausible tokens,and the relationship between increased plausibility and robustness to OODconditions. Through a series of analyses, we find that the connection betweenER and the ability of a classifier to rely on plausible features has beenoverstated and that a stronger reliance on plausible tokens does not seem to bethe cause for any perceived OOD improvements.</description><author>Pedro Ferreira, Wilker Aziz, Ivan Titov</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 17:56:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16693v1</guid></item><item><title>Deep learning empowered sensor fusion boosts infant movement classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09014v4</link><description>There is a recent boom in the development of AI solutions to facilitate andenhance diagnostic procedures for established clinical tools. To assess theintegrity of the developing nervous system, the Prechtl general movementassessment (GMA) is recognized for its clinical value in diagnosingneurological impairments in early infancy. GMA has been increasingly augmentedthrough machine learning approaches intending to scale-up its application,circumvent costs in the training of human assessors and further standardizeclassification of spontaneous motor patterns. Available deep learning tools,all of which are based on single sensor modalities, are however stillconsiderably inferior to that of well-trained human assessors. These approachesare hardly comparable as all models are designed, trained and evaluated onproprietary/silo-data sets. With this study we propose a sensor fusion approachfor assessing fidgety movements (FMs) comparing three different sensormodalities (pressure, inertial, and visual sensors). Various combinations andtwo sensor fusion approaches (late and early fusion) for infant movementclassification were tested to evaluate whether a multi-sensor systemoutperforms single modality assessments. The performance of the three-sensorfusion (classification accuracy of 94.5\%) was significantly higher than thatof any single modality evaluated, suggesting the sensor fusion approach is apromising avenue for automated classification of infant motor patterns.

As a solution, we proposeDynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cachecompression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to applydifferent compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofitpre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers,achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on anNVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligiblepercentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMCpreserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression,outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value evictionpolicies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compoundedgains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existingLLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.</description><author>Piotr Nawrot, Adrian ≈Åa≈Ñcucki, Marcin Chochowski, David Tarjan, Edoardo M.

Our method begins by identifying the instrumentpresent within a source recording in order to choose its corresponding idealspectrum as a target.

To this end, we build upon adifferentiable parametric equalizer matching neural network, demonstratingimprovements relative to previously established state-of-the-art.

In our study, we introduceAutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by promptoptimization.

Thisdemanding workload elevates the risk of human error, potentially leading totreatment delays, increased healthcare costs, revenue loss, and operationalinefficiencies. To address these challenges, we initiate a series of work ongrounded Automatic Report Generation (AutoRG), starting from the brain MRIinterpretation system, which supports the delineation of brain structures, thelocalization of anomalies, and the generation of well-organized findings. Wemake contributions from the following aspects, first, on dataset construction,we release a comprehensive dataset encompassing segmentation masks of anomalyregions and manually authored reports, termed as RadGenome-Brain MRI. This dataresource is intended to catalyze ongoing research and development in the fieldof AI-assisted report generation systems. Second, on system design, we proposeAutoRG-Brain, the first brain MRI report generation system with pixel-levelgrounded visual clues. Third, for evaluation, we conduct quantitativeassessments and human evaluations of brain structure segmentation, anomalylocalization, and report generation tasks to provide evidence of itsreliability and accuracy. This system has been integrated into real clinicalscenarios, where radiologists were instructed to write reports based on ourgenerated findings and anomaly segmentation masks.

This paper presents SAM-CP, a simple approach thatestablishes two types of composable prompts beyond SAM and composes them forversatile segmentation. Specifically, given a set of classes (in texts) and aset of SAM patches, the Type-I prompt judges whether a SAM patch aligns with atext label, and the Type-II prompt judges whether two SAM patches with the sametext label also belong to the same instance. To decrease the complexity indealing with a large number of semantic classes and patches, we establish aunified framework that calculates the affinity between (semantic and instance)queries and SAM patches and merges patches with high affinity to the query.Experiments show that SAM-CP achieves semantic, instance, and panopticsegmentation in both open and closed domains. In particular, it achievesstate-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary segmentation.

However, in tasks that require locallycorrective behaviors like multi-part assembly, learning robust policies purelyfrom human demonstrations remains challenging. Reinforcement learning (RL) canmitigate these limitations by allowing policies to acquire locally correctivebehaviors through task reward supervision and exploration. This paper exploresthe use of RL fine-tuning to improve upon BC-trained policies in precisemanipulation tasks. We analyze and overcome technical challenges associatedwith using RL to directly train policy networks that incorporate modernarchitectural components like diffusion models and action chunking. We proposetraining residual policies on top of frozen BC-trained diffusion models usingstandard policy gradient methods and sparse rewards, an approach we call ResiP(Residual for Precise manipulation). Our experimental results demonstrate thatthis residual learning framework can significantly improve success rates beyondthe base BC-trained models in high-precision assembly tasks by learningcorrective actions. We also show that by combining ResiP with teacher-studentdistillation and visual domain randomization, our method can enable learningreal-world policies for robotic assembly directly from RGB images.

Instead, it offers a fairer andmore comprehensive comparison of KAN and MLP models across various tasks,including machine learning, computer vision, audio processing, natural languageprocessing, and symbolic formula representation. Specifically, we control thenumber of parameters and FLOPs to compare the performance of KAN and MLP. Ourmain observation is that, except for symbolic formula representation tasks, MLPgenerally outperforms KAN. We also conduct ablation studies on KAN and findthat its advantage in symbolic formula representation mainly stems from itsB-spline activation function. When B-spline is applied to MLP, performance insymbolic formula representation significantly improves, surpassing or matchingthat of KAN. However, in other tasks where MLP already excels over KAN,B-spline does not substantially enhance MLP's performance. Furthermore, we findthat KAN's forgetting issue is more severe than that of MLP in a standardclass-incremental continual learning setting, which differs from the findingsreported in the KAN paper. We hope these results provide insights for futureresearch on KAN and other MLP alternatives.

Theseapplications have significantly expanded the attack surface of LLMs, exposingthem to a variety of threats. Among them, jailbreak attacks that induce toxicresponses through jailbreak prompts have raised critical safety concerns. Toidentify these threats, a growing number of red teaming approaches simulatepotential adversarial scenarios by crafting jailbreak prompts to test thetarget LLM. However, existing red teaming methods do not consider the uniquevulnerabilities of LLM in different scenarios, making it difficult to adjustthe jailbreak prompts to find context-specific vulnerabilities. Meanwhile,these methods are limited to refining jailbreak templates using a few mutationoperations, lacking the automation and scalability to adapt to differentscenarios. To enable context-aware and efficient red teaming, we abstract andmodel existing attacks into a coherent concept called "jailbreak strategy" andpropose a multi-agent LLM system named RedAgent that leverages these strategiesto generate context-aware jailbreak prompts. By self-reflecting on contextualfeedback in an additional memory buffer, RedAgent continuously learns how toleverage these strategies to achieve effective jailbreaks in specific contexts.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can jailbreak most black-boxLLMs in just five queries, improving the efficiency of existing red teamingmethods by two times. Additionally, RedAgent can jailbreak customized LLMapplications more efficiently. By generating context-aware jailbreak promptstowards applications on GPTs, we discover 60 severe vulnerabilities of thesereal-world applications with only two queries per vulnerability.

However, how totrain Diffusion Models to have the disentangled latent spaces and how tonaturally incorporate the disentangled conditions during the sampling processhave been underexplored. In this paper, we present a training framework forfeature disentanglement of Diffusion Models (FDiff). We further propose twosampling methods that can boost the realism of our Diffusion Models and alsoenhance the controllability. Concisely, we train Diffusion Models conditionedon two latent features, a spatial content mask, and a flattened styleembedding. We rely on the inductive bias of the denoising process of DiffusionModels to encode pose/layout information in the content feature andsemantic/style information in the style feature. Regarding the samplingmethods, we first generalize Composable Diffusion Models (GCDM) by breaking theconditional independence assumption to allow for some dependence betweenconditional inputs, which is shown to be effective in realistic generation inour experiments. Second, we propose timestep-dependent weight scheduling forcontent and style features to further improve the performance. We also observebetter controllability of our proposed methods compared to existing methods inimage manipulation and image translation.</description><author>Wonwoong Cho, Hareesh Ravi, Midhun Harikumar, Vinh Khuc, Krishna Kumar Singh, Jingwan Lu, David I.

These movements are among the swiftest produced byhumans and possess the potential to achieve velocities greater than that ofblinks. The peak angular speed of the eye during a saccade can reach as high as700{\deg}/s in humans, especially during larger saccades that cover a visualangle of 25{\deg}. Previous research has demonstrated encouraging outcomes incomprehending neurological conditions through the study of saccades. Anecessary step in saccade detection involves accurately identifying the preciselocation of the pupil within the eye, from which additional information such asgaze angles can be inferred. Conventional frame-based cameras often strugglewith the high temporal precision necessary for tracking very fast movements,resulting in motion blur and latency issues. Event cameras, on the other hand,offer a promising alternative by recording changes in the visual sceneasynchronously and providing high temporal resolution and low latency. Bybridging the gap between traditional computer vision and event-based vision, wepresent events as frames that can be readily utilized by standard deep learningalgorithms. This approach harnesses YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detectiontechnology, to process these frames for pupil tracking using the publiclyaccessible Ev-Eye dataset.

We attributethis to real-world inherent preferences and distributions as a simpler signalfor learning than the complex audio-visual grounding, which leads to thedisregard of important modality information. Generally, the anomalous phenomenaare often complex and cannot be directly observed systematically. In thisstudy, we made a pioneering effort with the proper synthetic data to categorizeand analyze phenomena as two types "audio priming bias" and "visual prior"according to the source of anomalies. For audio priming bias, to enhance audiosensitivity to different intensities and semantics, a perception modulespecifically for audio perceives the latent semantic information andincorporates information into a limited set of queries, namely active queries.Moreover, the interaction mechanism related to such active queries in thetransformer decoder is customized to adapt to the need for interactionregulating among audio semantics. For visual prior, multiple contrastivetraining strategies are explored to optimize the model by incorporating abiased branch, without even changing the structure of the model. Duringexperiments, observation demonstrates the presence and the impact that has beenproduced by the biases of the existing model. Finally, through experimentalevaluation of AVS benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodsin handling both types of biases, achieving competitive performance across allthree subsets.</description><author>Peiwen Sun, Honggang Zhang, Di Hu</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 16:55:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16638v1</guid></item><item><title>Course-Correction: Safety Alignment Using Synthetic Preferences</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16637v1</link><description>The risk of harmful content generated by large language models (LLMs) becomesa critical concern.

Asynchronisation may arise due to long processing timesor improper synchronisation during calibration, and there must exist a way tostill utilise this previous information for the purpose of safe driving, andobject detection in ego vehicle/ multi-agent trajectory prediction.Difficulties arise in the fact that the sensor modalities have capturedinformation at different times and also at different positions in space.Therefore, they are not spatially nor temporally aligned. This paper willinvestigate the challenge of radar and LiDAR sensors being asynchronousrelative to the camera sensors, for various time latencies. The spatialalignment will be resolved before lifting into BEV space via the transformationof the radar/LiDAR point clouds into the new ego frame coordinate system. Onlyafter this can we concatenate the radar/LiDAR point cloud and lifted camerafeatures. Temporal alignment will be remedied for radar data only, we willimplement a novel method of inferring the future radar point positions usingthe velocity information. Our approach to resolving the issue of sensorasynchrony yields promising results. We demonstrate velocity information candrastically improve IoU for asynchronous datasets, as for a time latency of 360milliseconds (ms), IoU improves from 49.54 to 53.63. Additionally, for a timelatency of 550ms, the camera+radar (C+R) model outperforms the camera+LiDAR(C+L) model by 0.18 IoU.

However, their effectivenessis limited by the long-tail distribution of training data, which leads toinaccuracies in rare cases. In this study, we address a long-standing challengeof improving the diagnostic model performance on rare cases using long-taileddata. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline, TAILOR, that builds aknowledge-driven generative model to produce tailored synthetic data. Thegenerative model, using 3,749 lesions as source data, can generate millions ofbreast-US images, especially for error-prone rare cases. The generated data canbe further used to build a diagnostic model for accurate and interpretablediagnoses. In the prospective external evaluation, our diagnostic modeloutperforms the average performance of nine radiologists by 33.5% inspecificity with the same sensitivity, improving their performance by providingpredictions with an interpretable decision-making process. Moreover, on ductalcarcinoma in situ (DCIS), our diagnostic model outperforms all radiologists bya large margin, with only 34 DCIS lesions in the source data.

Our analysissuggests a way to mitigate these challenges. We show that generalization can bemarkedly enhanced when considering a model's ability to predict the fraction ofdesired outcomes in a batch. This is promising, as the primary aim of screeningis not necessarily to pinpoint the label of each compound individually, butrather to assemble a batch enriched for desirable compounds.

This approach, known as inverse cognition, arises incounter-adversarial applications and has motivated the development of inverseBayesian filters. In this context, a cognitive adversary, such as a radar, usesa forward Bayesian filter to track its target of interest. An inverse filter isthen employed to infer adversary's estimate of target's or defender's state.Previous studies have addressed this inverse filtering problem by introducingmethods like inverse Kalman filter (I-KF), inverse extended KF (I-EKF), andinverse unscented KF (I-UKF). However, these inverse filters assume additiveGaussian noises and/or rely on local approximations of non-linear dynamics atthe state estimates, limiting their practical application. Contrarily, thispaper adopts a global filtering approach and develops an inverse particlefilter (I-PF). The particle filter framework employs Monte Carlo (MC) methodsto approximate arbitrary posterior distributions. Moreover, under mildsystem-level conditions, the proposed I-PF demonstrates convergence to theoptimal inverse filter. Additionally, we explore MC techniques to approximateGaussian posteriors and introduce inverse Gaussian PF (I-GPF) and inverseensemble KF (I-EnKF). Our I-GPF and I-EnKF can efficiently handle non-Gaussiannoises with suitable modifications. Additionally, we propose the differentiableI-PF, differentiable I-EnKF, and reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based EnKF(RKHS-EnKF) methods to address scenarios where system information is unknown todefender. Using recursive Cram\'er-Rao lower bound and non-credibility index(NCI), our numerical experiments for different applications demonstrate theestimation performance and time complexity of the proposed filters.</description><author>Himali Singh, Arpan Chattopadhyay, Kumar Vijay Mishra</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 16:32:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16623v1</guid></item><item><title>Graph Neural Networks for Learning Equivariant Representations of Neural Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12143v3</link><description>Neural networks that process the parameters of other neural networks findapplications in domains as diverse as classifying implicit neuralrepresentations, generating neural network weights, and predictinggeneralization errors.

Traditionally, these tasks are often delegated totrained research assistants. Motivated by the advances in language modeling,empirical legal scholars are increasingly turning to prompting commercialmodels, hoping that it will alleviate the significant cost of human annotation.Despite growing use, our understanding of how to best utilize large languagemodels for legal tasks remains limited. We conduct a comprehensive study of 260legal text classification tasks, nearly all new to the machine learningcommunity. Starting from GPT-4 as a baseline, we show that it has non-trivialbut highly varied zero-shot accuracy, often exhibiting performance that may beinsufficient for legal work. We then demonstrate that a lightly fine-tunedLlama 3 model vastly outperforms GPT-4 on almost all tasks, typically bydouble-digit percentage points. We find that larger models respond better tofine-tuning than smaller models. A few tens to hundreds of examples suffice toachieve high classification accuracy. Notably, we can fine-tune a single modelon all 260 tasks simultaneously at a small loss in accuracy relative to havinga separate model for each task. Our work points to a viable alternative to thepredominant practice of prompting commercial models.

This is due to their ability to treat theagent's trajectory in the environment as a sequence, thereby reducing thepolicy learning problem to sequence modeling. In environments where the agent'sdecisions depend on past events (POMDPs), capturing both the event itself andthe decision point in the context of the model is essential. However, thequadratic complexity of the attention mechanism limits the potential forcontext expansion. One solution to this problem is to enhance transformers withmemory mechanisms. This paper proposes a Recurrent Action Transformer withMemory (RATE), a novel model architecture incorporating a recurrent memorymechanism designed to regulate information retention. To evaluate our model, weconducted extensive experiments on memory-intensive environments(ViZDoom-Two-Colors, T-Maze, Memory Maze, Minigrid.Memory), classic Atari gamesand MuJoCo control environments. The results show that using memory cansignificantly improve performance in memory-intensive environments whilemaintaining or improving results in classic environments.

Inparticular, little is known about the proportions of various domains orlanguages represented. In this work, we tackle a task which we call datamixture inference, which aims to uncover the distributional make-up of trainingdata. We introduce a novel attack based on a previously overlooked source ofinformation -- byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers, used by the vast majorityof modern language models. Our key insight is that the ordered list of mergerules learned by a BPE tokenizer naturally reveals information about the tokenfrequencies in its training data: the first merge is the most common byte pair,the second is the most common pair after merging the first token, and so on.Given a tokenizer's merge list along with data samples for each category ofinterest, we formulate a linear program that solves for the proportion of eachcategory in the tokenizer's training set. Importantly, to the extent to whichtokenizer training data is representative of the pretraining data, weindirectly learn about the pretraining data. In controlled experiments, we showthat our attack recovers mixture ratios with high precision for tokenizerstrained on known mixtures of natural languages, programming languages, and datasources. We then apply our approach to off-the-shelf tokenizers released withrecent LMs. We confirm much publicly disclosed information about these models,and also make several new inferences: GPT-4o's tokenizer is much moremultilingual than its predecessors, training on 39% non-English data; Llama3extends GPT-3.5's tokenizer primarily for multilingual (48%) use; GPT-3.5's andClaude's tokenizers are trained on predominantly code (~60%).

The TabPFN model, aspecial case of PFNs for tabular data, is able to achieve state-of-the-artperformance on a variety of classification tasks while producing posteriorpredictive distributions in mere seconds by in-context learning without theneed for learning parameters or hyperparameter tuning. This makes TabPFN a veryattractive option for a wide range of domain applications. However, a majordrawback of the method is its lack of interpretability. Therefore, we proposeseveral adaptations of popular interpretability methods that we specificallydesign for TabPFN. By taking advantage of the unique properties of the model,our adaptations allow for more efficient computations than existingimplementations. In particular, we show how in-context learning facilitates theestimation of Shapley values by avoiding approximate retraining and enables theuse of Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO) even when working with large-scaleTransformers. In addition, we demonstrate how data valuation methods can beused to address scalability challenges of TabPFN.

A solution, in terms of optimal weightsand state update rules, is derived by training each individual neuron toperform either kernel classification or interpolation with a minimum weightnorm. By applying this method to feed-forward and recurrent networks, we deriveoptimal models, termed kernel memory networks, that include, as special cases,many of the hetero- and auto-associative memory models that have been proposedover the past years, such as modern Hopfield networks and Kanerva's sparsedistributed memory. We modify Kanerva's model and demonstrate a simple way todesign a kernel memory network that can store an exponential number ofcontinuous-valued patterns with a finite basin of attraction. The framework ofkernel memory networks offers a simple and intuitive way to understand thestorage capacity of previous memory models, and allows for new biologicalinterpretations in terms of dendritic non-linearities and synaptic cross-talk.</description><author>Georgios Iatropoulos, Johanni Brea, Wulfram Gerstner</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 16:09:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09416v3</guid></item><item><title>Shared Imagination: LLMs Hallucinate Alike</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16604v1</link><description>Despite the recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs), theirtraining recipes -- model architecture, pre-training data and optimizationalgorithm -- are often very similar.

In IQA, we ask one model to generate purely imaginary questions(e.g., on completely made-up concepts in physics) and prompt another model toanswer. Surprisingly, despite the total fictionality of these questions, allmodels can answer each other's questions with remarkable success, suggesting a"shared imagination space" in which these models operate during suchhallucinations.

This barrier maybe induced by the environment that hinders patients from sharing theirexperiences openly with healthcare professionals. As patients are observed todiscuss and exchange knowledge more candidly on social media, valuable insightscan be leveraged from these platforms. However, the abundance of non-patientposts on social media necessitates filtering out such irrelevant content todistinguish the genuine voices of patients, a task we refer to as patient voiceclassification. In this study, we analyse the importance of linguisticcharacteristics in accurately classifying patient voices. Our findingsunderscore the essential role of linguistic and statistical text similarityanalysis in identifying common patterns among patient groups. These resultsallude to even starker differences in the way patients express themselves at adisease level and across various therapeutic domains. Additionally, wefine-tuned a pre-trained Language Model on the combined datasets with similarlinguistic patterns, resulting in a highly accurate automatic patient voiceclassification.

In the paper, we propose a new branchingalgorithm that takes advantage of the structural properties of the$k$-defective clique and uses the efficient maximum clique algorithm as asubroutine. As a result, the algorithm has a better asymptotic running timethan the existing ones. We also investigate upper-bounding techniques andpropose a new upper bound utilizing the \textit{conflict relationship} betweenvertex pairs. Because conflict relationship is common in many graph problems,we believe that this technique can be potentially generalized.

However, training and deploying large-scale models onresource-constrained devices is challenging. Fortunately, Split FederatedLearning (SFL) offers a feasible solution by alleviating the computation and/orcommunication burden on clients. However, existing SFL works often assumesufficient labeled data on clients, which is usually impractical. Besides, datanon-IIDness poses another challenge to ensure efficient model training. To ourbest knowledge, the above two issues have not been simultaneously addressed inSFL. Herein, we propose a novel Semi-supervised SFL system, termed SemiSFL,which incorporates clustering regularization to perform SFL with unlabeled andnon-IID client data. Moreover, our theoretical and experimental investigationsinto model convergence reveal that the inconsistent training processes onlabeled and unlabeled data have an influence on the effectiveness of clusteringregularization. To mitigate the training inconsistency, we develop an algorithmfor dynamically adjusting the global updating frequency, so as to improvetraining performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark models and datasetsshow that our system provides a 3.8x speed-up in training time, reduces thecommunication cost by about 70.3% while reaching the target accuracy, andachieves up to 5.8% improvement in accuracy under non-IID scenarios compared tothe state-of-the-art baselines.</description><author>Yang Xu, Yunming Liao, Hongli Xu, Zhipeng Sun, Liusheng Huang, Chunming Qiao</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 15:30:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15870v4</guid></item><item><title>Timeliness-Fidelity Tradeoff in 3D Scene Representations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16575v1</link><description>Real-time three-dimensional (3D) scene representations serve as one of thebuilding blocks that bolster various innovative applications, e.g., digitalmanufacturing, Virtual/Augmented/Extended/Mixed Reality (VR/AR/XR/MR), and themetaverse.

Although several recentapproaches have tried to provide token-level (i.e., dense) rewards for eachindividual token, these typically rely on predefined discrete reward values(e.g., positive: +1, negative: -1, neutral: 0), failing to account for varyingdegrees of preference inherent to each token.

However, existing countermeasuresstill serve a classification purpose and fail to perform meaningful analysis ofthe start and end timestamps of partial forgery segments. To address thischallenge, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine proposal refinement framework(CFPRF) that incorporates a frame-level detection network (FDN) and a proposalrefinement network (PRN) for audio temporal forgery detection and localization.Specifically, the FDN aims to mine informative inconsistency cues between realand fake frames to obtain discriminative features that are beneficial forroughly indicating forgery regions. The PRN is responsible for predictingconfidence scores and regression offsets to refine the coarse-grained proposalsderived from the FDN. To learn robust discriminative features, we devise adifference-aware feature learning (DAFL) module guided by contrastiverepresentation learning to enlarge the sensitive differences between differentframes induced by minor manipulations. We further design a boundary-awarefeature enhancement (BAFE) module to capture the contextual information ofmultiple transition boundaries and guide the interaction between boundaryinformation and temporal features via a cross-attention mechanism.

However, existing methods ignore capturing local facialfeatures of temporal dynamics of micro-expressions and do not leverage thecontextual dependencies of the utterance-aware temporal segments in the video,thereby limiting their expected effectiveness to a certain extent. In thiswork, we propose MicroEmo, a time-sensitive MLLM aimed at directing attentionto the local facial micro-expression dynamics and the contextual dependenciesof utterance-aware video clips. Our model incorporates two key architecturalcontributions: (1) a global-local attention visual encoder that integratesglobal frame-level timestamp-bound image features with local facial features oftemporal dynamics of micro-expressions; (2) an utterance-aware video Q-Formerthat captures multi-scale and contextual dependencies by generating visualtoken sequences for each utterance segment and for the entire video thencombining them. Preliminary qualitative experiments demonstrate that in a newExplainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) task that exploitsmulti-modal and multi-faceted clues to predict emotions in an open-vocabulary(OV) manner, MicroEmo demonstrates its effectiveness compared with the latestmethods.</description><author>Liyun Zhang</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 15:05:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16552v1</guid></item><item><title>A Kernel-Based Conditional Two-Sample Test Using Nearest Neighbors (with Applications to Calibration, Regression Curves, and Simulation-Based Inference)</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16550v1</link><description>In this paper we introduce a kernel-based measure for detecting differencesbetween two conditional distributions. Using the `kernel trick' andnearest-neighbor graphs, we propose a consistent estimate of this measure whichcan be computed in nearly linear time (for a fixed number of nearestneighbors). Moreover, when the two conditional distributions are the same, theestimate has a Gaussian limit and its asymptotic variance has a simple formthat can be easily estimated from the data. The resulting test attains preciseasymptotic level and is universally consistent for detecting differencesbetween two conditional distributions. We also provide a resampling based testusing our estimate that applies to the conditional goodness-of-fit problem,which controls Type I error in finite samples and is asymptotically consistentwith only a finite number of resamples. A method to de-randomize the resamplingtest is also presented. The proposed methods can be readily applied to a broadrange of problems, ranging from classical nonparametric statistics to modernmachine learning. Specifically, we explore three applications: testing modelcalibration, regression curve evaluation, and validation of emulator models insimulation-based inference. We illustrate the superior performance of ourmethod for these tasks, both in simulations as well as on real data. Inparticular, we apply our method to (1) assess the calibration of neural networkmodels trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, (2) compare regression functions forwind power generation across two different turbines, and (3) validate emulatormodels on benchmark examples with intractable posteriors and for generatingsynthetic `redshift' associated with galaxy images.</description><author>Anirban Chatterjee, Ziang Niu, Bhaswar B.

This behavior is beyondthe scope of the traditional empirical risk minimization paradigm, whichassumes i.i.d. distribution of data over time and across locations. Theemerging field of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization addresses thisreality with new theory and algorithms which incorporate "environmental", or"era-wise" information into the algorithms. So far, most research has beenfocused on linear models and/or neural networks . In this research we developtwo new splitting criteria for decision trees, which allow us to apply ideasfrom OOD generalization research to decision tree models, namely, gradientboosting decision trees (GBDTs). The new splitting criteria use era-wiseinformation associated with the data to grow tree-based models that are optimalacross all disjoint eras in the data, instead of optimal over the entire dataset pooled together, which is the default setting. In this paper, two newsplitting criteria are defined and analyzed theoretically. Effectiveness istested on four experiments, ranging from simple, synthetic to complex,real-world applications. In particular we cast the OOD domain-adaptationproblem in the context of financial markets, where the new models out-performstate-of-the-art GBDT models on the Numerai data set. The new criteria areincorporated into the Scikit-Learn code base and made freely available online.</description><author>Timothy DeLise</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 15:01:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14496v5</guid></item><item><title>Minimax Optimality of Score-based Diffusion Models: Beyond the Density Lower Bound Assumptions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15602v2</link><description>We study the asymptotic error of score-based diffusion model sampling inlarge-sample scenarios from a non-parametric statistics perspective. We showthat a kernel-based score estimator achieves an optimal mean square error of$\widetilde{O}\left(n^{-1} t^{-\frac{d+2}{2}}(t^{\frac{d}{2}} \vee 1)\right)$for the score function of $p_0*\mathcal{N}(0,t\boldsymbol{I}_d)$, where $n$ and$d$ represent the sample size and the dimension, $t$ is bounded above and belowby polynomials of $n$, and $p_0$ is an arbitrary sub-Gaussian distribution. Asa consequence, this yields an $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{-1/2}t^{-\frac{d}{4}}\right)$ upper bound for the total variation error of thedistribution of the sample generated by the diffusion model under a meresub-Gaussian assumption. If in addition, $p_0$ belongs to the nonparametricfamily of the $\beta$-Sobolev space with $\beta\le 2$, by adopting an earlystopping strategy, we obtain that the diffusion model is nearly (up to logfactors) minimax optimal. This removes the crucial lower bound assumption on$p_0$ in previous proofs of the minimax optimality of the diffusion model fornonparametric families.</description><author>Kaihong Zhang, Caitlyn H.

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multipleindependent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case ofend-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due tothe difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient objectpresence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation ofsurgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of thefield of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered inWSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks(VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information usingsemi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activationmaps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts whenspecifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided workswith a student network that integrates information over time by leveragingtemporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a publicreference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset whereobjects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Ourmethod outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superiorsegmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</description><author>Guiqiu Liao, Matjaz Jogan, Sai Koushik, Eric Eaton, Daniel A.

Simply uniformly sampling frames orindiscriminately aggregating frame-level visual features often falls short incapturing the nuanced and relevant contexts of videos to well perform VideoQA.To mitigate these issues, we propose VidF4, a novel VideoQA framework equippedwith tailored frame selection strategy for effective and efficient VideoQA. Wepropose three frame-scoring mechanisms that consider both question relevanceand inter-frame similarity to evaluate the importance of each frame for a givenquestion on the video. Furthermore, we design a differentiable adaptive framesampling mechanism to facilitate end-to-end training for the frame selector andanswer generator. The experimental results across three widely adoptedbenchmarks demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing VideoQAmethods, establishing a new SOTA across NExT-QA (+0.3%), STAR (+0.9%), and TVQA(+1.0%).

To alleviate this issue, we proposeAutoGPT+P, a system that combines an affordance-based scene representation witha planning system. Affordances encompass the action possibilities of an agenton the environment and objects present in it. Thus, deriving the planningdomain from an affordance-based scene representation allows symbolic planningwith arbitrary objects. AutoGPT+P leverages this representation to derive andexecute a plan for a task specified by the user in natural language. Inaddition to solving planning tasks under a closed-world assumption, AutoGPT+Pcan also handle planning with incomplete information, e. g., tasks with missingobjects by exploring the scene, suggesting alternatives, or providing a partialplan. The affordance-based scene representation combines object detection withan automatically generated object-affordance-mapping using ChatGPT. The coreplanning tool extends existing work by automatically correcting semantic andsyntactic errors. Our approach achieves a success rate of 98%, surpassing thecurrent 81% success rate of the current state-of-the-art LLM-based planningmethod SayCan on the SayCan instruction set. Furthermore, we evaluated ourapproach on our newly created dataset with 150 scenarios covering a wide rangeof complex tasks with missing objects, achieving a success rate of 79% on ourdataset.

In this work, we take on a novel perspective to investigateits capabilities in terms of quality- and aesthetics-awareness. To this end, wepropose Quality- and aesthetics-aware pretraining (QPT V2), the firstpretraining framework based on MIM that offers a unified solution to qualityand aesthetics assessment. To perceive the high-level semantics andfine-grained details, pretraining data is curated. To comprehensively encompassquality- and aesthetics-related factors, degradation is introduced. To capturemulti-scale quality and aesthetic information, model structure is modified.Extensive experimental results on 11 downstream benchmarks clearly show thesuperior performance of QPT V2 in comparison with current state-of-the-artapproaches and other pretraining paradigms.

Nevertheless, the absenceof detailed body information in skeletons restricts performance, while othermultimodal methods require substantial inference resources and are inefficientwhen using multimodal data during both training and inference stages. Toaddress this and fully harness the complementary multimodal features, wepropose a novel multi-modality co-learning (MMCL) framework by leveraging themultimodal large language models (LLMs) as auxiliary networks for efficientskeleton-based action recognition, which engages in multi-modality co-learningduring the training stage and keeps efficiency by employing only conciseskeletons in inference. Our MMCL framework primarily consists of two modules.First, the Feature Alignment Module (FAM) extracts rich RGB features from videoframes and aligns them with global skeleton features via contrastive learning.Second, the Feature Refinement Module (FRM) uses RGB images with temporalinformation and text instruction to generate instructive features based on thepowerful generalization of multimodal LLMs. These instructive text featureswill further refine the classification scores and the refined scores willenhance the model's robustness and generalization in a manner similar to softlabels. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and Northwestern-UCLAbenchmarks consistently verify the effectiveness of our MMCL, which outperformsthe existing skeleton-based action recognition methods. Meanwhile, experimentson UTD-MHAD and SYSU-Action datasets demonstrate the commendable generalizationof our MMCL in zero-shot and domain-adaptive action recognition.

Deep end-to-end trainingmethods incorporating phases of self-supervised and supervised learning areaccurate and adaptable to input data but self-supervised learning requires evenmore computational and memory resources than supervised learning, too high forcurrent embedded hardware. Conversely, unsupervised layer-by-layer training,such as Hebbian learning, is more compatible with existing hardware but doesnot integrate well with supervised learning. To address this, we propose amethod enabling networks or hardware designed for end-to-end supervisedlearning to also perform high-performance unsupervised learning by adding twosimple elements to the output layer: Winner-Take-All (WTA) selectivity andhomeostasis regularization. These mechanisms introduce a "self-defined target"for unlabeled data, allowing purely unsupervised training for bothfully-connected and convolutional layers using backpropagation or equilibriumpropagation on datasets like MNIST (up to 99.2%), Fashion-MNIST (up to 90.3%),and SVHN (up to 81.5%). We extend this method to semi-supervised learning,adjusting targets based on data type, achieving 96.6% accuracy with only 600labeled MNIST samples in a multi-layer perceptron.

However, the rapid development ofinternet protocols and encryption limits usable data availability. This paperaddresses the challenges of classifying encrypted internet traffic, focusing onthe scarcity of open-source datasets and limitations of existing ones. Wepropose two Data Augmentation (DA) techniques to synthetically generate databased on real samples: Average augmentation and MTU augmentation. Bothaugmentations are aimed to improve the performance of the classifier, each froma different perspective: The Average augmentation aims to increase dataset sizeby generating new synthetic samples, while the MTU augmentation enhancesclassifier robustness to varying Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs). Ourexperiments, conducted on two well-known academic datasets and a commercialdataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches in improving modelperformance and mitigating constraints associated with limited and homogeneousdatasets. Our findings underscore the potential of data augmentation inaddressing the challenges of modern internet traffic classification.Specifically, we show that our augmentation techniques significantly enhanceencrypted traffic classification models. This improvement can positively impactuser Quality of Experience (QoE) by more accurately classifying traffic asvideo streaming (e.g., YouTube) or chat (e.g., Google Chat). Additionally, itcan enhance Quality of Service (QoS) for file downloading activities (e.g.,Google Docs).</description><author>Yehonatan Zion, Porat Aharon, Ran Dubin, Amit Dvir, Chen Hajaj</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 14:49:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16539v1</guid></item><item><title>Quantifying the Role of Textual Predictability in Automatic Speech Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16537v1</link><description>A long-standing question in automatic speech recognition research is how toattribute errors to the ability of a model to model the acoustics, versus itsability to leverage higher-order context (lexicon, morphology, syntax,semantics).

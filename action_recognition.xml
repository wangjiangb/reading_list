While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)have been proposed for skeleton data represented as graphs, they suffer fromlimited receptive fields constrained by joint connectivity. To address thislimitation, recent advancements have introduced transformer-based methods.However, capturing correlations between all joints in all frames requiressubstantial memory resources. To alleviate this, we propose a novel approachcalled Skeletal-Temporal Transformer (SkateFormer) that partitions joints andframes based on different types of skeletal-temporal relation (Skate-Type) andperforms skeletal-temporal self-attention (Skate-MSA) within each partition. Wecategorize the key skeletal-temporal relations for action recognition into atotal of four distinct types. These types combine (i) two skeletal relationtypes based on physically neighboring and distant joints, and (ii) two temporalrelation types based on neighboring and distant frames. Through thispartition-specific attention strategy, our SkateFormer can selectively focus onkey joints and frames crucial for action recognition in an action-adaptivemanner with efficient computation. Extensive experiments on various benchmarkdatasets validate that our SkateFormer outperforms recent state-of-the-artmethods.</description><author>Jeonghyeok Do, Munchurl Kim</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 16:55:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09508v1</guid></item><item><title>SkelVIT: Consensus of Vision Transformers for a Lightweight Skeleton-Based Action Recognition System</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08094v2</link><description>Skeleton-based action recognition receives the attention of many researchersas it is robust to viewpoint and illumination changes, and its processing ismuch more efficient than the processing of video frames. With the emergence ofdeep learning models, it has become very popular to represent the skeleton datain pseudo-image form and apply CNN for action recognition. Thereafter, studiesconcentrated on finding effective methods for forming pseudo-images. Recently,attention networks, more specifically transformers have provided promisingresults in various vision problems. In this study, the effectiveness of VIT forskeleton-based action recognition is examined and its robustness on thepseudo-image representation scheme is investigated. To this end, a three-levelarchitecture, SkelVit is proposed, which forms a set of pseudo images, appliesa classifier on each of the representations, and combines their results to findthe final action class. The performance of SkelVit is examined thoroughly via aset of experiments. First, the sensitivity of the system to representation isinvestigated by comparing it with two of the state-of-the-art pseudo-imagerepresentation methods. Then, the classifiers of SkelVit are realized in twoexperimental setups by CNNs and VITs, and their performances are compared. Inthe final experimental setup, the contribution of combining classifiers isexamined by applying the model with a different number of classifiers.Experimental studies reveal that the proposed system with its lightweightrepresentation scheme achieves better results than the state-of-the-artmethods. It is also observed that the vision transformer is less sensitive tothe initial pseudo-image representation compared to CNN. Nevertheless, evenwith the vision transformer, the recognition performance can be furtherimproved by the consensus of classifiers.</description><author>Ozge Oztimur Karadag</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 07:20:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08094v2</guid></item><item><title>Learning Domain-Invariant Temporal Dynamics for Few-Shot Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12706v1</link><description>Few-shot action recognition aims at quickly adapting a pre-trained model tothe novel data with a distribution shift using only a limited number ofsamples. Key challenges include how to identify and leverage the transferableknowledge learned by the pre-trained model. Our central hypothesis is thattemporal invariance in the dynamic system between latent variables lends itselfto transferability (domain-invariance). We therefore propose DITeD, orDomain-Invariant Temporal Dynamics for knowledge transfer. To detect thetemporal invariance part, we propose a generative framework with a two-stagetraining strategy during pre-training. Specifically, we explicitly modelinvariant dynamics including temporal dynamic generation and transitions, andthe variant visual and domain encoders. Then we pre-train the model with theself-supervised signals to learn the representation. After that, we fix thewhole representation model and tune the classifier. During adaptation, we fixthe transferable temporal dynamics and update the image encoder. The efficacyof our approach is revealed by the superior accuracy of DITeD over leadingalternatives across standard few-shot action recognition datasets. Moreover, wevalidate that the learned temporal dynamic transition and temporal dynamicgeneration modules possess transferable qualities.</description><author>Yuke Li, Guangyi Chen, Ben Abramowitz, Stefano Anzellott, Donglai Wei</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 04:09:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12706v1</guid></item><item><title>Benchmarking Micro-action Recognition: Dataset, Methods, and Applications</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05234v1</link><description>Micro-action is an imperceptible non-verbal behaviour characterised bylow-intensity movement. It offers insights into the feelings and intentions ofindividuals and is important for human-oriented applications such as emotionrecognition and psychological assessment. However, the identification,differentiation, and understanding of micro-actions pose challenges due to theimperceptible and inaccessible nature of these subtle human behaviors ineveryday life. In this study, we innovatively collect a new micro-actiondataset designated as Micro-action-52 (MA-52), and propose a benchmark namedmicro-action network (MANet) for micro-action recognition (MAR) task. Uniquely,MA-52 provides the whole-body perspective including gestures, upper- andlower-limb movements, attempting to reveal comprehensive micro-action cues. Indetail, MA-52 contains 52 micro-action categories along with seven body partlabels, and encompasses a full array of realistic and natural micro-actions,accounting for 205 participants and 22,422 video instances collated from thepsychological interviews. Based on the proposed dataset, we assess MANet andother nine prevalent action recognition methods. MANet incorporates squeeze-andexcitation (SE) and temporal shift module (TSM) into the ResNet architecturefor modeling the spatiotemporal characteristics of micro-actions. Then ajoint-embedding loss is designed for semantic matching between video and actionlabels; the loss is used to better distinguish between visually similar yetdistinct micro-action categories. The extended application in emotionrecognition has demonstrated one of the important values of our proposeddataset and method. In the future, further exploration of human behaviour,emotion, and psychological assessment will be conducted in depth.

Posesare compact yet informative and can greatly benefit applications with limitedcompute budgets. However, poses alone offer an incomplete understanding ofactions, as they cannot fully capture objects and environments with whichhumans interact. To efficiently model hand-object interactions, we proposeHandFormer, a novel multimodal transformer. HandFormer combines 3D hand posesat a high temporal resolution for fine-grained motion modeling with sparselysampled RGB frames for encoding scene semantics. Observing the uniquecharacteristics of hand poses, we temporally factorize hand modeling andrepresent each joint by its short-term trajectories. This factorized poserepresentation combined with sparse RGB samples is remarkably efficient andachieves high accuracy. Unimodal HandFormer with only hand poses outperformsexisting skeleton-based methods at 5x fewer FLOPs. With RGB, we achieve newstate-of-the-art performance on Assembly101 and H2O with significantimprovements in egocentric action recognition.</description><author>Md Salman Shamil, Dibyadip Chatterjee, Fadime Sener, Shugao Ma, Angela Yao</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 19:52:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09805v1</guid></item><item><title>Leveraging Foundation Model Automatic Data Augmentation Strategies and Skeletal Points for Hands Action Recognition in Industrial Assembly Lines</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09056v1</link><description>On modern industrial assembly lines, many intelligent algorithms have beendeveloped to replace or supervise workers. However, we found that there werebottlenecks in both training datasets and real-time performance when deployingalgorithms on actual assembly line. Therefore, we developed a promisingstrategy for expanding industrial datasets, which utilized large models withstrong generalization abilities to achieve efficient, high-quality, andlarge-scale dataset expansion, solving the problem of insufficient andlow-quality industrial datasets. We also applied this strategy to video actionrecognition. We proposed a method of converting hand action recognitionproblems into hand skeletal trajectory classification problems, which solvedthe real-time performance problem of industrial algorithms. In the "handmovements during wire insertion" scenarios on the actual assembly line, theaccuracy of hand action recognition reached 98.8\%. We conducted detailedexperimental analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of themethod, and deployed the entire process on Midea's actual assembly line.</description><author>Liang Wu, X. -G.

However, precise temporal localization and annotation ofactivity sequences is time-consuming and the resulting labels are often noisy.If not effectively addressed, label noise negatively affects the model'straining, resulting in lower recognition quality. Despite its importance,addressing label noise for skeleton-based action recognition has beenoverlooked so far. In this study, we bridge this gap by implementing aframework that augments well-established skeleton-based human actionrecognition methods with label-denoising strategies from various research areasto serve as the initial benchmark. Observations reveal that these baselinesyield only marginal performance when dealing with sparse skeleton data.Consequently, we introduce a novel methodology, NoiseEraSAR, which integratesglobal sample selection, co-teaching, and Cross-Modal Mixture-of-Experts(CM-MOE) strategies, aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of label noise.Our proposed approach demonstrates better performance on the establishedbenchmark, setting new state-of-the-art standards.

The challenge lies in creating models that are bothprecise in their recognition capabilities and efficient enough for practicaluse. This study conducts an in-depth analysis of various deep learning modelsto address this challenge. Utilizing a subset of the UCF101 Videos dataset, wefocus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs), and Two-Stream ConvNets. The research reveals that while CNNseffectively capture spatial features and RNNs encode temporal sequences,Two-Stream ConvNets exhibit superior performance by integrating spatial andtemporal dimensions.

To alleviate these, we proposeto leverage text description generated from large language models (LLM) thatcontain high-level human knowledge, to guide feature learning, in aglobal-local-global way. Particularly, during training, we design $2$ promptsto gain global and local text descriptions of each action from an LLM. We firstutilize the global text description to guide the skeleton encoder focus oninformative joints (i.e.,global-to-local). Then we build non-local interactionbetween local text and joint features, to form the final global representation(i.e., local-to-global). To mitigate the asymmetry issue between the trainingand inference phases, we further design a dual-branch architecture that allowsthe model to perform novel class inference without any text input, also makingthe additional inference cost neglectable compared with the base skeletonencoder. Extensive experiments on three different benchmarks show that CrossGLGconsistently outperforms the existing SOTA methods with large margins, and theinference cost (model size) is only $2.8$\% than the previous SOTA. CrossGLGcan also serve as a plug-and-play module that can substantially enhance theperformance of different SOTA skeleton encoders with a neglectable cost duringinference. The source code will be released soon.</description><author>Tingbing Yan, Wenzheng Zeng, Yang Xiao, Xingyu Tong, Bo Tan, Zhiwen Fang, Zhiguo Cao, Joey Tianyi Zhou</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 08:51:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10082v1</guid></item><item><title>TikTokActions: A TikTok-Derived Video Dataset for Human Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08875v1</link><description>The increasing variety and quantity of tagged multimedia content on platformssuch as TikTok provides an opportunity to advance computer vision modeling. Wehave curated a distinctive dataset of 283,582 unique video clips categorizedunder 386 hashtags relating to modern human actions. We release this dataset asa valuable resource for building domain-specific foundation models for humanmovement modeling tasks such as action recognition. To validate this dataset,which we name TikTokActions, we perform two sets of experiments. First, wepretrain the state-of-the-art VideoMAEv2 with a ViT-base backbone onTikTokActions subset, and then fine-tune and evaluate on popular datasets suchas UCF101 and the HMDB51. We find that the performance of the model pre-trainedusing our Tik-Tok dataset is comparable to models trained on larger actionrecognition datasets (95.3% on UCF101 and 53.24% on HMDB51). Furthermore, ourinvestigation into the relationship between pre-training dataset size andfine-tuning performance reveals that beyond a certain threshold, theincremental benefit of larger training sets diminishes.

However, most existing methods follow an "adaptthen align" paradigm, which adapts pre-trained image encoders to modelvideo-level representations and utilizes one-hot or text embedding of theaction labels for supervision. This paradigm overlooks the challenge of mappingfrom static images to complicated activity concepts. In this paper, we proposea novel "Align before Adapt" (ALT) paradigm. Prior to adapting to videorepresentation learning, we exploit the entity-to-region alignments for eachframe. The alignments are fulfilled by matching the region-aware imageembeddings to an offline-constructed text corpus. With the aligned entities, wefeed their text embeddings to a transformer-based video adapter as the queries,which can help extract the semantics of the most important entities from avideo to a vector. This paradigm reuses the visual-language alignment of VLPduring adaptation and tries to explain an action by the underlying entities.This helps understand actions by bridging the gap with complex activitysemantics, particularly when facing unfamiliar or unseen categories. ALTdemonstrates competitive performance while maintaining remarkably lowcomputational costs. In fully supervised experiments, it achieves 88.1% top-1accuracy on Kinetics-400 with only 4947 GFLOPs. Moreover, ALT outperforms theprevious state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and few-shot experiments,emphasizing its superior generalizability across various learning scenarios.</description><author>Yifei Chen, Dapeng Chen, Ruijin Liu, Sai Zhou, Wenyuan Xue, Wei Peng</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 18:17:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15619v2</guid></item><item><title>Density-Guided Label Smoothing for Temporal Localization of Driving Actions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06616v1</link><description>Temporal localization of driving actions plays a crucial role in advanceddriver-assistance systems and naturalistic driving studies.

However, it isrelatively easy to annotate sequence-level labels. This kind of coarseannotations are called as weak labels. However, training a multi-viewvideo-based action recognition model with weak labels for frame-levelperception is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel learningframework, where the weak labels are first used to train a multi-viewvideo-based base model, which is subsequently used for downstream frame-levelperception tasks. The base model is trained to obtain individual latentembeddings for each view in the multi-view input. For training the model usingthe weak labels, we propose a novel latent loss function. We also propose amodel that uses the view-specific latent embeddings for downstream frame-levelaction recognition and detection tasks. The proposed framework is evaluatedusing the MM Office dataset by comparing several baseline algorithms. Theresults show that the proposed base model is effectively trained using weaklabels and the latent embeddings help the downstream models improve accuracy.</description><author>Vijay John, Yasutomo Kawanishi</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 10:47:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11616v1</guid></item><item><title>Human Goal Recognition as Bayesian Inference: Investigating the Impact of Actions, Timing, and Goal Solvability</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10510v1</link><description>Goal recognition is a fundamental cognitive process that enables individualsto infer intentions based on available cues.

While domain experts often craft dataset-specificGCN-based methods, their applicability beyond this specific context is severelylimited.

We provide asystematic comparison of Mamba-ND with several other alternatives, based onprior multi-dimensional extensions such as Bi-directional LSTMs and S4ND.Empirically, we show that Mamba-ND demonstrates performance competitive withthe state-of-the-art on a variety of multi-dimensional benchmarks, includingImageNet-1K classification, HMDB-51 action recognition, and ERA5 weatherforecasting.</description><author>Shufan Li, Harkanwar Singh, Aditya Grover</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 17:16:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05892v3</guid></item><item><title>Video Relationship Detection Using Mixture of Experts</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03994v1</link><description>Machine comprehension of visual information from images and videos by neuralnetworks faces two primary challenges. Firstly, there exists a computationaland inference gap in connecting vision and language, making it difficult toaccurately determine which object a given agent acts on and represent itthrough language. Secondly, classifiers trained by a single, monolithic neuralnetwork often lack stability and generalization. To overcome these challenges,we introduce MoE-VRD, a novel approach to visual relationship detectionutilizing a mixture of experts. MoE-VRD identifies language triplets in theform of &lt; subject, predicate, object&gt; tuples to extract relationships fromvisual processing. Leveraging recent advancements in visual relationshipdetection, MoE-VRD addresses the requirement for action recognition inestablishing relationships between subjects (acting) and objects (being actedupon). In contrast to single monolithic networks, MoE-VRD employs multiplesmall models as experts, whose outputs are aggregated. Each expert in MoE-VRDspecializes in visual relationship learning and object tagging. By utilizing asparsely-gated mixture of experts, MoE-VRD enables conditional computation andsignificantly enhances neural network capacity without increasing computationalcomplexity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the conditionalcomputation capabilities and scalability of the mixture-of-experts approachlead to superior performance in visual relationship detection compared tostate-of-the-art methods.</description><author>Ala Shaabana, Zahra Gharaee, Paul Fieguth</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 19:08:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03994v1</guid></item><item><title>Attention Prompt Tuning: Parameter-efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Models for Spatiotemporal Modeling</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06978v1</link><description>In this paper, we introduce Attention Prompt Tuning (APT) - a computationallyefficient variant of prompt tuning for video-based applications such as actionrecognition. Prompt tuning approaches involve injecting a set of learnableprompts along with data tokens during fine-tuning while keeping the backbonefrozen. This approach greatly reduces the number of learnable parameterscompared to full tuning. For image-based downstream tasks, normally a couple oflearnable prompts achieve results close to those of full tuning. However,videos, which contain more complex spatiotemporal information, require hundredsof tunable prompts to achieve reasonably good results. This reduces theparameter efficiency observed in images and significantly increases latency andthe number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) during inference. To tacklethese issues, we directly inject the prompts into the keys and values of thenon-local attention mechanism within the transformer block. Additionally, weintroduce a novel prompt reparameterization technique to make APT more robustagainst hyperparameter selection. The proposed APT approach greatly reduces thenumber of FLOPs and latency while achieving a significant performance boostover the existing parameter-efficient tuning methods on UCF101, HMDB51, andSSv2 datasets for action recognition.

Existing deeppoint cloud sequence modeling approaches imitate the mature 2D video learningmechanisms by developing complex spatio-temporal point neighbor grouping andfeature aggregation schemes, often resulting in methods lacking effectiveness,efficiency, and expressive power. In this paper, we propose a novel genericrepresentation called \textit{Structured Point Cloud Videos} (SPCVs).Intuitively, by leveraging the fact that 3D geometric shapes are essentially 2Dmanifolds, SPCV re-organizes a point cloud sequence as a 2D video with spatialsmoothness and temporal consistency, where the pixel values correspond to the3D coordinates of points. The structured nature of our SPCV representationallows for the seamless adaptation of well-established 2D image/videotechniques, enabling efficient and effective processing and analysis of 3Dpoint cloud sequences. To achieve such re-organization, we design aself-supervised learning pipeline that is geometrically regularized and drivenby self-reconstructive and deformation field learning objectives. Additionally,we construct SPCV-based frameworks for both low-level and high-level 3D pointcloud sequence processing and analysis tasks, including action recognition,temporal interpolation, and compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate theversatility and superiority of the proposed SPCV, which has the potential tooffer new possibilities for deep learning on unstructured 3D point cloudsequences.

To effectively use LLMs for visual generation, one crucialcomponent is the visual tokenizer that maps pixel-space inputs to discretetokens appropriate for LLM learning. In this paper, we introduce MAGVIT-v2, avideo tokenizer designed to generate concise and expressive tokens for bothvideos and images using a common token vocabulary. Equipped with this newtokenizer, we show that LLMs outperform diffusion models on standard image andvideo generation benchmarks including ImageNet and Kinetics. In addition, wedemonstrate that our tokenizer surpasses the previously top-performing videotokenizer on two more tasks: (1) video compression comparable to thenext-generation video codec (VCC) according to human evaluations, and (2)learning effective representations for action recognition tasks.</description><author>Lijun Yu, José Lezama, Nitesh B.

However, a persistent and significant challenge within this field isthe accurate prediction of human poses under conditions of severe occlusion.Traditional image-based estimators struggle with heavy occlusions due to a lackof temporal context, resulting in inconsistent predictions. While video-basedmodels benefit from processing temporal data, they encounter limitations whenfaced with prolonged occlusions that extend over multiple frames. Thischallenge arises because these models struggle to generalize beyond theirtraining datasets, and the variety of occlusions is hard to capture in thetraining data. Addressing these challenges, we propose STRIDE (Single-videobased TempoRally contInuous occlusion Robust 3D Pose Estimation), a novelTest-Time Training (TTT) approach to fit a human motion prior for each video.This approach specifically handles occlusions that were not encountered duringthe model's training. By employing STRIDE, we can refine a sequence of noisyinitial pose estimates into accurate, temporally coherent poses during testtime, effectively overcoming the limitations of prior methods. Our frameworkdemonstrates flexibility by being model-agnostic, allowing us to use anyoff-the-shelf 3D pose estimation method for improving robustness and temporalconsistency. We validate STRIDE's efficacy through comprehensive experiments onchallenging datasets like Occluded Human3.6M, Human3.6M, and OCMotion, where itnot only outperforms existing single-image and video-based pose estimationmodels but also showcases superior handling of substantial occlusions,achieving fast, robust, accurate, and temporally consistent 3D pose estimates.</description><author>Rohit Lal, Saketh Bachu, Yash Garg, Arindam Dutta, Calvin-Khang Ta, Dripta S.

This study focuses on monitoring students' emotionsin the classroom as an indicator of their engagement and proposes an approachto address this issue. The impact of different facial parts on the performanceof an emotional recognition model is evaluated through experimentation. To testthe proposed model under partial occlusion, an artificially occluded dataset isintroduced. The novelty of this work lies in the proposal of an occlusion-awarearchitecture for facial action units (AUs) extraction, which employs attentionmechanism and adaptive feature learning. The AUs can be used later to classifyfacial expressions in classroom settings. This research paper's findings provide valuable insights into handlingocclusion in analyzing facial images for emotional engagement analysis.

Recent studies have extended Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) to manifolds, and concomitantly, normalization techniques have also beenadapted to several manifolds, referred to as Riemannian normalization.Nonetheless, most of the existing Riemannian normalization methods have beenderived in an ad hoc manner and only apply to specific manifolds. This paperestablishes a unified framework for Riemannian Batch Normalization (RBN)techniques on Lie groups. Our framework offers the theoretical guarantee ofcontrolling both the Riemannian mean and variance. Empirically, we focus onSymmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifolds, which possess three distinct typesof Lie group structures. Using the deformation concept, we generalize theexisting Lie groups on SPD manifolds into three families of parameterized Liegroups. Specific normalization layers induced by these Lie groups are thenproposed for SPD neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ourapproach through three sets of experiments: radar recognition, human actionrecognition, and electroencephalography (EEG) classification.

This study aims toinvestigate the correlation between two continuous sensor streams, pupildiameter as an indicator of cognitive workload and FACTs with deep learning asan indicator of emotional arousal (RQ 1a), specifically for epochs of high,medium, and low arousal (RQ 1b). Furthermore, the time lag between emotionalarousal and pupil diameter data will be analyzed (RQ 2). 28 participants workedon three cognitively demanding and emotionally engaging everyday moral dilemmaswhile eye-tracking and emotion recognition data were collected. The data werepre-processed in Phyton (synchronization, blink control, downsampling) andanalyzed using correlation analysis and Granger causality tests. The resultsshow negative and statistically significant correlations between the datastreams for emotional arousal and pupil diameter. However, the correlation isnegative and significant only for epochs of high arousal, while positive butnon-significant relationships were found for epochs of medium or low arousal.The average time lag for the relationship between arousal and pupil diameterwas 2.8 ms. In contrast to previous findings without a multimodal approachsuggesting a positive correlation between the constructs, the resultscontribute to the state of research by highlighting the importance ofmultimodal data validation and research on convergent vagility.

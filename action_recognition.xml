Single-view action recognition faces limitations due to itsreliance on a single viewpoint. In contrast, multi-view approaches capturecomplementary information from various viewpoints for improved accuracy.Recently, event cameras have emerged as innovative bio-inspired sensors,leading to advancements in event-based action recognition. However, existingworks predominantly focus on single-view scenarios, leaving a gap in multi-viewevent data exploitation, particularly in challenges like information deficitand semantic misalignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce HyperMV, amulti-view event-based action recognition framework. HyperMV converts discreteevent data into frame-like representations and extracts view-related featuresusing a shared convolutional network. By treating segments as vertices andconstructing hyperedges using rule-based and KNN-based strategies, a multi-viewhypergraph neural network that captures relationships across viewpoint andtemporal features is established. The vertex attention hypergraph propagationis also introduced for enhanced feature fusion. To prompt research in thisarea, we present the largest multi-view event-based action dataset$\text{THU}^{\text{MV-EACT}}\text{-50}$, comprising 50 actions from 6viewpoints, which surpasses existing datasets by over tenfold. Experimentalresults show that HyperMV significantly outperforms baselines in bothcross-subject and cross-view scenarios, and also exceeds the state-of-the-artsin frame-based multi-view action recognition.</description><author>Yue Gao, Jiaxuan Lu, Siqi Li, Yipeng Li, Shaoyi Du</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2024 12:17:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19316v1</guid></item><item><title>SkateFormer: Skeletal-Temporal Transformer for Human Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09508v1</link><description>Skeleton-based action recognition, which classifies human actions based onthe coordinates of joints and their connectivity within skeleton data, iswidely utilized in various scenarios. While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)have been proposed for skeleton data represented as graphs, they suffer fromlimited receptive fields constrained by joint connectivity. To address thislimitation, recent advancements have introduced transformer-based methods.However, capturing correlations between all joints in all frames requiressubstantial memory resources. To alleviate this, we propose a novel approachcalled Skeletal-Temporal Transformer (SkateFormer) that partitions joints andframes based on different types of skeletal-temporal relation (Skate-Type) andperforms skeletal-temporal self-attention (Skate-MSA) within each partition. Wecategorize the key skeletal-temporal relations for action recognition into atotal of four distinct types. These types combine (i) two skeletal relationtypes based on physically neighboring and distant joints, and (ii) two temporalrelation types based on neighboring and distant frames. Through thispartition-specific attention strategy, our SkateFormer can selectively focus onkey joints and frames crucial for action recognition in an action-adaptivemanner with efficient computation. Extensive experiments on various benchmarkdatasets validate that our SkateFormer outperforms recent state-of-the-artmethods.</description><author>Jeonghyeok Do, Munchurl Kim</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 16:55:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09508v1</guid></item><item><title>ActNetFormer: Transformer-ResNet Hybrid Method for Semi-Supervised Action Recognition in Videos</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06243v1</link><description>Human action or activity recognition in videos is a fundamental task incomputer vision with applications in surveillance and monitoring, self-drivingcars, sports analytics, human-robot interaction and many more. Traditionalsupervised methods require large annotated datasets for training, which areexpensive and time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes a novel approachusing Cross-Architecture Pseudo-Labeling with contrastive learning forsemi-supervised action recognition. Our framework leverages both labeled andunlabelled data to robustly learn action representations in videos, combiningpseudo-labeling with contrastive learning for effective learning from bothtypes of samples. We introduce a novel cross-architecture approach where 3DConvolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) and video transformers (VIT) areutilised to capture different aspects of action representations; hence we callit ActNetFormer. The 3D CNNs excel at capturing spatial features and localdependencies in the temporal domain, while VIT excels at capturing long-rangedependencies across frames. By integrating these complementary architectureswithin the ActNetFormer framework, our approach can effectively capture bothlocal and global contextual information of an action. This comprehensiverepresentation learning enables the model to achieve better performance insemi-supervised action recognition tasks by leveraging the strengths of each ofthese architectures. Experimental results on standard action recognitiondatasets demonstrate that our approach performs better than the existingmethods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only a fraction of labeleddata.

While plain Transformershave been attempted for this task, they still fall short compared to thecurrent leading methods, which are rooted in Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) due to the absence of structural priors. Recently, a novel selectivestate space model, Mamba, has surfaced as a compelling alternative to theattention mechanism in Transformers, offering efficient modeling of longsequences. In this work, to the utmost extent of our awareness, we present thefirst SAR framework incorporating Mamba. Each fundamental block of our modeladopts a novel U-ShiftGCN architecture with Mamba as its core component. Theencoder segment of the U-ShiftGCN is devised to extract spatial features fromthe skeletal data using downsampling vanilla Shift S-GCN blocks. These spatialfeatures then undergo intermediate temporal modeling facilitated by the Mambablock before progressing to the encoder section, which comprises vanillaupsampling Shift S-GCN blocks. Additionally, a Shift T-GCN (ShiftTCN) temporalmodeling unit is employed before the exit of each fundamental block to refinetemporal representations. This particular integration of downsampling spatial,intermediate temporal, upsampling spatial, and ultimate temporal subunitsyields promising results for skeleton action recognition. We dub the resultingmodel \textbf{Simba}, which attains state-of-the-art performance across threewell-known benchmark skeleton action recognition datasets: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D120, and Northwestern-UCLA. Interestingly, U-ShiftGCN (Simba withoutIntermediate Mamba Block) by itself is capable of performing reasonably welland surpasses our baseline.</description><author>Soumyabrata Chaudhuri, Saumik Bhattacharya</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 12:07:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07645v1</guid></item><item><title>SkelVIT: Consensus of Vision Transformers for a Lightweight Skeleton-Based Action Recognition System</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08094v2</link><description>Skeleton-based action recognition receives the attention of many researchersas it is robust to viewpoint and illumination changes, and its processing ismuch more efficient than the processing of video frames. With the emergence ofdeep learning models, it has become very popular to represent the skeleton datain pseudo-image form and apply CNN for action recognition. Thereafter, studiesconcentrated on finding effective methods for forming pseudo-images. Recently,attention networks, more specifically transformers have provided promisingresults in various vision problems. In this study, the effectiveness of VIT forskeleton-based action recognition is examined and its robustness on thepseudo-image representation scheme is investigated. To this end, a three-levelarchitecture, SkelVit is proposed, which forms a set of pseudo images, appliesa classifier on each of the representations, and combines their results to findthe final action class. The performance of SkelVit is examined thoroughly via aset of experiments. First, the sensitivity of the system to representation isinvestigated by comparing it with two of the state-of-the-art pseudo-imagerepresentation methods. Then, the classifiers of SkelVit are realized in twoexperimental setups by CNNs and VITs, and their performances are compared. Inthe final experimental setup, the contribution of combining classifiers isexamined by applying the model with a different number of classifiers.Experimental studies reveal that the proposed system with its lightweightrepresentation scheme achieves better results than the state-of-the-artmethods. It is also observed that the vision transformer is less sensitive tothe initial pseudo-image representation compared to CNN. Nevertheless, evenwith the vision transformer, the recognition performance can be furtherimproved by the consensus of classifiers.</description><author>Ozge Oztimur Karadag</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 07:20:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08094v2</guid></item><item><title>Emotion Recognition from the perspective of Activity Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16263v1</link><description>Applications of an efficient emotion recognition system can be found inseveral domains such as medicine, driver fatigue surveillance, social robotics,and human-computer interaction. Appraising human emotional states, behaviors,and reactions displayed in real-world settings can be accomplished using latentcontinuous dimensions. Continuous dimensional models of human affect, such asthose based on valence and arousal are more accurate in describing a broadrange of spontaneous everyday emotions than more traditional models of discretestereotypical emotion categories (e.g. happiness, surprise). Most of the priorwork on estimating valence and arousal considers laboratory settings and acteddata. But, for emotion recognition systems to be deployed and integrated intoreal-world mobile and computing devices, we need to consider data collected inthe world. Action recognition is a domain of Computer Vision that involvescapturing complementary information on appearance from still frames and motionbetween frames. In this paper, we treat emotion recognition from theperspective of action recognition by exploring the application of deep learningarchitectures specifically designed for action recognition, for continuousaffect recognition. We propose a novel three-stream end-to-end deep learningregression pipeline with an attention mechanism, which is an ensemble designbased on sub-modules of multiple state-of-the-art action recognition systems.The pipeline constitutes a novel data pre-processing approach with a spatialself-attention mechanism to extract keyframes. The optical flow ofhigh-attention regions of the face is extracted to capture temporal context.AFEW-VA in-the-wild dataset has been used to conduct comparative experiments.Quantitative analysis shows that the proposed model outperforms multiplestandard baselines of both emotion recognition and action recognition models.</description><author>Savinay Nagendra, Prapti Panigrahi</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2024 19:53:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16263v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning Domain-Invariant Temporal Dynamics for Few-Shot Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12706v1</link><description>Few-shot action recognition aims at quickly adapting a pre-trained model tothe novel data with a distribution shift using only a limited number ofsamples. Key challenges include how to identify and leverage the transferableknowledge learned by the pre-trained model. Our central hypothesis is thattemporal invariance in the dynamic system between latent variables lends itselfto transferability (domain-invariance). We therefore propose DITeD, orDomain-Invariant Temporal Dynamics for knowledge transfer. To detect thetemporal invariance part, we propose a generative framework with a two-stagetraining strategy during pre-training. Specifically, we explicitly modelinvariant dynamics including temporal dynamic generation and transitions, andthe variant visual and domain encoders. Then we pre-train the model with theself-supervised signals to learn the representation. After that, we fix thewhole representation model and tune the classifier. During adaptation, we fixthe transferable temporal dynamics and update the image encoder. The efficacyof our approach is revealed by the superior accuracy of DITeD over leadingalternatives across standard few-shot action recognition datasets. Moreover, wevalidate that the learned temporal dynamic transition and temporal dynamicgeneration modules possess transferable qualities.</description><author>Yuke Li, Guangyi Chen, Ben Abramowitz, Stefano Anzellott, Donglai Wei</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 04:09:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12706v1</guid></item><item><title>Fine-Grained Side Information Guided Dual-Prompts for Zero-Shot Skeleton Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07487v1</link><description>Skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition aims to recognize unknown humanactions based on the learned priors of the known skeleton-based actions and asemantic descriptor space shared by both known and unknown categories. However,previous works focus on establishing the bridges between the known skeletonrepresentation space and semantic descriptions space at the coarse-grainedlevel for recognizing unknown action categories, ignoring the fine-grainedalignment of these two spaces, resulting in suboptimal performance indistinguishing high-similarity action categories. To address these challenges,we propose a novel method via Side information and dual-prompts learning forskeleton-based zero-shot action recognition (STAR) at the fine-grained level.Specifically, 1) we decompose the skeleton into several parts based on itstopology structure and introduce the side information concerning multi-partdescriptions of human body movements for alignment between the skeleton and thesemantic space at the fine-grained level; 2) we design the visual-attribute andsemantic-part prompts to improve the intra-class compactness within theskeleton space and inter-class separability within the semantic space,respectively, to distinguish the high-similarity actions.

It offers insights into the feelings and intentions ofindividuals and is important for human-oriented applications such as emotionrecognition and psychological assessment. However, the identification,differentiation, and understanding of micro-actions pose challenges due to theimperceptible and inaccessible nature of these subtle human behaviors ineveryday life. In this study, we innovatively collect a new micro-actiondataset designated as Micro-action-52 (MA-52), and propose a benchmark namedmicro-action network (MANet) for micro-action recognition (MAR) task. Uniquely,MA-52 provides the whole-body perspective including gestures, upper- andlower-limb movements, attempting to reveal comprehensive micro-action cues. Indetail, MA-52 contains 52 micro-action categories along with seven body partlabels, and encompasses a full array of realistic and natural micro-actions,accounting for 205 participants and 22,422 video instances collated from thepsychological interviews. Based on the proposed dataset, we assess MANet andother nine prevalent action recognition methods. MANet incorporates squeeze-andexcitation (SE) and temporal shift module (TSM) into the ResNet architecturefor modeling the spatiotemporal characteristics of micro-actions. Then ajoint-embedding loss is designed for semantic matching between video and actionlabels; the loss is used to better distinguish between visually similar yetdistinct micro-action categories. The extended application in emotionrecognition has demonstrated one of the important values of our proposeddataset and method. In the future, further exploration of human behaviour,emotion, and psychological assessment will be conducted in depth.

Existing approaches often suffer fromissues arising through obfuscation being applied globally and a lack ofinterpretability. Global obfuscation hides privacy sensitive regions, but alsocontextual regions important for action recognition. Lack of interpretabilityerodes trust in these new technologies. We highlight the limitations of currentparadigms and propose a solution: Human selected privacy templates that yieldinterpretability by design, an obfuscation scheme that selectively hidesattributes and also induces temporal consistency, which is important in actionrecognition. Our approach is architecture agnostic and directly modifies inputimagery, while existing approaches generally require architecture training. Ourapproach offers more flexibility, as no retraining is required, and outperformsalternatives on three widely used datasets.</description><author>Filip Ilic, He Zhao, Thomas Pock, Richard P.

Posesare compact yet informative and can greatly benefit applications with limitedcompute budgets. However, poses alone offer an incomplete understanding ofactions, as they cannot fully capture objects and environments with whichhumans interact. To efficiently model hand-object interactions, we proposeHandFormer, a novel multimodal transformer. HandFormer combines 3D hand posesat a high temporal resolution for fine-grained motion modeling with sparselysampled RGB frames for encoding scene semantics. Observing the uniquecharacteristics of hand poses, we temporally factorize hand modeling andrepresent each joint by its short-term trajectories. This factorized poserepresentation combined with sparse RGB samples is remarkably efficient andachieves high accuracy. Unimodal HandFormer with only hand poses outperformsexisting skeleton-based methods at 5x fewer FLOPs. With RGB, we achieve newstate-of-the-art performance on Assembly101 and H2O with significantimprovements in egocentric action recognition.</description><author>Md Salman Shamil, Dibyadip Chatterjee, Fadime Sener, Shugao Ma, Angela Yao</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 19:52:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09805v1</guid></item><item><title>Leveraging Foundation Model Automatic Data Augmentation Strategies and Skeletal Points for Hands Action Recognition in Industrial Assembly Lines</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09056v1</link><description>On modern industrial assembly lines, many intelligent algorithms have beendeveloped to replace or supervise workers.

The recent state-of-the-art models for SARare primarily based on graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs), which arepowerful in extracting the spatial information of skeleton data. However, it isyet clear that such GCN-based models can effectively capture the temporaldynamics of human action sequences. To this end, we propose the DevLSTM module,which exploits the path development -- a principled and parsimoniousrepresentation for sequential data by leveraging the Lie group structure. Thepath development, originated from Rough path theory, can effectively capturethe order of events in high-dimensional stream data with massive dimensionreduction and consequently enhance the LSTM module substantially. Our proposedG-DevLSTM module can be conveniently plugged into the temporal graph,complementing existing advanced GCN-based models.

However, current research is hinderedby 1) the difficulty in processing events because of their prolonged durationand dynamic actions with complex and ambiguous semantics and 2) the redundantaction depiction of the event frame representation with fixed stacks. We findlanguage naturally conveys abundant semantic information, rendering itstunningly superior in reducing semantic uncertainty. In light of this, wepropose ExACT, a novel approach that, for the first time, tackles event-basedaction recognition from a cross-modal conceptualizing perspective. Our ExACTbrings two technical contributions. Firstly, we propose an adaptivefine-grained event (AFE) representation to adaptively filter out the repeatedevents for the stationary objects while preserving dynamic ones. This subtlyenhances the performance of ExACT without extra computational cost. Then, wepropose a conceptual reasoning-based uncertainty estimation module, whichsimulates the recognition process to enrich the semantic representation. Inparticular, conceptual reasoning builds the temporal relation based on theaction semantics, and uncertainty estimation tackles the semantic uncertaintyof actions based on the distributional representation.

Tosolve these problems, we propose a novel Spatial Topology Gating Unit (STGU),an MLP-based variant without extra priors, to capture the co-occurrencetopology features that encode the spatial dependency across all joints. InSTGU, to learn the point-wise topology features, a new gate-based featureinteraction mechanism is introduced to activate the features point-to-point bythe attention map generated from the input sample. Based on the STGU, wepropose the first MLP-based model, SiT-MLP, for skeleton-based actionrecognition in this work. Compared with previous methods on three large-scaledatasets, SiT-MLP achieves competitive performance. In addition, SiT-MLPreduces the parameters significantly with favorable results.

To alleviate these, we proposeto leverage text description generated from large language models (LLM) thatcontain high-level human knowledge, to guide feature learning, in aglobal-local-global way. Particularly, during training, we design $2$ promptsto gain global and local text descriptions of each action from an LLM. We firstutilize the global text description to guide the skeleton encoder focus oninformative joints (i.e.,global-to-local). Then we build non-local interactionbetween local text and joint features, to form the final global representation(i.e., local-to-global). To mitigate the asymmetry issue between the trainingand inference phases, we further design a dual-branch architecture that allowsthe model to perform novel class inference without any text input, also makingthe additional inference cost neglectable compared with the base skeletonencoder. Extensive experiments on three different benchmarks show that CrossGLGconsistently outperforms the existing SOTA methods with large margins, and theinference cost (model size) is only $2.8$\% than the previous SOTA. CrossGLGcan also serve as a plug-and-play module that can substantially enhance theperformance of different SOTA skeleton encoders with a neglectable cost duringinference. The source code will be released soon.</description><author>Tingbing Yan, Wenzheng Zeng, Yang Xiao, Xingyu Tong, Bo Tan, Zhiwen Fang, Zhiguo Cao, Joey Tianyi Zhou</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 08:51:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10082v1</guid></item><item><title>Leveraging YOLO-World and GPT-4V LMMs for Zero-Shot Person Detection and Action Recognition in Drone Imagery</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01571v1</link><description>In this article, we explore the potential of zero-shot Large MultimodalModels (LMMs) in the domain of drone perception.

We find that the performance of the model pre-trainedusing our Tik-Tok dataset is comparable to models trained on larger actionrecognition datasets (95.3% on UCF101 and 53.24% on HMDB51). Furthermore, ourinvestigation into the relationship between pre-training dataset size andfine-tuning performance reveals that beyond a certain threshold, theincremental benefit of larger training sets diminishes.

However, most existing methods follow an "adaptthen align" paradigm, which adapts pre-trained image encoders to modelvideo-level representations and utilizes one-hot or text embedding of theaction labels for supervision. This paradigm overlooks the challenge of mappingfrom static images to complicated activity concepts. In this paper, we proposea novel "Align before Adapt" (ALT) paradigm. Prior to adapting to videorepresentation learning, we exploit the entity-to-region alignments for eachframe. The alignments are fulfilled by matching the region-aware imageembeddings to an offline-constructed text corpus. With the aligned entities, wefeed their text embeddings to a transformer-based video adapter as the queries,which can help extract the semantics of the most important entities from avideo to a vector. This paradigm reuses the visual-language alignment of VLPduring adaptation and tries to explain an action by the underlying entities.This helps understand actions by bridging the gap with complex activitysemantics, particularly when facing unfamiliar or unseen categories. ALTdemonstrates competitive performance while maintaining remarkably lowcomputational costs. In fully supervised experiments, it achieves 88.1% top-1accuracy on Kinetics-400 with only 4947 GFLOPs. Moreover, ALT outperforms theprevious state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and few-shot experiments,emphasizing its superior generalizability across various learning scenarios.</description><author>Yifei Chen, Dapeng Chen, Ruijin Liu, Sai Zhou, Wenyuan Xue, Wei Peng</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 18:17:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15619v2</guid></item><item><title>MVSA-Net: Multi-View State-Action Recognition for Robust and Deployable Trajectory Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08393v3</link><description>The learn-from-observation (LfO) paradigm is a human-inspired mode for arobot to learn to perform a task simply by watching it being performed. LfO canfacilitate robot integration on factory floors by minimizing disruption andreducing tedious programming. A key component of the LfO pipeline is atransformation of the depth camera frames to the corresponding task state andaction pairs, which are then relayed to learning techniques such as imitationor inverse reinforcement learning for understanding the task parameters. Whileseveral existing computer vision models analyze videos for activityrecognition, SA-Net specifically targets robotic LfO from RGB-D data. However,SA-Net and many other models analyze frame data captured from a singleviewpoint. Their analysis is therefore highly sensitive to occlusions of theobserved task, which are frequent in deployments. An obvious way of reducingocclusions is to simultaneously observe the task from multiple viewpoints andsynchronously fuse the multiple streams in the model. Toward this, we presentmulti-view SA-Net, which generalizes the SA-Net model to allow the perceptionof multiple viewpoints of the task activity, integrate them, and betterrecognize the state and action in each frame. Performance evaluations on twodistinct domains establish that MVSA-Net recognizes the state-action pairsunder occlusion more accurately compared to single-view MVSA-Net and otherbaselines. Our ablation studies further evaluate its performance underdifferent ambient conditions and establish the contribution of the architecturecomponents. As such, MVSA-Net offers a significantly more robust and deployablestate-action trajectory generation compared to previous methods.</description><author>Ehsan Asali, Prashant Doshi, Jin Sun</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 03:57:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08393v3</guid></item><item><title>Density-Guided Label Smoothing for Temporal Localization of Driving Actions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06616v1</link><description>Temporal localization of driving actions plays a crucial role in advanceddriver-assistance systems and naturalistic driving studies.

Data augmentation is a simple but efficient methodto alleviate overfitting and improve the generalization ability of neuralnetworks, and saliency-based augmentation methods are proven to be effective inthe image processing field. However, there is no approach available forextracting saliency maps from SNNs. Therefore, for the first time, we presentSpiking Layer-Time-wise Relevance Propagation rule (SLTRP) and SpikingLayer-wise Relevance Propagation rule (SLRP) in order for SNN to generatestable and accurate CAMs and saliency maps. Based on this, we propose EventRPG,which leverages relevance propagation on the spiking neural network for moreefficient augmentation. Our proposed method has been evaluated on several SNNstructures, achieving state-of-the-art performance in object recognition tasksincluding N-Caltech101, CIFAR10-DVS, with accuracies of 85.62% and 85.55%, aswell as action recognition task SL-Animals with an accuracy of 91.59%.

HAR has gained attention due to advances in deep learning, increaseddata availability, and enhanced computational capabilities. At the same time,GCNs have shown promising results in modeling relationships between body keypoints in a skeletal graph. While domain experts often craft dataset-specificGCN-based methods, their applicability beyond this specific context is severelylimited. AutoGCN seeks to address this limitation by simultaneously searchingfor the ideal hyperparameters and architecture combination within a versatilesearch space using a reinforcement controller while balancing optimalexploration and exploitation behavior with a knowledge reservoir during thesearch process. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale datasetsfocused on skeleton-based action recognition to assess the proposed algorithm'sperformance. Our experimental results underscore the effectiveness of AutoGCNin constructing optimal GCN architectures for HAR, outperforming conventionalNAS and GCN methods, as well as random search. These findings highlight thesignificance of a diverse search space and an expressive input representationto enhance the network performance and generalizability.</description><author>Felix Tempel, Inga Strümke, Espen Alexander F.

Thus, we propose Joint tEmporal and cAmeraviewpoiNt alIgnmEnt (JEANIE) for sequence pairs. In particular, we focus on 3Dskeleton sequences whose camera and subjects' poses can be easily manipulatedin 3D. We evaluate JEANIE on skeletal Few-shot Action Recognition (FSAR), wherematching well temporal blocks (temporal chunks that make up a sequence) ofsupport-query sequence pairs (by factoring out nuisance variations) isessential due to limited samples of novel classes. Given a query sequence, wecreate its several views by simulating several camera locations. For a supportsequence, we match it with view-simulated query sequences, as in the popularDynamic Time Warping (DTW). Specifically, each support temporal block can bematched to the query temporal block with the same or adjacent (next) temporalindex, and adjacent camera views to achieve joint local temporal-viewpointwarping. JEANIE selects the smallest distance among matching paths withdifferent temporal-viewpoint warping patterns, an advantage over DTW which onlyperforms temporal alignment. We also propose an unsupervised FSAR akin toclustering of sequences with JEANIE as a distance measure.

Concretely, we seek to explain thedecision-making process of video transformers based on high-level,spatiotemporal concepts that are automatically discovered. Prior research onconcept-based interpretability has concentrated solely on image-level tasks.Comparatively, video models deal with the added temporal dimension, increasingcomplexity and posing challenges in identifying dynamic concepts over time. Inthis work, we systematically address these challenges by introducing the firstVideo Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm. To this end, we proposean efficient approach for unsupervised identification of units of videotransformer representations - concepts, and ranking their importance to theoutput of a model. The resulting concepts are highly interpretable, revealingspatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations inunstructured video models. Performing this analysis jointly over a diverse setof supervised and self-supervised representations, we discover that some ofthese mechanism are universal in video transformers. Finally, we show that VTCDcan be used for fine-grained action recognition and video object segmentation.</description><author>Matthew Kowal, Achal Dave, Rares Ambrus, Adrien Gaidon, Konstantinos G.

However, a persistent and significant challenge within this field isthe accurate prediction of human poses under conditions of severe occlusion.Traditional image-based estimators struggle with heavy occlusions due to a lackof temporal context, resulting in inconsistent predictions. While video-basedmodels benefit from processing temporal data, they encounter limitations whenfaced with prolonged occlusions that extend over multiple frames. Thischallenge arises because these models struggle to generalize beyond theirtraining datasets, and the variety of occlusions is hard to capture in thetraining data. Addressing these challenges, we propose STRIDE (Single-videobased TempoRally contInuous occlusion Robust 3D Pose Estimation), a novelTest-Time Training (TTT) approach to fit a human motion prior for each video.This approach specifically handles occlusions that were not encountered duringthe model's training. By employing STRIDE, we can refine a sequence of noisyinitial pose estimates into accurate, temporally coherent poses during testtime, effectively overcoming the limitations of prior methods. Our frameworkdemonstrates flexibility by being model-agnostic, allowing us to use anyoff-the-shelf 3D pose estimation method for improving robustness and temporalconsistency. We validate STRIDE's efficacy through comprehensive experiments onchallenging datasets like Occluded Human3.6M, Human3.6M, and OCMotion, where itnot only outperforms existing single-image and video-based pose estimationmodels but also showcases superior handling of substantial occlusions,achieving fast, robust, accurate, and temporally consistent 3D pose estimates.</description><author>Rohit Lal, Saketh Bachu, Yash Garg, Arindam Dutta, Calvin-Khang Ta, Dripta S.

Prompt tuning approaches involve injecting a set of learnableprompts along with data tokens during fine-tuning while keeping the backbonefrozen. This approach greatly reduces the number of learnable parameterscompared to full tuning. For image-based downstream tasks, normally a couple oflearnable prompts achieve results close to those of full tuning. However,videos, which contain more complex spatiotemporal information, require hundredsof tunable prompts to achieve reasonably good results. This reduces theparameter efficiency observed in images and significantly increases latency andthe number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) during inference. To tacklethese issues, we directly inject the prompts into the keys and values of thenon-local attention mechanism within the transformer block. Additionally, weintroduce a novel prompt reparameterization technique to make APT more robustagainst hyperparameter selection.

Firstly, there exists a computationaland inference gap in connecting vision and language, making it difficult toaccurately determine which object a given agent acts on and represent itthrough language. Secondly, classifiers trained by a single, monolithic neuralnetwork often lack stability and generalization. To overcome these challenges,we introduce MoE-VRD, a novel approach to visual relationship detectionutilizing a mixture of experts. MoE-VRD identifies language triplets in theform of &lt; subject, predicate, object&gt; tuples to extract relationships fromvisual processing. Leveraging recent advancements in visual relationshipdetection, MoE-VRD addresses the requirement for action recognition inestablishing relationships between subjects (acting) and objects (being actedupon). In contrast to single monolithic networks, MoE-VRD employs multiplesmall models as experts, whose outputs are aggregated. Each expert in MoE-VRDspecializes in visual relationship learning and object tagging. By utilizing asparsely-gated mixture of experts, MoE-VRD enables conditional computation andsignificantly enhances neural network capacity without increasing computationalcomplexity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the conditionalcomputation capabilities and scalability of the mixture-of-experts approachlead to superior performance in visual relationship detection compared tostate-of-the-art methods.</description><author>Ala Shaabana, Zahra Gharaee, Paul Fieguth</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 19:08:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03994v1</guid></item><item><title>Language Model Beats Diffusion -- Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05737v3</link><description>While Large Language Models (LLMs) are the dominant models for generativetasks in language, they do not perform as well as diffusion models on image andvideo generation.

Existing deeppoint cloud sequence modeling approaches imitate the mature 2D video learningmechanisms by developing complex spatio-temporal point neighbor grouping andfeature aggregation schemes, often resulting in methods lacking effectiveness,efficiency, and expressive power. In this paper, we propose a novel genericrepresentation called \textit{Structured Point Cloud Videos} (SPCVs).Intuitively, by leveraging the fact that 3D geometric shapes are essentially 2Dmanifolds, SPCV re-organizes a point cloud sequence as a 2D video with spatialsmoothness and temporal consistency, where the pixel values correspond to the3D coordinates of points. The structured nature of our SPCV representationallows for the seamless adaptation of well-established 2D image/videotechniques, enabling efficient and effective processing and analysis of 3Dpoint cloud sequences. To achieve such re-organization, we design aself-supervised learning pipeline that is geometrically regularized and drivenby self-reconstructive and deformation field learning objectives. Additionally,we construct SPCV-based frameworks for both low-level and high-level 3D pointcloud sequence processing and analysis tasks, including action recognition,temporal interpolation, and compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate theversatility and superiority of the proposed SPCV, which has the potential tooffer new possibilities for deep learning on unstructured 3D point cloudsequences.

Recent approaches address this issue bypre-training according to pseudo-labels, which align object regions with HOItriplets parsed from image captions. However, pseudo-labeling is tricky andnoisy, making HOI pre-training a complex process. Therefore, we propose anefficient disentangled pre-training method for HOI detection (DP-HOI) toaddress this problem. First, DP-HOI utilizes object detection and actionrecognition datasets to pre-train the detection and interaction decoder layers,respectively. Then, we arrange these decoder layers so that the pre-trainingarchitecture is consistent with the downstream HOI detection task. Thisfacilitates efficient knowledge transfer. Specifically, the detection decoderidentifies reliable human instances in each action recognition dataset image,generates one corresponding query, and feeds it into the interaction decoderfor verb classification. Next, we combine the human instance verb predictionsin the same image and impose image-level supervision. The DP-HOI structure canbe easily adapted to the HOI detection task, enabling effective model parameterinitialization. Therefore, it significantly enhances the performance ofexisting HOI detection models on a broad range of rare categories.

The AUs can be used later to classifyfacial expressions in classroom settings. This research paper's findings provide valuable insights into handlingocclusion in analyzing facial images for emotional engagement analysis. Theproposed experiments demonstrate the significance of considering occlusion andenhancing the reliability of facial analysis models in classroom environments.These findings can also be extended to other settings where occlusions areprevalent.</description><author>Shrouk Wally, Ahmed Elsayed, Islam Alkabbany, Asem Ali, Aly Farag</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 03:17:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09465v2</guid></item><item><title>Facial Affective Behavior Analysis with Instruction Tuning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05052v1</link><description>Facial affective behavior analysis (FABA) is crucial for understanding humanmental states from images. However, traditional approaches primarily deploymodels to discriminate among discrete emotion categories, and lack the finegranularity and reasoning capability for complex facial behaviors. The adventof Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has been proven successful ingeneral visual understanding tasks. However, directly harnessing MLLMs for FABAis challenging due to the scarcity of datasets and benchmarks, neglectingfacial prior knowledge, and low training efficiency. To address thesechallenges, we introduce (i) an instruction-following dataset for two FABAtasks, e.g., emotion and action unit recognition, (ii) a benchmark FABA-Benchwith a new metric considering both recognition and generation ability, and(iii) a new MLLM "EmoLA" as a strong baseline to the community. Our initiativeon the dataset and benchmarks reveal the nature and rationale of facialaffective behaviors, i.e., fine-grained facial movement, interpretability, andreasoning. Moreover, to build an effective and efficient FABA MLLM, weintroduce a facial prior expert module with face structure knowledge and alow-rank adaptation module into pre-trained MLLM. We conduct extensiveexperiments on FABA-Bench and four commonly-used FABA datasets. The resultsdemonstrate that the proposed facial prior expert can boost the performance andEmoLA achieves the best results on our FABA-Bench. On commonly-used FABAdatasets, EmoLA is competitive rivaling task-specific state-of-the-art models.</description><author>Yifan Li, Anh Dao, Wentao Bao, Zhen Tan, Tianlong Chen, Huan Liu, Yu Kong</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2024 20:23:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05052v1</guid></item><item><title>A Lie Group Approach to Riemannian Batch Normalization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11261v1</link><description>Manifold-valued measurements exist in numerous applications within computervision and machine learning. Recent studies have extended Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) to manifolds, and concomitantly, normalization techniques have also beenadapted to several manifolds, referred to as Riemannian normalization.Nonetheless, most of the existing Riemannian normalization methods have beenderived in an ad hoc manner and only apply to specific manifolds. This paperestablishes a unified framework for Riemannian Batch Normalization (RBN)techniques on Lie groups. Our framework offers the theoretical guarantee ofcontrolling both the Riemannian mean and variance. Empirically, we focus onSymmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifolds, which possess three distinct typesof Lie group structures. Using the deformation concept, we generalize theexisting Lie groups on SPD manifolds into three families of parameterized Liegroups. Specific normalization layers induced by these Lie groups are thenproposed for SPD neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ourapproach through three sets of experiments: radar recognition, human actionrecognition, and electroencephalography (EEG) classification.

We introduce a unified framework forbuilding Riemannian classifiers under the metrics pulled back from theEuclidean space, and showcase our framework under the parameterizedLog-Euclidean Metric (LEM) and Log-Cholesky Metric (LCM).

This study aims toinvestigate the correlation between two continuous sensor streams, pupildiameter as an indicator of cognitive workload and FACTs with deep learning asan indicator of emotional arousal (RQ 1a), specifically for epochs of high,medium, and low arousal (RQ 1b). Furthermore, the time lag between emotionalarousal and pupil diameter data will be analyzed (RQ 2). 28 participants workedon three cognitively demanding and emotionally engaging everyday moral dilemmaswhile eye-tracking and emotion recognition data were collected. The data werepre-processed in Phyton (synchronization, blink control, downsampling) andanalyzed using correlation analysis and Granger causality tests. The resultsshow negative and statistically significant correlations between the datastreams for emotional arousal and pupil diameter. However, the correlation isnegative and significant only for epochs of high arousal, while positive butnon-significant relationships were found for epochs of medium or low arousal.The average time lag for the relationship between arousal and pupil diameterwas 2.8 ms. In contrast to previous findings without a multimodal approachsuggesting a positive correlation between the constructs, the resultscontribute to the state of research by highlighting the importance ofmultimodal data validation and research on convergent vagility.

Dominant pipelinespropose to tackle the visual discrepancies with additional temporal learnerswhile overlooking the substantial discrepancy for web-scaled descriptivenarratives and concise action category names, leading to less distinct semanticspace and potential performance limitations. In this work, we prioritize therefinement of text knowledge to facilitate generalizable video recognition. Toaddress the limitations of the less distinct semantic space of category names,we prompt a large language model (LLM) to augment action class names intoSpatio-Temporal Descriptors thus bridging the textual discrepancy and servingas a knowledge base for general recognition. Moreover, to assign the bestdescriptors with different video instances, we propose Optimal DescriptorSolver, forming the video recognition problem as solving the optimal matchingflow across frame-level representations and descriptors.

In this study, we revealed from exploratory data analysis thatsurgical videos enjoy relatively simple semantic structure, where the presenceof surgical phases and tools can be well modeled by a compact hidden Markovmodel (HMM). Based on this observation, we propose an HMM-stabilized deeplearning method for tool presence detection. A wide range of experimentsconfirm that the proposed approaches achieve better performance with lowertraining and running costs, and support more flexible ways to construct andutilize training data in scenarios where not all surgery videos of interest areextensively labelled.

However,the prevailing defenses depend on single observation or pre-establishedadversary information to counter adversarial patches, often failing to beconfronted with unseen or adaptive adversarial attacks and easily exhibitingunsatisfying performance in dynamic 3D environments. Inspired by active humanperception and recurrent feedback mechanisms, we develop Embodied ActiveDefense (EAD), a proactive defensive strategy that actively contextualizesenvironmental information to address misaligned adversarial patches in 3Dreal-world settings. To achieve this, EAD develops two central recurrentsub-modules, i.e., a perception module and a policy module, to implement twocritical functions of active vision. These models recurrently process a seriesof beliefs and observations, facilitating progressive refinement of theircomprehension of the target object and enabling the development of strategicactions to counter adversarial patches in 3D environments. To optimize learningefficiency, we incorporate a differentiable approximation of environmentaldynamics and deploy patches that are agnostic to the adversary strategies.Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAD substantially enhances robustnessagainst a variety of patches within just a few steps through its action policyin safety-critical tasks (e.g., face recognition and object detection), withoutcompromising standard accuracy. Furthermore, due to the attack-agnosticcharacteristic, EAD facilitates excellent generalization to unseen attacks,diminishing the averaged attack success rate by 95 percent across a range ofunseen adversarial attacks.</description><author>Lingxuan Wu, Xiao Yang, Yinpeng Dong, Liuwei Xie, Hang Su, Jun Zhu</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 04:02:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00540v1</guid></item><item><title>Ain't Misbehavin' -- Using LLMs to Generate Expressive Robot Behavior in Conversations with the Tabletop Robot Haru</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11571v1</link><description>Social robots aim to establish long-term bonds with humans through engagingconversation.

To dothis, video-language models must be able to obtain structured understandings,such as the temporal segmentation of a demonstration into sequences of actionsand skills, and to generalize the understandings to novel domains. In pursuitof this goal, we introduce Spacewalk-18, a benchmark containing two tasks: (1)step recognition and (2) intra-video retrieval over a dataset of temporallysegmented and labeled tasks in International Space Station spacewalkrecordings. In tandem, the two tasks quantify a model's ability to make use of:(1) out-of-domain visual information; (2) a high temporal context window; and(3) multimodal (e.g. visual and speech) domains. This departs from existingbenchmarks for procedural video understanding, which typically deal with shortcontext lengths and can be solved with a single modality. Spacewalk-18, withits inherent multimodal and long-form complexity, exposes the high difficultyof task recognition and segmentation. We find that state-of-the-art methodsperform poorly on our benchmark, but improvements can be obtained byincorporating information from longer-range temporal context across differentmodalities.

Despite itsimportance, the principles that govern prosodic structure are not yetadequately understood. This paper offers an analytical schema and atechnological proof-of-concept for the categorization of prosodic signals andtheir association with meaning. The schema interprets surface-representationsof multi-layered prosodic events. As a first step towards implementation, wepresent a classification process that disentangles prosodic phenomena of threeorders. It relies on fine-tuning a pre-trained speech recognition model,enabling the simultaneous multi-class/multi-label detection.

A practical and user-friendly dialogue system should beclient-centric, focusing on the client's behaviors. However, existing dialoguesystems publicly available for mental health support often concentrate solelyon the counselor's strategies rather than the behaviors expressed by clients.This can lead to unreasonable or inappropriate counseling strategies andcorresponding responses generated by the dialogue system. To address thisissue, we propose PsyChat, a client-centric dialogue system that providespsychological support through online chat. The client-centric dialogue systemcomprises five modules: client behavior recognition, counselor strategyselection, input packer, response generator, and response selection. Bothautomatic and human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and practicalityof our proposed dialogue system for real-life mental health support.Furthermore, the case study demonstrates that the dialogue system can predictthe client's behaviors, select appropriate counselor strategies, and generateaccurate and suitable responses.</description><author>Huachuan Qiu, Anqi Li, Lizhi Ma, Zhenzhong Lan</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 02:59:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04262v2</guid></item><item><title>Beyond the Labels: Unveiling Text-Dependency in Paralinguistic Speech Recognition Datasets</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07767v1</link><description>Paralinguistic traits like cognitive load and emotion are increasinglyrecognized as pivotal areas in speech recognition research, often examinedthrough specialized datasets like CLSE and IEMOCAP. However, the integrity ofthese datasets is seldom scrutinized for text-dependency. This paper criticallyevaluates the prevalent assumption that machine learning models trained on suchdatasets genuinely learn to identify paralinguistic traits, rather than merelycapturing lexical features. By examining the lexical overlap in these datasetsand testing the performance of machine learning models, we expose significanttext-dependency in trait-labeling. Our results suggest that some machinelearning models, especially large pre-trained models like HuBERT, mightinadvertently focus on lexical characteristics rather than the intendedparalinguistic features. The study serves as a call to action for the researchcommunity to reevaluate the reliability of existing datasets and methodologies,ensuring that machine learning models genuinely learn what they are designed torecognize.</description><author>Jan Pešán, Santosh Kesiraju, Lukáš Burget, Jan ''Honza'' Černocký</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 16:54:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07767v1</guid></item><item><title>Systemic Biases in Sign Language AI Research: A Deaf-Led Call to Reevaluate Research Agendas</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02563v1</link><description>Growing research in sign language recognition, generation, and translation AIhas been accompanied by calls for ethical development of such technologies.While these works are crucial to helping individual researchers do better,there is a notable lack of discussion of systemic biases or analysis ofrhetoric that shape the research questions and methods in the field, especiallyas it remains dominated by hearing non-signing researchers. Therefore, weconduct a systematic review of 101 recent papers in sign language AI. Ouranalysis identifies significant biases in the current state of sign language AIresearch, including an overfocus on addressing perceived communicationbarriers, a lack of use of representative datasets, use of annotations lackinglinguistic foundations, and development of methods that build on flawed models.We take the position that the field lacks meaningful input from Deafstakeholders, and is instead driven by what decisions are the most convenientor perceived as important to hearing researchers. We end with a call to action:the field must make space for Deaf researchers to lead the conversation in signlanguage AI.</description><author>Aashaka Desai, Maartje De Meulder, Julie A.

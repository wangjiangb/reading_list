Existing literature focuses on 3D hand pose input, whichrequires computationally intensive depth estimation networks or wearing anuncomfortable depth sensor. In contrast, there has been insufficient researchin understanding 2D hand pose for egocentric action recognition, despite theavailability of user-friendly smart glasses in the market capable of capturinga single RGB image. Our study aims to fill this research gap by exploring thefield of 2D hand pose estimation for egocentric action recognition, making twocontributions. Firstly, we introduce two novel approaches for 2D hand poseestimation, namely EffHandNet for single-hand estimation and EffHandEgoNet,tailored for an egocentric perspective, capturing interactions between handsand objects. Both methods outperform state-of-the-art models on H2O and FPHApublic benchmarks. Secondly, we present a robust action recognitionarchitecture from 2D hand and object poses. This method incorporatesEffHandEgoNet, and a transformer-based action recognition method. Evaluated onH2O and FPHA datasets, our architecture has a faster inference time andachieves an accuracy of 91.32% and 94.43%, respectively, surpassing state ofthe art, including 3D-based methods. Our work demonstrates that using 2Dskeletal data is a robust approach for egocentric action understanding.Extensive evaluation and ablation studies show the impact of the hand poseestimation approach, and how each input affects the overall performance.</description><author>Wiktor Mucha, Martin Kampel</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2024 18:33:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09308v1</guid></item><item><title>Hypergraph-based Multi-View Action Recognition using Event Cameras</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19316v1</link><description>Action recognition from video data forms a cornerstone with wide-rangingapplications. Single-view action recognition faces limitations due to itsreliance on a single viewpoint. In contrast, multi-view approaches capturecomplementary information from various viewpoints for improved accuracy.Recently, event cameras have emerged as innovative bio-inspired sensors,leading to advancements in event-based action recognition. However, existingworks predominantly focus on single-view scenarios, leaving a gap in multi-viewevent data exploitation, particularly in challenges like information deficitand semantic misalignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce HyperMV, amulti-view event-based action recognition framework. HyperMV converts discreteevent data into frame-like representations and extracts view-related featuresusing a shared convolutional network. By treating segments as vertices andconstructing hyperedges using rule-based and KNN-based strategies, a multi-viewhypergraph neural network that captures relationships across viewpoint andtemporal features is established. The vertex attention hypergraph propagationis also introduced for enhanced feature fusion. To prompt research in thisarea, we present the largest multi-view event-based action dataset$\text{THU}^{\text{MV-EACT}}\text{-50}$, comprising 50 actions from 6viewpoints, which surpasses existing datasets by over tenfold. Experimentalresults show that HyperMV significantly outperforms baselines in bothcross-subject and cross-view scenarios, and also exceeds the state-of-the-artsin frame-based multi-view action recognition.</description><author>Yue Gao, Jiaxuan Lu, Siqi Li, Yipeng Li, Shaoyi Du</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2024 12:17:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19316v1</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Explainability in Video Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09067v1</link><description>Image Classification and Video Action Recognition are perhaps the two mostfoundational tasks in computer vision. Consequently, explaining the innerworkings of trained deep neural networks is of prime importance. While numerousefforts focus on explaining the decisions of trained deep neural networks inimage classification, exploration in the domain of its temporal version, videoaction recognition, has been scant. In this work, we take a deeper look at thisproblem. We begin by revisiting Grad-CAM, one of the popular featureattribution methods for Image Classification, and its extension to Video ActionRecognition tasks and examine the method's limitations. To address these, weintroduce Video-TCAV, by building on TCAV for Image Classification tasks, whichaims to quantify the importance of specific concepts in the decision-makingprocess of Video Action Recognition models. As the scalable generation ofconcepts is still an open problem, we propose a machine-assisted approach togenerate spatial and spatiotemporal concepts relevant to Video ActionRecognition for testing Video-TCAV. We then establish the importance oftemporally-varying concepts by demonstrating the superiority of dynamicspatiotemporal concepts over trivial spatial concepts. In conclusion, weintroduce a framework for investigating hypotheses in action recognition andquantitatively testing them, thus advancing research in the explainability ofdeep neural networks used in video action recognition.</description><author>Avinab Saha, Shashank Gupta, Sravan Kumar Ankireddy, Karl Chahine, Joydeep Ghosh</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 20:34:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09067v1</guid></item><item><title>SkateFormer: Skeletal-Temporal Transformer for Human Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09508v1</link><description>Skeleton-based action recognition, which classifies human actions based onthe coordinates of joints and their connectivity within skeleton data, iswidely utilized in various scenarios. While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)have been proposed for skeleton data represented as graphs, they suffer fromlimited receptive fields constrained by joint connectivity. To address thislimitation, recent advancements have introduced transformer-based methods.However, capturing correlations between all joints in all frames requiressubstantial memory resources. To alleviate this, we propose a novel approachcalled Skeletal-Temporal Transformer (SkateFormer) that partitions joints andframes based on different types of skeletal-temporal relation (Skate-Type) andperforms skeletal-temporal self-attention (Skate-MSA) within each partition. Wecategorize the key skeletal-temporal relations for action recognition into atotal of four distinct types. These types combine (i) two skeletal relationtypes based on physically neighboring and distant joints, and (ii) two temporalrelation types based on neighboring and distant frames. Through thispartition-specific attention strategy, our SkateFormer can selectively focus onkey joints and frames crucial for action recognition in an action-adaptivemanner with efficient computation. Extensive experiments on various benchmarkdatasets validate that our SkateFormer outperforms recent state-of-the-artmethods.</description><author>Jeonghyeok Do, Munchurl Kim</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 16:55:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09508v1</guid></item><item><title>ActNetFormer: Transformer-ResNet Hybrid Method for Semi-Supervised Action Recognition in Videos</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06243v1</link><description>Human action or activity recognition in videos is a fundamental task incomputer vision with applications in surveillance and monitoring, self-drivingcars, sports analytics, human-robot interaction and many more. Traditionalsupervised methods require large annotated datasets for training, which areexpensive and time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes a novel approachusing Cross-Architecture Pseudo-Labeling with contrastive learning forsemi-supervised action recognition. Our framework leverages both labeled andunlabelled data to robustly learn action representations in videos, combiningpseudo-labeling with contrastive learning for effective learning from bothtypes of samples. We introduce a novel cross-architecture approach where 3DConvolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) and video transformers (VIT) areutilised to capture different aspects of action representations; hence we callit ActNetFormer. The 3D CNNs excel at capturing spatial features and localdependencies in the temporal domain, while VIT excels at capturing long-rangedependencies across frames. By integrating these complementary architectureswithin the ActNetFormer framework, our approach can effectively capture bothlocal and global contextual information of an action. This comprehensiverepresentation learning enables the model to achieve better performance insemi-supervised action recognition tasks by leveraging the strengths of each ofthese architectures. Experimental results on standard action recognitiondatasets demonstrate that our approach performs better than the existingmethods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only a fraction of labeleddata.

While plain Transformershave been attempted for this task, they still fall short compared to thecurrent leading methods, which are rooted in Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) due to the absence of structural priors. Recently, a novel selectivestate space model, Mamba, has surfaced as a compelling alternative to theattention mechanism in Transformers, offering efficient modeling of longsequences. In this work, to the utmost extent of our awareness, we present thefirst SAR framework incorporating Mamba. Each fundamental block of our modeladopts a novel U-ShiftGCN architecture with Mamba as its core component. Theencoder segment of the U-ShiftGCN is devised to extract spatial features fromthe skeletal data using downsampling vanilla Shift S-GCN blocks. These spatialfeatures then undergo intermediate temporal modeling facilitated by the Mambablock before progressing to the encoder section, which comprises vanillaupsampling Shift S-GCN blocks. Additionally, a Shift T-GCN (ShiftTCN) temporalmodeling unit is employed before the exit of each fundamental block to refinetemporal representations. This particular integration of downsampling spatial,intermediate temporal, upsampling spatial, and ultimate temporal subunitsyields promising results for skeleton action recognition. We dub the resultingmodel \textbf{Simba}, which attains state-of-the-art performance across threewell-known benchmark skeleton action recognition datasets: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D120, and Northwestern-UCLA. Interestingly, U-ShiftGCN (Simba withoutIntermediate Mamba Block) by itself is capable of performing reasonably welland surpasses our baseline.</description><author>Soumyabrata Chaudhuri, Saumik Bhattacharya</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 12:07:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07645v1</guid></item><item><title>SkelVIT: Consensus of Vision Transformers for a Lightweight Skeleton-Based Action Recognition System</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08094v2</link><description>Skeleton-based action recognition receives the attention of many researchersas it is robust to viewpoint and illumination changes, and its processing ismuch more efficient than the processing of video frames. With the emergence ofdeep learning models, it has become very popular to represent the skeleton datain pseudo-image form and apply CNN for action recognition. Thereafter, studiesconcentrated on finding effective methods for forming pseudo-images. Recently,attention networks, more specifically transformers have provided promisingresults in various vision problems. In this study, the effectiveness of VIT forskeleton-based action recognition is examined and its robustness on thepseudo-image representation scheme is investigated. To this end, a three-levelarchitecture, SkelVit is proposed, which forms a set of pseudo images, appliesa classifier on each of the representations, and combines their results to findthe final action class. The performance of SkelVit is examined thoroughly via aset of experiments. First, the sensitivity of the system to representation isinvestigated by comparing it with two of the state-of-the-art pseudo-imagerepresentation methods. Then, the classifiers of SkelVit are realized in twoexperimental setups by CNNs and VITs, and their performances are compared. Inthe final experimental setup, the contribution of combining classifiers isexamined by applying the model with a different number of classifiers.Experimental studies reveal that the proposed system with its lightweightrepresentation scheme achieves better results than the state-of-the-artmethods. It is also observed that the vision transformer is less sensitive tothe initial pseudo-image representation compared to CNN. Nevertheless, evenwith the vision transformer, the recognition performance can be furtherimproved by the consensus of classifiers.</description><author>Ozge Oztimur Karadag</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 07:20:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08094v2</guid></item><item><title>Emotion Recognition from the perspective of Activity Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16263v1</link><description>Applications of an efficient emotion recognition system can be found inseveral domains such as medicine, driver fatigue surveillance, social robotics,and human-computer interaction. Appraising human emotional states, behaviors,and reactions displayed in real-world settings can be accomplished using latentcontinuous dimensions. Continuous dimensional models of human affect, such asthose based on valence and arousal are more accurate in describing a broadrange of spontaneous everyday emotions than more traditional models of discretestereotypical emotion categories (e.g. happiness, surprise). Most of the priorwork on estimating valence and arousal considers laboratory settings and acteddata. But, for emotion recognition systems to be deployed and integrated intoreal-world mobile and computing devices, we need to consider data collected inthe world. Action recognition is a domain of Computer Vision that involvescapturing complementary information on appearance from still frames and motionbetween frames. In this paper, we treat emotion recognition from theperspective of action recognition by exploring the application of deep learningarchitectures specifically designed for action recognition, for continuousaffect recognition. We propose a novel three-stream end-to-end deep learningregression pipeline with an attention mechanism, which is an ensemble designbased on sub-modules of multiple state-of-the-art action recognition systems.The pipeline constitutes a novel data pre-processing approach with a spatialself-attention mechanism to extract keyframes. The optical flow ofhigh-attention regions of the face is extracted to capture temporal context.AFEW-VA in-the-wild dataset has been used to conduct comparative experiments.Quantitative analysis shows that the proposed model outperforms multiplestandard baselines of both emotion recognition and action recognition models.</description><author>Savinay Nagendra, Prapti Panigrahi</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2024 19:53:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16263v1</guid></item><item><title>D$^2$ST-Adapter: Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter for Few-shot Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01431v2</link><description>Adapting large pre-trained image models to few-shot action recognition hasproven to be an effective and efficient strategy for learning robust featureextractors, which is essential for few-shot learning. Typical fine-tuning basedadaptation paradigm is prone to overfitting in the few-shot learning scenariosand offers little modeling flexibility for learning temporal features in videodata. In this work we present the Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-TemporalAdapter (D$^2$ST-Adapter), which is a novel adapter tuning frameworkwell-suited for few-shot action recognition due to lightweight design and lowparameter-learning overhead. It is designed in a dual-pathway architecture toencode spatial and temporal features in a disentangled manner. In particular,we devise the anisotropic Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention module as thecore component of D$^2$ST-Adapter, which can be tailored with anisotropicsampling densities along spatial and temporal domains to learn spatial andtemporal features specifically in corresponding pathways, allowing ourD$^2$ST-Adapter to encode features in a global view in 3D spatio-temporal spacewhile maintaining a lightweight design. Extensive experiments withinstantiations of our method on both pre-trained ResNet and ViT demonstrate thesuperiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods for few-shot actionrecognition.

Nonetheless,current methodologies often lean towards utilizing a solitary backbone to modelskeleton modality, which can be limited by inherent flaws in the networkbackbone. To address this and fully leverage the complementary characteristicsof various network architectures, we propose a novel Hybrid Dual-Branch Network(HDBN) for robust skeleton-based action recognition, which benefits from thegraph convolutional network's proficiency in handling graph-structured data andthe powerful modeling capabilities of Transformers for global information. Indetail, our proposed HDBN is divided into two trunk branches: MixGCN andMixFormer. The two branches utilize GCNs and Transformers to model both 2D and3D skeletal modalities respectively. Our proposed HDBN emerged as one of thetop solutions in the Multi-Modal Video Reasoning and Analyzing Competition(MMVRAC) of 2024 ICME Grand Challenge, achieving accuracies of 47.95% and75.36% on two benchmarks of the UAV-Human dataset by outperforming mostexisting methods.

Key challenges include how to identify and leverage the transferableknowledge learned by the pre-trained model. Our central hypothesis is thattemporal invariance in the dynamic system between latent variables lends itselfto transferability (domain-invariance). We therefore propose DITeD, orDomain-Invariant Temporal Dynamics for knowledge transfer. To detect thetemporal invariance part, we propose a generative framework with a two-stagetraining strategy during pre-training. Specifically, we explicitly modelinvariant dynamics including temporal dynamic generation and transitions, andthe variant visual and domain encoders. Then we pre-train the model with theself-supervised signals to learn the representation. After that, we fix thewhole representation model and tune the classifier. During adaptation, we fixthe transferable temporal dynamics and update the image encoder. The efficacyof our approach is revealed by the superior accuracy of DITeD over leadingalternatives across standard few-shot action recognition datasets. Moreover, wevalidate that the learned temporal dynamic transition and temporal dynamicgeneration modules possess transferable qualities.</description><author>Yuke Li, Guangyi Chen, Ben Abramowitz, Stefano Anzellott, Donglai Wei</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 04:09:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12706v1</guid></item><item><title>Fine-Grained Side Information Guided Dual-Prompts for Zero-Shot Skeleton Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07487v2</link><description>Skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition aims to recognize unknown humanactions based on the learned priors of the known skeleton-based actions and asemantic descriptor space shared by both known and unknown categories.

It offers insights into the feelings and intentions ofindividuals and is important for human-oriented applications such as emotionrecognition and psychological assessment. However, the identification,differentiation, and understanding of micro-actions pose challenges due to theimperceptible and inaccessible nature of these subtle human behaviors ineveryday life. In this study, we innovatively collect a new micro-actiondataset designated as Micro-action-52 (MA-52), and propose a benchmark namedmicro-action network (MANet) for micro-action recognition (MAR) task. Uniquely,MA-52 provides the whole-body perspective including gestures, upper- andlower-limb movements, attempting to reveal comprehensive micro-action cues. Indetail, MA-52 contains 52 micro-action categories along with seven body partlabels, and encompasses a full array of realistic and natural micro-actions,accounting for 205 participants and 22,422 video instances collated from thepsychological interviews. Based on the proposed dataset, we assess MANet andother nine prevalent action recognition methods. MANet incorporates squeeze-andexcitation (SE) and temporal shift module (TSM) into the ResNet architecturefor modeling the spatiotemporal characteristics of micro-actions. Then ajoint-embedding loss is designed for semantic matching between video and actionlabels; the loss is used to better distinguish between visually similar yetdistinct micro-action categories. The extended application in emotionrecognition has demonstrated one of the important values of our proposeddataset and method. In the future, further exploration of human behaviour,emotion, and psychological assessment will be conducted in depth.

To efficiently model hand-object interactions, we proposeHandFormer, a novel multimodal transformer. HandFormer combines 3D hand posesat a high temporal resolution for fine-grained motion modeling with sparselysampled RGB frames for encoding scene semantics. Observing the uniquecharacteristics of hand poses, we temporally factorize hand modeling andrepresent each joint by its short-term trajectories. This factorized poserepresentation combined with sparse RGB samples is remarkably efficient andachieves high accuracy.

Albeit recent advancements, existing powerful methods are still prone tomaking ambiguous predictions under scarce labeled data, embodied as thelimitation of distinguishing different actions with similar spatio-temporalinformation. In this paper, we approach this problem by empowering the modeltwo aspects of capability, namely discriminative spatial modeling and temporalstructure modeling for learning discriminative spatio-temporal representations.Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Contrastive Learning~(ACL) strategy. Itassesses the confidence of all unlabeled samples by the class prototypes of thelabeled data, and adaptively selects positive-negative samples from apseudo-labeled sample bank to construct contrastive learning. Additionally, weintroduce a Multi-scale Temporal Learning~(MTL) strategy. It could highlightinformative semantics from long-term clips and integrate them into theshort-term clip while suppressing noisy information. Afterwards, both of thesetwo new techniques are integrated in a unified framework to encourage the modelto make accurate predictions.

The recent state-of-the-art models for SARare primarily based on graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs), which arepowerful in extracting the spatial information of skeleton data. However, it isyet clear that such GCN-based models can effectively capture the temporaldynamics of human action sequences. To this end, we propose the DevLSTM module,which exploits the path development -- a principled and parsimoniousrepresentation for sequential data by leveraging the Lie group structure. Thepath development, originated from Rough path theory, can effectively capturethe order of events in high-dimensional stream data with massive dimensionreduction and consequently enhance the LSTM module substantially. Our proposedG-DevLSTM module can be conveniently plugged into the temporal graph,complementing existing advanced GCN-based models. Our empirical studies on theNTU60, NTU120 and Chalearn2013 datasets demonstrate that our proposed hybridmodel significantly outperforms the current best-performing methods in SARtasks.

However,due to their deep structure and reliance on continuous floating-pointoperations, GCN-based methods are energy-intensive. To address this issue, wepropose an innovative Spiking Graph Convolutional Network with MultimodalFusion and Knowledge Distillation (MK-SGN). By merging the energy efficiency ofSpiking Neural Network (SNN) with the graph representation capability of GCN,the proposed MK-SGN reduces energy consumption while maintaining recognitionaccuracy. Firstly, we convert GCN into Spiking Graph Convolutional Network(SGN) and construct a foundational Base-SGN for skeleton-based actionrecognition, establishing a new benchmark and paving the way for futureresearch exploration. Secondly, we further propose a Spiking Multimodal Fusionmodule (SMF), leveraging mutual information to process multimodal data moreefficiently.

On two challenging datasets for skeleton-based actionrecognition, MK-SGN outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN-like frameworks inreducing computational load and energy consumption.

However, current research is hinderedby 1) the difficulty in processing events because of their prolonged durationand dynamic actions with complex and ambiguous semantics and 2) the redundantaction depiction of the event frame representation with fixed stacks. We findlanguage naturally conveys abundant semantic information, rendering itstunningly superior in reducing semantic uncertainty. In light of this, wepropose ExACT, a novel approach that, for the first time, tackles event-basedaction recognition from a cross-modal conceptualizing perspective. Our ExACTbrings two technical contributions. Firstly, we propose an adaptivefine-grained event (AFE) representation to adaptively filter out the repeatedevents for the stationary objects while preserving dynamic ones. This subtlyenhances the performance of ExACT without extra computational cost. Then, wepropose a conceptual reasoning-based uncertainty estimation module, whichsimulates the recognition process to enrich the semantic representation. Inparticular, conceptual reasoning builds the temporal relation based on theaction semantics, and uncertainty estimation tackles the semantic uncertaintyof actions based on the distributional representation. Experiments show thatour ExACT achieves superior recognition accuracy of 94.83%(+2.23%),90.10%(+37.47%) and 67.24% on PAF, HARDVS and our SeAct datasets respectively.</description><author>Jiazhou Zhou, Xu Zheng, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Lin Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 09:15:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12534v1</guid></item><item><title>Fine-grained Action Analysis: A Multi-modality and Multi-task Dataset of Figure Skating</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02730v3</link><description>The fine-grained action analysis of the existing action datasets ischallenged by insufficient action categories, low fine granularities, limitedmodalities, and tasks.

To alleviate these, we proposeto leverage text description generated from large language models (LLM) thatcontain high-level human knowledge, to guide feature learning, in aglobal-local-global way. Particularly, during training, we design $2$ promptsto gain global and local text descriptions of each action from an LLM. We firstutilize the global text description to guide the skeleton encoder focus oninformative joints (i.e.,global-to-local). Then we build non-local interactionbetween local text and joint features, to form the final global representation(i.e., local-to-global). To mitigate the asymmetry issue between the trainingand inference phases, we further design a dual-branch architecture that allowsthe model to perform novel class inference without any text input, also makingthe additional inference cost neglectable compared with the base skeletonencoder. Extensive experiments on three different benchmarks show that CrossGLGconsistently outperforms the existing SOTA methods with large margins, and theinference cost (model size) is only $2.8$\% than the previous SOTA. CrossGLGcan also serve as a plug-and-play module that can substantially enhance theperformance of different SOTA skeleton encoders with a neglectable cost duringinference.

However, most existing methods follow an "adaptthen align" paradigm, which adapts pre-trained image encoders to modelvideo-level representations and utilizes one-hot or text embedding of theaction labels for supervision. This paradigm overlooks the challenge of mappingfrom static images to complicated activity concepts. In this paper, we proposea novel "Align before Adapt" (ALT) paradigm. Prior to adapting to videorepresentation learning, we exploit the entity-to-region alignments for eachframe. The alignments are fulfilled by matching the region-aware imageembeddings to an offline-constructed text corpus. With the aligned entities, wefeed their text embeddings to a transformer-based video adapter as the queries,which can help extract the semantics of the most important entities from avideo to a vector. This paradigm reuses the visual-language alignment of VLPduring adaptation and tries to explain an action by the underlying entities.This helps understand actions by bridging the gap with complex activitysemantics, particularly when facing unfamiliar or unseen categories. ALTdemonstrates competitive performance while maintaining remarkably lowcomputational costs. In fully supervised experiments, it achieves 88.1% top-1accuracy on Kinetics-400 with only 4947 GFLOPs.

LfO canfacilitate robot integration on factory floors by minimizing disruption andreducing tedious programming. A key component of the LfO pipeline is atransformation of the depth camera frames to the corresponding task state andaction pairs, which are then relayed to learning techniques such as imitationor inverse reinforcement learning for understanding the task parameters. Whileseveral existing computer vision models analyze videos for activityrecognition, SA-Net specifically targets robotic LfO from RGB-D data. However,SA-Net and many other models analyze frame data captured from a singleviewpoint. Their analysis is therefore highly sensitive to occlusions of theobserved task, which are frequent in deployments. An obvious way of reducingocclusions is to simultaneously observe the task from multiple viewpoints andsynchronously fuse the multiple streams in the model. Toward this, we presentmulti-view SA-Net, which generalizes the SA-Net model to allow the perceptionof multiple viewpoints of the task activity, integrate them, and betterrecognize the state and action in each frame. Performance evaluations on twodistinct domains establish that MVSA-Net recognizes the state-action pairsunder occlusion more accurately compared to single-view MVSA-Net and otherbaselines.

To enable generalization ofarbitrary classes, existing methods treat class labels as text descriptions,then formulate OVAR as evaluating embedding similarity between visual samplesand textual classes. However, one crucial issue is completely ignored: theclass descriptions given by users may be noisy, e.g., misspellings and typos,limiting the real-world practicality of vanilla OVAR. To fill the research gap,this paper pioneers to evaluate existing methods by simulating multi-levelnoises of various types, and reveals their poor robustness. To tackle the noisyOVAR task, we further propose one novel DENOISER framework, covering two parts:generation and discrimination. Concretely, the generative part denoises noisyclass-text names via one decoding process, i.e., propose text candidates, thenutilize inter-modal and intra-modal information to vote for the best. At thediscriminative part, we use vanilla OVAR models to assign visual samples toclass-text names, thus obtaining more semantics. For optimization, wealternately iterate between generative and discriminative parts for progressiverefinements. The denoised text classes help OVAR models classify visual samplesmore accurately; in return, classified visual samples help better denoising.

While none ofexisting approach thoroughly model such hierarchical inter-dependencies amongAUs, this paper proposes to comprehensively model multi-scale AU-relateddynamic and hierarchical spatio-temporal relationship among AUs for theiroccurrences recognition. Specifically, we first propose a novel multi-scaletemporal differencing network with an adaptive weighting block to explicitlycapture facial dynamics across frames at different spatial scales, whichspecifically considers the heterogeneity of range and magnitude in differentAUs' activation. Then, a two-stage strategy is introduced to hierarchicallymodel the relationship among AUs based on their spatial distribution (i.e.,local and cross-region AU relationship modelling).

Recent approaches used inherently interpretable models to analyzevideo actions in a manner akin to human reasoning. These models, however,usually fall short in performance compared to their black-box counterparts. Inthis work, we present a new framework named Language-guided InterpretableAction Recognition framework (LaIAR). LaIAR leverages knowledge from languagemodels to enhance both the recognition capabilities and the interpretability ofvideo models. In essence, we redefine the problem of understanding video modeldecisions as a task of aligning video and language models. Using the logicalreasoning captured by the language model, we steer the training of the videomodel. This integrated approach not only improves the video model'sadaptability to different domains but also boosts its overall performance.Extensive experiments on two complex video action datasets, Charades &amp; CAD-120,validates the improved performance and interpretability of our LaIAR framework.The code of LaIAR is available at https://github.com/NingWang2049/LaIAR.</description><author>Ning Wang, Guangming Zhu, HS Li, Liang Zhang, Syed Afaq Ali Shah, Mohammed Bennamoun</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 03:31:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01591v1</guid></item><item><title>LLMs are Good Action Recognizers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00532v1</link><description>Skeleton-based action recognition has attracted lots of research attention.Recently, to build an accurate skeleton-based action recognizer, a variety ofworks have been proposed.

However, prevailing methods for 4Dpoint cloud recognition have limitations due to sensor resolution, which leadsto a lack of detailed information. Recent advances have shown thatVision-Language Models (VLM) pre-trained on web-scale text-image datasets canlearn fine-grained visual concepts that can be transferred to variousdownstream tasks. However, effectively integrating VLM into the domain of 4Dpoint clouds remains an unresolved problem. In this work, we propose theVision-Language Models Goes 4D (VG4D) framework to transfer VLM knowledge fromvisual-text pre-trained models to a 4D point cloud network. Our approachinvolves aligning the 4D encoder's representation with a VLM to learn a sharedvisual and text space from training on large-scale image-text pairs. Bytransferring the knowledge of the VLM to the 4D encoder and combining the VLM,our VG4D achieves improved recognition performance. To enhance the 4D encoder,we modernize the classic dynamic point cloud backbone and propose an improvedversion of PSTNet, im-PSTNet, which can efficiently model point cloud videos.Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performancefor action recognition on both the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset and the NTU RGB+D 120dataset.

HAR has gained attention due to advances in deep learning, increaseddata availability, and enhanced computational capabilities. At the same time,GCNs have shown promising results in modeling relationships between body keypoints in a skeletal graph. While domain experts often craft dataset-specificGCN-based methods, their applicability beyond this specific context is severelylimited. AutoGCN seeks to address this limitation by simultaneously searchingfor the ideal hyperparameters and architecture combination within a versatilesearch space using a reinforcement controller while balancing optimalexploration and exploitation behavior with a knowledge reservoir during thesearch process. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale datasetsfocused on skeleton-based action recognition to assess the proposed algorithm'sperformance. Our experimental results underscore the effectiveness of AutoGCNin constructing optimal GCN architectures for HAR, outperforming conventionalNAS and GCN methods, as well as random search.

Given a query sequence, wecreate its several views by simulating several camera locations. For a supportsequence, we match it with view-simulated query sequences, as in the popularDynamic Time Warping (DTW). Specifically, each support temporal block can bematched to the query temporal block with the same or adjacent (next) temporalindex, and adjacent camera views to achieve joint local temporal-viewpointwarping. JEANIE selects the smallest distance among matching paths withdifferent temporal-viewpoint warping patterns, an advantage over DTW which onlyperforms temporal alignment.

Our self-training process successfully leverages thestrengths of both models to achieve strong transfer performance across domains.We evaluate our approach on multiple video domain adaptation benchmarks andobserve significant improvements upon previously reported results.</description><author>Arun Reddy, William Paul, Corban Rivera, Ketul Shah, Celso M. de Melo, Rama Chellappa</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 14:53:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02914v3</guid></item><item><title>Mamba-ND: Selective State Space Modeling for Multi-Dimensional Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05892v4</link><description>In recent years, Transformers have become the de-facto architecture forsequence modeling on text and a variety of multi-dimensional data, such asimages and video.

Recent approaches address this issue bypre-training according to pseudo-labels, which align object regions with HOItriplets parsed from image captions. However, pseudo-labeling is tricky andnoisy, making HOI pre-training a complex process. Therefore, we propose anefficient disentangled pre-training method for HOI detection (DP-HOI) toaddress this problem. First, DP-HOI utilizes object detection and actionrecognition datasets to pre-train the detection and interaction decoder layers,respectively. Then, we arrange these decoder layers so that the pre-trainingarchitecture is consistent with the downstream HOI detection task. Thisfacilitates efficient knowledge transfer. Specifically, the detection decoderidentifies reliable human instances in each action recognition dataset image,generates one corresponding query, and feeds it into the interaction decoderfor verb classification. Next, we combine the human instance verb predictionsin the same image and impose image-level supervision. The DP-HOI structure canbe easily adapted to the HOI detection task, enabling effective model parameterinitialization. Therefore, it significantly enhances the performance ofexisting HOI detection models on a broad range of rare categories.

However, a persistent and significant challenge within this field isthe accurate prediction of human poses under conditions of severe occlusion.Traditional image-based estimators struggle with heavy occlusions due to a lackof temporal context, resulting in inconsistent predictions. While video-basedmodels benefit from processing temporal data, they encounter limitations whenfaced with prolonged occlusions that extend over multiple frames. Thischallenge arises because these models struggle to generalize beyond theirtraining datasets, and the variety of occlusions is hard to capture in thetraining data. Addressing these challenges, we propose STRIDE (Single-videobased TempoRally contInuous occlusion Robust 3D Pose Estimation), a novelTest-Time Training (TTT) approach to fit a human motion prior for each video.This approach specifically handles occlusions that were not encountered duringthe model's training. By employing STRIDE, we can refine a sequence of noisyinitial pose estimates into accurate, temporally coherent poses during testtime, effectively overcoming the limitations of prior methods. Our frameworkdemonstrates flexibility by being model-agnostic, allowing us to use anyoff-the-shelf 3D pose estimation method for improving robustness and temporalconsistency. We validate STRIDE's efficacy through comprehensive experiments onchallenging datasets like Occluded Human3.6M, Human3.6M, and OCMotion, where itnot only outperforms existing single-image and video-based pose estimationmodels but also showcases superior handling of substantial occlusions,achieving fast, robust, accurate, and temporally consistent 3D pose estimates.</description><author>Rohit Lal, Saketh Bachu, Yash Garg, Arindam Dutta, Calvin-Khang Ta, Dripta S.

In this paper, weintroduce Physics-aware Pretrained Transformer (PhysPT), which improveskinematics-based motion estimates and infers motion forces. PhysPT exploits aTransformer encoder-decoder backbone to effectively learn human dynamics in aself-supervised manner. Moreover, it incorporates physics principles governinghuman motion. Specifically, we build a physics-based body representation andcontact force model. We leverage them to impose novel physics-inspired traininglosses (i.e., force loss, contact loss, and Euler-Lagrange loss), enablingPhysPT to capture physical properties of the human body and the forces itexperiences. Experiments demonstrate that, once trained, PhysPT can be directlyapplied to kinematics-based estimates to significantly enhance their physicalplausibility and generate favourable motion forces. Furthermore, we show thatthese physically meaningful quantities translate into improved accuracy of animportant downstream task: human action recognition.</description><author>Yufei Zhang, Jeffrey O.

Concretely, we seek to explain thedecision-making process of video transformers based on high-level,spatiotemporal concepts that are automatically discovered. Prior research onconcept-based interpretability has concentrated solely on image-level tasks.Comparatively, video models deal with the added temporal dimension, increasingcomplexity and posing challenges in identifying dynamic concepts over time. Inthis work, we systematically address these challenges by introducing the firstVideo Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm. To this end, we proposean efficient approach for unsupervised identification of units of videotransformer representations - concepts, and ranking their importance to theoutput of a model. The resulting concepts are highly interpretable, revealingspatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations inunstructured video models. Performing this analysis jointly over a diverse setof supervised and self-supervised representations, we discover that some ofthese mechanism are universal in video transformers. Finally, we show that VTCDcan be used for fine-grained action recognition and video object segmentation.</description><author>Matthew Kowal, Achal Dave, Rares Ambrus, Adrien Gaidon, Konstantinos G.

Prompt tuning approaches involve injecting a set of learnableprompts along with data tokens during fine-tuning while keeping the backbonefrozen. This approach greatly reduces the number of learnable parameterscompared to full tuning. For image-based downstream tasks, normally a couple oflearnable prompts achieve results close to those of full tuning. However,videos, which contain more complex spatiotemporal information, require hundredsof tunable prompts to achieve reasonably good results. This reduces theparameter efficiency observed in images and significantly increases latency andthe number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) during inference. To tacklethese issues, we directly inject the prompts into the keys and values of thenon-local attention mechanism within the transformer block. Additionally, weintroduce a novel prompt reparameterization technique to make APT more robustagainst hyperparameter selection. The proposed APT approach greatly reduces thenumber of FLOPs and latency while achieving a significant performance boostover the existing parameter-efficient tuning methods on UCF101, HMDB51, andSSv2 datasets for action recognition.

Firstly, there exists a computationaland inference gap in connecting vision and language, making it difficult toaccurately determine which object a given agent acts on and represent itthrough language. Secondly, classifiers trained by a single, monolithic neuralnetwork often lack stability and generalization. To overcome these challenges,we introduce MoE-VRD, a novel approach to visual relationship detectionutilizing a mixture of experts. MoE-VRD identifies language triplets in theform of &lt; subject, predicate, object&gt; tuples to extract relationships fromvisual processing. Leveraging recent advancements in visual relationshipdetection, MoE-VRD addresses the requirement for action recognition inestablishing relationships between subjects (acting) and objects (being actedupon). In contrast to single monolithic networks, MoE-VRD employs multiplesmall models as experts, whose outputs are aggregated. Each expert in MoE-VRDspecializes in visual relationship learning and object tagging. By utilizing asparsely-gated mixture of experts, MoE-VRD enables conditional computation andsignificantly enhances neural network capacity without increasing computationalcomplexity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the conditionalcomputation capabilities and scalability of the mixture-of-experts approachlead to superior performance in visual relationship detection compared tostate-of-the-art methods.</description><author>Ala Shaabana, Zahra Gharaee, Paul Fieguth</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 19:08:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03994v1</guid></item><item><title>Learning to Score Sign Language with Two-stage Method</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10383v1</link><description>Human action recognition and performance assessment have been hot researchtopics in recent years.

Existing deeppoint cloud sequence modeling approaches imitate the mature 2D video learningmechanisms by developing complex spatio-temporal point neighbor grouping andfeature aggregation schemes, often resulting in methods lacking effectiveness,efficiency, and expressive power. In this paper, we propose a novel genericrepresentation called \textit{Structured Point Cloud Videos} (SPCVs).Intuitively, by leveraging the fact that 3D geometric shapes are essentially 2Dmanifolds, SPCV re-organizes a point cloud sequence as a 2D video with spatialsmoothness and temporal consistency, where the pixel values correspond to the3D coordinates of points. The structured nature of our SPCV representationallows for the seamless adaptation of well-established 2D image/videotechniques, enabling efficient and effective processing and analysis of 3Dpoint cloud sequences. To achieve such re-organization, we design aself-supervised learning pipeline that is geometrically regularized and drivenby self-reconstructive and deformation field learning objectives. Additionally,we construct SPCV-based frameworks for both low-level and high-level 3D pointcloud sequence processing and analysis tasks, including action recognition,temporal interpolation, and compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate theversatility and superiority of the proposed SPCV, which has the potential tooffer new possibilities for deep learning on unstructured 3D point cloudsequences.

Current methods, whileeffective, often necessitate retraining the model entirely to handle missingmodalities, making them computationally intensive, particularly with largetraining datasets. In this study, we propose a novel approach to address thisissue at test time without requiring retraining. We frame the problem as atest-time adaptation task, where the model adjusts to the available unlabeleddata at test time. Our method, MiDl~(Mutual information withself-Distillation), encourages the model to be insensitive to the specificmodality source present during testing by minimizing the mutual informationbetween the prediction and the available modality. Additionally, we incorporateself-distillation to maintain the model's original performance when bothmodalities are available. MiDl represents the first self-supervised, onlinesolution for handling missing modalities exclusively at test time.

Experts typically associate spatial action units (\aus)from a codebook to facial regions for the visual interpretation of expressions.In this paper, the same expert steps are followed. A new learning strategy isproposed to explicitly incorporate \au cues into classifier training, allowingto train deep interpretable models. During training, this \au codebook is used,along with the input image expression label, and facial landmarks, to constructa \au heatmap that indicates the most discriminative image regions of interestw.r.t the facial expression. This valuable spatial cue is leveraged to train adeep interpretable classifier for FER. This is achieved by constraining thespatial layer features of a classifier to be correlated with \au heatmaps.Using a composite loss, the classifier is trained to correctly classify animage while yielding interpretable visual layer-wise attention correlated with\au maps, simulating the expert decision process. Our strategy only relies onimage class expression for supervision, without additional manual annotations.Our new strategy is generic, and can be applied to any deep CNN- ortransformer-based classifier without requiring any architectural change orsignificant additional training time. Our extensive evaluation on two publicbenchmarks \rafdb, and \affectnet datasets shows that our proposed strategy canimprove layer-wise interpretability without degrading classificationperformance.

This study focuses on monitoring students' emotionsin the classroom as an indicator of their engagement and proposes an approachto address this issue. The impact of different facial parts on the performanceof an emotional recognition model is evaluated through experimentation. To testthe proposed model under partial occlusion, an artificially occluded dataset isintroduced. The novelty of this work lies in the proposal of an occlusion-awarearchitecture for facial action units (AUs) extraction, which employs attentionmechanism and adaptive feature learning. The AUs can be used later to classifyfacial expressions in classroom settings. This research paper's findings provide valuable insights into handlingocclusion in analyzing facial images for emotional engagement analysis. Theproposed experiments demonstrate the significance of considering occlusion andenhancing the reliability of facial analysis models in classroom environments.These findings can also be extended to other settings where occlusions areprevalent.</description><author>Shrouk Wally, Ahmed Elsayed, Islam Alkabbany, Asem Ali, Aly Farag</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 03:17:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09465v2</guid></item><item><title>Riemannian Multinomial Logistics Regression for SPD Neural Networks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11288v2</link><description>Deep neural networks for learning Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matricesare gaining increasing attention in machine learning. Despite the significantprogress, most existing SPD networks use traditional Euclidean classifiers onan approximated space rather than intrinsic classifiers that accurately capturethe geometry of SPD manifolds. Inspired by Hyperbolic Neural Networks (HNNs),we propose Riemannian Multinomial Logistics Regression (RMLR) for theclassification layers in SPD networks. We introduce a unified framework forbuilding Riemannian classifiers under the metrics pulled back from theEuclidean space, and showcase our framework under the parameterizedLog-Euclidean Metric (LEM) and Log-Cholesky Metric (LCM).

However, traditional approaches primarily deploymodels to discriminate among discrete emotion categories, and lack the finegranularity and reasoning capability for complex facial behaviors. The adventof Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has been proven successful ingeneral visual understanding tasks. However, directly harnessing MLLMs for FABAis challenging due to the scarcity of datasets and benchmarks, neglectingfacial prior knowledge, and low training efficiency. To address thesechallenges, we introduce (i) an instruction-following dataset for two FABAtasks, e.g., emotion and action unit recognition, (ii) a benchmark FABA-Benchwith a new metric considering both recognition and generation ability, and(iii) a new MLLM "EmoLA" as a strong baseline to the community. Our initiativeon the dataset and benchmarks reveal the nature and rationale of facialaffective behaviors, i.e., fine-grained facial movement, interpretability, andreasoning. Moreover, to build an effective and efficient FABA MLLM, weintroduce a facial prior expert module with face structure knowledge and alow-rank adaptation module into pre-trained MLLM. We conduct extensiveexperiments on FABA-Bench and four commonly-used FABA datasets. The resultsdemonstrate that the proposed facial prior expert can boost the performance andEmoLA achieves the best results on our FABA-Bench. On commonly-used FABAdatasets, EmoLA is competitive rivaling task-specific state-of-the-art models.</description><author>Yifan Li, Anh Dao, Wentao Bao, Zhen Tan, Tianlong Chen, Huan Liu, Yu Kong</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2024 20:23:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05052v1</guid></item><item><title>A Lie Group Approach to Riemannian Batch Normalization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11261v1</link><description>Manifold-valued measurements exist in numerous applications within computervision and machine learning. Recent studies have extended Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) to manifolds, and concomitantly, normalization techniques have also beenadapted to several manifolds, referred to as Riemannian normalization.Nonetheless, most of the existing Riemannian normalization methods have beenderived in an ad hoc manner and only apply to specific manifolds. This paperestablishes a unified framework for Riemannian Batch Normalization (RBN)techniques on Lie groups. Our framework offers the theoretical guarantee ofcontrolling both the Riemannian mean and variance. Empirically, we focus onSymmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifolds, which possess three distinct typesof Lie group structures. Using the deformation concept, we generalize theexisting Lie groups on SPD manifolds into three families of parameterized Liegroups. Specific normalization layers induced by these Lie groups are thenproposed for SPD neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ourapproach through three sets of experiments: radar recognition, human actionrecognition, and electroencephalography (EEG) classification.

This study aims toinvestigate the correlation between two continuous sensor streams, pupildiameter as an indicator of cognitive workload and FACTs with deep learning asan indicator of emotional arousal (RQ 1a), specifically for epochs of high,medium, and low arousal (RQ 1b). Furthermore, the time lag between emotionalarousal and pupil diameter data will be analyzed (RQ 2). 28 participants workedon three cognitively demanding and emotionally engaging everyday moral dilemmaswhile eye-tracking and emotion recognition data were collected. The data werepre-processed in Phyton (synchronization, blink control, downsampling) andanalyzed using correlation analysis and Granger causality tests. The resultsshow negative and statistically significant correlations between the datastreams for emotional arousal and pupil diameter. However, the correlation isnegative and significant only for epochs of high arousal, while positive butnon-significant relationships were found for epochs of medium or low arousal.The average time lag for the relationship between arousal and pupil diameterwas 2.8 ms. In contrast to previous findings without a multimodal approachsuggesting a positive correlation between the constructs, the resultscontribute to the state of research by highlighting the importance ofmultimodal data validation and research on convergent vagility.

Unlike simple recognition tasks, grounded situation recognition(GSR) requires the model not only to classify salient activity (verb) in theimage, but also to detect all semantic roles that participate in the action.This complex task usually involves three steps: verb recognition, semantic rolegrounding, and noun recognition. Directly employing class-based prompts withVLMs and grounding models for this task suffers from several limitations, e.g.,it struggles to distinguish ambiguous verb concepts, accurately localize roleswith fixed verb-centric template1 input, and achieve context-aware nounpredictions. In this paper, we argue that these limitations stem from themode's poor understanding of verb/noun classes. To this end, we introduce a newapproach for zero-shot GSR via Language EXplainer (LEX), which significantlyboosts the model's comprehensive capabilities through three explainers: 1) verbexplainer, which generates general verb-centric descriptions to enhance thediscriminability of different verb classes; 2) grounding explainer, whichrephrases verb-centric templates for clearer understanding, thereby enhancingprecise semantic role localization; and 3) noun explainer, which createsscene-specific noun descriptions to ensure context-aware noun recognition. Byequipping each step of the GSR process with an auxiliary explainer, LEXfacilitates complex scene understanding in real-world scenarios. Our extensivevalidations on the SWiG dataset demonstrate LEX's effectiveness andinteroperability in zero-shot GSR.</description><author>Jiaming Lei, Lin Li, Chunping Wang, Jun Xiao, Long Chen</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 11:17:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15785v1</guid></item><item><title>Reasoning over the Behaviour of Objects in Video-Clips for Adverb-Type Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04132v3</link><description>In this work, following the intuition that adverbs describing scene-sequencesare best identified by reasoning over high-level concepts of object-behavior,we propose the design of a new framework that reasons over object-behavioursextracted from raw-video-clips to recognize the clip's correspondingadverb-types.

In this study, we revealed from exploratory data analysis thatsurgical videos enjoy relatively simple semantic structure, where the presenceof surgical phases and tools can be well modeled by a compact hidden Markovmodel (HMM). Based on this observation, we propose an HMM-stabilized deeplearning method for tool presence detection. A wide range of experimentsconfirm that the proposed approaches achieve better performance with lowertraining and running costs, and support more flexible ways to construct andutilize training data in scenarios where not all surgery videos of interest areextensively labelled.

Yet, it remains unclear how to adapt these pre-trainedshort-term ViTs for temporal action detection (TAD) in untrimmed videos. Theexisting works treat them as off-the-shelf feature extractors for eachshort-trimmed snippet without capturing the fine-grained relation amongdifferent snippets in a broader temporal context. To mitigate this issue, thispaper focuses on designing a new mechanism for adapting these pre-trained ViTmodels as a unified long-form video transformer to fully unleash its modelingpower in capturing inter-snippet relation, while still keeping low computationoverhead and memory consumption for efficient TAD. To this end, we designeffective cross-snippet propagation modules to gradually exchange short-termvideo information among different snippets from two levels. For inner-backboneinformation propagation, we introduce a cross-snippet propagation strategy toenable multi-snippet temporal feature interaction inside the backbone.Forpost-backbone information propagation, we propose temporal transformer layersfor further clip-level modeling.

However,the prevailing defenses depend on single observation or pre-establishedadversary information to counter adversarial patches, often failing to beconfronted with unseen or adaptive adversarial attacks and easily exhibitingunsatisfying performance in dynamic 3D environments. Inspired by active humanperception and recurrent feedback mechanisms, we develop Embodied ActiveDefense (EAD), a proactive defensive strategy that actively contextualizesenvironmental information to address misaligned adversarial patches in 3Dreal-world settings. To achieve this, EAD develops two central recurrentsub-modules, i.e., a perception module and a policy module, to implement twocritical functions of active vision. These models recurrently process a seriesof beliefs and observations, facilitating progressive refinement of theircomprehension of the target object and enabling the development of strategicactions to counter adversarial patches in 3D environments. To optimize learningefficiency, we incorporate a differentiable approximation of environmentaldynamics and deploy patches that are agnostic to the adversary strategies.Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAD substantially enhances robustnessagainst a variety of patches within just a few steps through its action policyin safety-critical tasks (e.g., face recognition and object detection), withoutcompromising standard accuracy. Furthermore, due to the attack-agnosticcharacteristic, EAD facilitates excellent generalization to unseen attacks,diminishing the averaged attack success rate by 95 percent across a range ofunseen adversarial attacks.</description><author>Lingxuan Wu, Xiao Yang, Yinpeng Dong, Liuwei Xie, Hang Su, Jun Zhu</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 04:02:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00540v1</guid></item><item><title>Ain't Misbehavin' -- Using LLMs to Generate Expressive Robot Behavior in Conversations with the Tabletop Robot Haru</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11571v1</link><description>Social robots aim to establish long-term bonds with humans through engagingconversation.

However, the effectiveness of region features is susceptible to personlocalization and variable semantics of individual actions. To overcome theseissues, we propose leveraging attention modules in transformers to generatesocial group features. In this method, multiple embeddings are used toaggregate features for a social group, each of which is assigned to a groupmember without duplication. Due to this non-duplicated assignment, the numberof embeddings must be significant to avoid missing group members and thusrenders attention in transformers ineffective. To find optimal attentiondesigns with a large number of embeddings, we explore several design choices ofqueries for feature aggregation and self-attention modules in transformerdecoders.

The pre-trained model servesas an adept visual feature extractor, thereby enhancing the model's robustness.Furthermore, we bolster the performance of continuous emotion recognition byintegrating Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) modules and TransformerEncoder modules into our framework.</description><author>Weiwei Zhou, Jiada Lu, Chenkun Ling, Weifeng Wang, Shaowei Liu</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 04:28:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11440v1</guid></item><item><title>Hybrid LLM/Rule-based Approaches to Business Insights Generation from Structured Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15604v1</link><description>In the field of business data analysis, the ability to extract actionableinsights from vast and varied datasets is essential for informeddecision-making and maintaining a competitive edge. Traditional rule-basedsystems, while reliable, often fall short when faced with the complexity anddynamism of modern business data. Conversely, Artificial Intelligence (AI)models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer significant potentialin pattern recognition and predictive analytics but can lack the precisionnecessary for specific business applications. This paper explores the efficacyof hybrid approaches that integrate the robustness of rule-based systems withthe adaptive power of LLMs in generating actionable business insights.</description><author>Aliaksei Vertsel, Mikhail Rumiantsau</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 03:42:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15604v1</guid></item></channel></rss>

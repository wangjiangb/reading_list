However, these modelsexhibit a key limitation: they necessitate complete action observation prior toclassification, which constrains their applicability in real-time situationssuch as surveillance and robotic systems. To overcome this barrier, weintroduce InfoGCN++, an innovative extension of InfoGCN, explicitly developedfor online skeleton-based action recognition. InfoGCN++ augments the abilitiesof the original InfoGCN model by allowing real-time categorization of actiontypes, independent of the observation sequence's length. It transcendsconventional approaches by learning from current and anticipated futuremovements, thereby creating a more thorough representation of the entiresequence. Our approach to prediction is managed as an extrapolation issue,grounded on observed actions. To enable this, InfoGCN++ incorporates NeuralOrdinary Differential Equations, a concept that lets it effectively model thecontinuous evolution of hidden states. Following rigorous evaluations on threeskeleton-based action recognition benchmarks, InfoGCN++ demonstratesexceptional performance in online action recognition. It consistently equals orexceeds existing techniques, highlighting its significant potential to reshapethe landscape of real-time action recognition applications. Consequently, thiswork represents a major leap forward from InfoGCN, pushing the limits of what'spossible in online, skeleton-based action recognition. The code for InfoGCN++is publicly available at https://github.com/stnoah1/infogcn2 for furtherexploration and validation.</description><author>Seunggeun Chi, Hyung-gun Chi, Qixing Huang, Karthik Ramani</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 17:15:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10547v1</guid></item><item><title>Balanced Representation Learning for Long-tailed Skeleton-based Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14024v1</link><description>Skeleton-based action recognition has recently made significant progress.However, data imbalance is still a great challenge in real-world scenarios. Theperformance of current action recognition algorithms declines sharply whentraining data suffers from heavy class imbalance. The imbalanced data actuallydegrades the representations learned by these methods and becomes thebottleneck for action recognition. How to learn unbiased representations fromimbalanced action data is the key to long-tailed action recognition. In thispaper, we propose a novel balanced representation learning method to addressthe long-tailed problem in action recognition. Firstly, a spatial-temporalaction exploration strategy is presented to expand the sample spaceeffectively, generating more valuable samples in a rebalanced manner. Secondly,we design a detached action-aware learning schedule to further mitigate thebias in the representation space. The schedule detaches the representationlearning of tail classes from training and proposes an action-aware loss toimpose more effective constraints. Additionally, a skip-modal representation isproposed to provide complementary structural information. The proposed methodis validated on four skeleton datasets, NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA,and Kinetics. It not only achieves consistently large improvement compared tothe state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also demonstrates a superiorgeneralization capacity through extensive experiments.

However, existingmethods inadequately exploit these two information sources. In terms ofintra-video information, current sampling operations for input videos may omitcritical action information, reducing the utilization efficiency of video data.For the inter-video information, the action misalignment among videos makes itchallenging to calculate precise relationships. Moreover, how to jointlyconsider both inter- and intra-video information remains under-explored forfew-shot action recognition. To this end, we propose a novel framework, VideoInformation Maximization (VIM), for few-shot video action recognition. VIM isequipped with an adaptive spatial-temporal video sampler and a spatiotemporalaction alignment model to maximize intra- and inter-video information,respectively. The video sampler adaptively selects important frames andamplifies critical spatial regions for each input video based on the task athand. This preserves and emphasizes informative parts of video clips whileeliminating interference at the data level. The alignment model performstemporal and spatial action alignment sequentially at the feature level,leading to more precise measurements of inter-video similarity. Finally, Thesegoals are facilitated by incorporating additional loss terms based on mutualinformation measurement. Consequently, VIM acts to maximize the distinctivenessof video information from limited video data. Extensive experimental results onpublic datasets for few-shot action recognition demonstrate the effectivenessand benefits of our framework.</description><author>Huabin Liu, Weiyao Lin, Tieyuan Chen, Yuxi Li, Shuyuan Li, John See</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 14:05:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06114v1</guid></item><item><title>Hierarchical Compositional Representations for Few-shot Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09424v2</link><description>Recently action recognition has received more and more attention for itscomprehensive and practical applications in intelligent surveillance andhuman-computer interaction. However, few-shot action recognition has not beenwell explored and remains challenging because of data scarcity. In this paper,we propose a novel hierarchical compositional representations (HCR) learningapproach for few-shot action recognition. Specifically, we divide a complicatedaction into several sub-actions by carefully designed hierarchical clusteringand further decompose the sub-actions into more fine-grained spatiallyattentional sub-actions (SAS-actions). Although there exist large differencesbetween base classes and novel classes, they can share similar patterns insub-actions or SAS-actions. Furthermore, we adopt the Earth Mover's Distance inthe transportation problem to measure the similarity between video samples interms of sub-action representations. It computes the optimal matching flowsbetween sub-actions as distance metric, which is favorable for comparingfine-grained patterns. Extensive experiments show our method achieves thestate-of-the-art results on HMDB51, UCF101 and Kinetics datasets.</description><author>Changzhen Li, Jie Zhang, Shuzhe Wu, Xin Jin, Shiguang Shan</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 03:46:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09424v2</guid></item><item><title>Local Spherical Harmonics Improve Skeleton-Based Hand Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10557v1</link><description>Hand action recognition is essential.

In this research project, the performance of fouraforementioned algorithms will be analyzed and evaluated using five benchmarkdatasets, which cover challenging issues such as noise, change of viewpoints,background clutters and occlusions. We also implemented and improved the HDGalgorithm, and applied it in cross-view action recognition using the UWA3DMultiview Activity dataset.

However, most existing studies match skeleton sequences bycomparing their feature vectors directly which neglects spatial structures andtemporal orders of skeleton data. This paper presents a novel one-shot skeletonaction recognition technique that handles skeleton action recognition viamulti-scale spatial-temporal feature matching. We represent skeleton data atmultiple spatial and temporal scales and achieve optimal feature matching fromtwo perspectives. The first is multi-scale matching which captures thescale-wise semantic relevance of skeleton data at multiple spatial and temporalscales simultaneously. The second is cross-scale matching which handlesdifferent motion magnitudes and speeds by capturing sample-wise relevanceacross multiple scales. Extensive experiments over three large-scale datasets(NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD) show that our method achieves superiorone-shot skeleton action recognition, and it outperforms the state-of-the-artconsistently by large margins.</description><author>Siyuan Yang, Jun Liu, Shijian Lu, Er Meng Hwa, Alex C.

However,privacy issues prevent widespread usage due to the inclusion of privateinformation, such as visible faces and scene backgrounds, which are notnecessary for recognizing user action. In this paper, we propose aprivacy-preserving action recognition by ultrasound active sensing. As actionrecognition from ultrasound active sensing in a non-invasive manner is not wellinvestigated, we create a new dataset for action recognition and conduct acomparison of features for classification. We calculated feature values byfocusing on the temporal variation of the amplitude of ultrasound reflectedwaves and performed classification using a support vector machine and VGG foreight fundamental action classes. We confirmed that our method achieved anaccuracy of 97.9% when trained and evaluated on the same person and in the sameenvironment. Additionally, our method achieved an accuracy of 89.5% even whentrained and evaluated on different people.

While mostcomputer vision approaches prioritize the RGB camera, the Depth modality -which can further amplify the subtleties of actions from an egocentricperspective - remains underexplored. Our work focuses on recognizing actionsfrom egocentric RGB and Depth modalities in an industry-like environment. Tostudy this problem, we consider the recent MECCANO dataset, which provides awide range of assembling actions. Our framework is based on the 3D Video SWINTransformer to encode both RGB and Depth modalities effectively. To address theinherent skewness in real-world multimodal action occurrences, we propose atraining strategy using an exponentially decaying variant of the focal lossmodulating factor. Additionally, to leverage the information in both RGB andDepth modalities, we opt for late fusion to combine the predictions from eachmodality. We thoroughly evaluate our method on the action recognition task ofthe MECCANO dataset, and it significantly outperforms the prior work. Notably,our method also secured first place at the multimodal action recognitionchallenge at ICIAP 2023.</description><author>Jyoti Kini, Sarah Fleischer, Ishan Dave, Mubarak Shah</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 09:56:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13962v1</guid></item><item><title>Cross-Modal Learning with 3D Deformable Attention for Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05638v3</link><description>An important challenge in vision-based action recognition is the embedding ofspatiotemporal features with two or more heterogeneous modalities into a singlefeature. In this study, we propose a new 3D deformable transformer for actionrecognition with adaptive spatiotemporal receptive fields and a cross-modallearning scheme. The 3D deformable transformer consists of three attentionmodules: 3D deformability, local joint stride, and temporal stride attention.The two cross-modal tokens are input into the 3D deformable attention module tocreate a cross-attention token with a reflected spatiotemporal correlation.Local joint stride attention is applied to spatially combine attention and posetokens. Temporal stride attention temporally reduces the number of input tokensin the attention module and supports temporal expression learning without thesimultaneous use of all tokens. The deformable transformer iterates L-times andcombines the last cross-modal token for classification. The proposed 3Ddeformable transformer was tested on the NTU60, NTU120, FineGYM, and PennActiondatasets, and showed results better than or similar to pre-trainedstate-of-the-art methods even without a pre-training process. In addition, byvisualizing important joints and correlations during action recognition throughspatial joint and temporal stride attention, the possibility of achieving anexplainable potential for action recognition is presented.</description><author>Sangwon Kim, Dasom Ahn, Byoung Chul Ko</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 08:23:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05638v3</guid></item><item><title>Flow Dynamics Correction for Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10059v1</link><description>Various research studies indicate that action recognition performance highlydepends on the types of motions being extracted and how accurate the humanactions are represented.

Humans can abstract awaythe action from the appearance of the objects and their context which isreferred to as compositionality of actions. Compositional action recognitiondeals with imparting human-like compositional generalization abilities toaction-recognition models. In this regard, extracting the interactions betweenhumans and objects forms the basis of compositional understanding. Theseinteractions are not affected by the appearance biases of the objects or thecontext. But the context provides additional cues about the interactionsbetween things and stuff. Hence we need to infuse context into the human-objectinteractions for compositional action recognition. To this end, we first designa spatial-temporal interaction encoder that captures the human-object (things)interactions. The encoder learns the spatio-temporal interaction tokensdisentangled from the background context. The interaction tokens are theninfused with contextual information from the video tokens to model theinteractions between things and stuff. The final context-infusedspatio-temporal interaction tokens are used for compositional actionrecognition. We show the effectiveness of our interaction-centric approach onthe compositional Something-Else dataset where we obtain a new state-of-the-artresult of 83.8% top-1 accuracy outperforming recent important object-centricmethods by a significant margin. Our approach of explicit human-object-stuffinteraction modeling is effective even for standard action recognition datasetssuch as Something-Something-V2 and Epic-Kitchens-100 where we obtain comparableor better performance than state-of-the-art.</description><author>Ramanathan Rajendiran, Debaditya Roy, Basura Fernando</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 10:37:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02673v1</guid></item><item><title>M$^3$Net: Multi-view Encoding, Matching, and Fusion for Few-shot Fine-grained Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03063v1</link><description>Due to the scarcity of manually annotated data required for fine-grainedvideo understanding, few-shot fine-grained (FS-FG) action recognition hasgained significant attention, with the aim of classifying novel fine-grainedaction categories with only a few labeled instances. Despite the progress madein FS coarse-grained action recognition, current approaches encounter twochallenges when dealing with the fine-grained action categories: the inabilityto capture subtle action details and the insufficiency of learning from limiteddata that exhibit high intra-class variance and inter-class similarity. Toaddress these limitations, we propose M$^3$Net, a matching-based framework forFS-FG action recognition, which incorporates \textit{multi-view encoding},\textit{multi-view matching}, and \textit{multi-view fusion} to facilitateembedding encoding, similarity matching, and decision making across multipleviewpoints. \textit{Multi-view encoding} captures rich contextual details fromthe intra-frame, intra-video, and intra-episode perspectives, generatingcustomized higher-order embeddings for fine-grained data. \textit{Multi-viewmatching} integrates various matching functions enabling flexible relationmodeling within limited samples to handle multi-scale spatio-temporalvariations by leveraging the instance-specific, category-specific, andtask-specific perspectives. \textit{Multi-view fusion} consists ofmatching-predictions fusion and matching-losses fusion over the above views,where the former promotes mutual complementarity and the latter enhancesembedding generalizability by employing multi-task collaborative learning.Explainable visualizations and experimental results on three challengingbenchmarks demonstrate the superiority of M$^3$Net in capturing fine-grainedaction details and achieving state-of-the-art performance for FS-FG actionrecognition.</description><author>Hao Tang, Jun Liu, Shuanglin Yan, Rui Yan, Zechao Li, Jinhui Tang</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 10:15:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03063v1</guid></item><item><title>On the Importance of Spatial Relations for Few-shot Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07119v1</link><description>Deep learning has achieved great success in video recognition, yet stillstruggles to recognize novel actions when faced with only a few examples. Totackle this challenge, few-shot action recognition methods have been proposedto transfer knowledge from a source dataset to a novel target dataset with onlyone or a few labeled videos. However, existing methods mainly focus on modelingthe temporal relations between the query and support videos while ignoring thespatial relations. In this paper, we find that the spatial misalignment betweenobjects also occurs in videos, notably more common than the temporalinconsistency. We are thus motivated to investigate the importance of spatialrelations and propose a more accurate few-shot action recognition method thatleverages both spatial and temporal information. Particularly, a novel SpatialAlignment Cross Transformer (SA-CT) which learns to re-adjust the spatialrelations and incorporates the temporal information is contributed. Experimentsreveal that, even without using any temporal information, the performance ofSA-CT is comparable to temporal based methods on 3/4 benchmarks. To furtherincorporate the temporal information, we propose a simple yet effectiveTemporal Mixer module. The Temporal Mixer enhances the video representation andimproves the performance of the full SA-CT model, achieving very competitiveresults. In this work, we also exploit large-scale pretrained models forfew-shot action recognition, providing useful insights for this researchdirection.</description><author>Yilun Zhang, Yuqian Fu, Xingjun Ma, Lizhe Qi, Jingjing Chen, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2023 13:58:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07119v1</guid></item><item><title>Position and Orientation-Aware One-Shot Learning for Medical Action Recognition from Signal Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15635v1</link><description>In this work, we propose a position and orientation-aware one-shot learningframework for medical action recognition from signal data.

Many recentmethods have achieved remarkable performance using graph convolutional networks(GCNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which extract spatial andtemporal features, respectively. Although spatial and temporal dependencies inthe human skeleton have been explored separately, spatio-temporal dependency israrely considered. In this paper, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Curve Network(STC-Net) to effectively leverage the spatio-temporal dependency of the humanskeleton. Our proposed network consists of two novel elements: 1) TheSpatio-Temporal Curve (STC) module; and 2) Dilated Kernels for GraphConvolution (DK-GC). The STC module dynamically adjusts the receptive field byidentifying meaningful node connections between every adjacent frame andgenerating spatio-temporal curves based on the identified node connections,providing an adaptive spatio-temporal coverage. In addition, we propose DK-GCto consider long-range dependencies, which results in a large receptive fieldwithout any additional parameters by applying an extended kernel to the givenadjacency matrices of the graph. Our STC-Net combines these two modules andachieves state-of-the-art performance on four skeleton-based action recognitionbenchmarks.</description><author>Jungho Lee, Minhyeok Lee, Suhwan Cho, Sungmin Woo, Sungjun Jang, Sangyoun Lee</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 03:20:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04761v2</guid></item><item><title>Baby Physical Safety Monitoring in Smart Home Using Action Recognition System</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12527v2</link><description>Humans are able to intuitively deduce actions that took place between twostates in observations via deductive reasoning.

As with most action recognition tasks, the ambiguity of accuratelydescribing activities in spatial-temporal data is a drawback that can beovercome by curating suitable datasets, including careful annotations andpreprocessing of video data for analyzing various recognition tasks. In thisstudy, we present a novel lightweight framework combining transfer learningtechniques with a Conv2D LSTM layer to extract features from the pre-trainedI3D model on the Kinetics dataset for a new AR task (Smart Baby Care) thatrequires a smaller dataset and less computational resources. Furthermore, wedeveloped a benchmark dataset and an automated model that uses LSTM convolutionwith I3D (ConvLSTM-I3D) for recognizing and predicting baby activities in asmart baby room. Finally, we implemented video augmentation to improve modelperformance on the smart baby care task. Compared to other benchmark models,our experimental framework achieved better performance with less computationalresources.</description><author>Victor Adewopo, Nelly Elsayed, Kelly Anderson</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 02:17:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12527v2</guid></item><item><title>SkeleTR: Towrads Skeleton-based Action Recognition in the Wild</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11445v1</link><description>We present SkeleTR, a new framework for skeleton-based action recognition.

SkeleTR works with atwo-stage paradigm. It first models the intra-person skeleton dynamics for eachskeleton sequence with graph convolutions, and then uses stacked Transformerencoders to capture person interactions that are important for actionrecognition in general scenarios. To mitigate the negative impact of inaccurateskeleton associations, SkeleTR takes relative short skeleton sequences as inputand increases the number of sequences. As a unified solution, SkeleTR can bedirectly applied to multiple skeleton-based action tasks, including video-levelaction classification, instance-level action detection, and group-levelactivity recognition. It also enables transfer learning and joint trainingacross different action tasks and datasets, which result in performanceimprovement.

The key is tobuild the connection between visual and semantic space from seen to unseenclasses. Previous studies have primarily focused on encoding sequences into asingular feature vector, with subsequent mapping the features to an identicalanchor point within the embedded space. Their performance is hindered by 1) theignorance of the global visual/semantic distribution alignment, which resultsin a limitation to capture the true interdependence between the two spaces. 2)the negligence of temporal information since the frame-wise features with richaction clues are directly pooled into a single feature vector. We propose a newzero-shot skeleton-based action recognition method via mutual information (MI)estimation and maximization. Specifically, 1) we maximize the MI between visualand semantic space for distribution alignment; 2) we leverage the temporalinformation for estimating the MI by encouraging MI to increase as more framesare observed. Extensive experiments on three large-scale skeleton actiondatasets confirm the effectiveness of our method.

As a result, researchers began to notice the importance of using RGB orother sensors to analyze human action by extracting skeleton information.Leveraging the rapid development of deep learning (DL), a significant number ofskeleton-based human action approaches have been presented with fine-designedDL structures recently. However, a well-trained DL model always demandshigh-quality and sufficient data, which is hard to obtain without costing highexpenses and human labor. In this paper, we introduce a novel data augmentationmethod for skeleton-based action recognition tasks, which can effectivelygenerate high-quality and diverse sequential actions. In order to obtainnatural and realistic action sequences, we propose denoising diffusionprobabilistic models (DDPMs) that can generate a series of synthetic actionsequences, and their generation process is precisely guided by aspatial-temporal transformer (ST-Trans). Experimental results show that ourmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) motion generation approaches ondifferent naturality and diversity metrics.

This requiresactor-specific pose estimation (e.g., humans vs. animals), leading tocumbersome model design complexity and high maintenance costs. Moreover, theyoften focus on learning the visual modality alone and single-labelclassification whilst neglecting other available information sources (e.g.,class name text) and the concurrent occurrence of multiple actions. To overcomethese limitations, we propose a new approach called 'actor-agnostic multi-modalmulti-label action recognition,' which offers a unified solution for varioustypes of actors, including humans and animals. We further formulate a novelMulti-modal Semantic Query Network (MSQNet) model in a transformer-based objectdetection framework (e.g., DETR), characterized by leveraging visual andtextual modalities to represent the action classes better. The elimination ofactor-specific model designs is a key advantage, as it removes the need foractor pose estimation altogether. Extensive experiments on five publiclyavailable benchmarks show that our MSQNet consistently outperforms the priorarts of actor-specific alternatives on human and animal single- and multi-labelaction recognition tasks by up to 50%.

In this paper, we propose a graph contrastive learningframework for skeleton-based action recognition (\textit{SkeletonGCL}) toexplore the \textit{global} context across all sequences. In specific,SkeletonGCL associates graph learning across sequences by enforcing graphs tobe class-discriminative, \emph{i.e.,} intra-class compact and inter-classdispersed, which improves the GCN capacity to distinguish various actionpatterns. Besides, two memory banks are designed to enrich cross-sequencecontext from two complementary levels, \emph{i.e.,} instance and semanticlevels, enabling graph contrastive learning in multiple context scales.Consequently, SkeletonGCL establishes a new training paradigm, and it can beseamlessly incorporated into current GCNs.

In this work, we investigate whetherwe can improve the model robustness to the sub-action order by shrinking thetemporal receptive field of action recognition models. For this, we designVideo BagNet, a variant of the 3D ResNet-50 model with the temporal receptivefield size limited to 1, 9, 17 or 33 frames. We analyze Video BagNet onsynthetic and real-world video datasets and experimentally compare models withvarying temporal receptive fields.

With the limitation in thescale of egocentric data collection, learning robust deep learning-based actionrecognition models remains difficult. Transferring knowledge learned from thelarge-scale exocentric data to the egocentric data is challenging due to thedifference in videos across views. Our work introduces a novel cross-viewlearning approach to action recognition (CVAR) that effectively transfersknowledge from the exocentric to the egocentric view. First, we introduce anovel geometric-based constraint into the self-attention mechanism inTransformer based on analyzing the camera positions between two views.

This ability is crucial forcobots to act autonomously and assist in assembly tasks. Recently,skeleton-based approaches are often used as they tend to generalize better todifferent people and environments. However, when processing skeletons alone,information about the objects a human interacts with is lost. Therefore, wepresent a novel approach of integrating object information into skeleton-basedaction recognition.

In Ske2Grid, we define a regularconvolution operation upon a novel grid representation of human skeleton, whichis a compact image-like grid patch constructed and learned through three noveldesigns. Specifically, we propose a graph-node index transform (GIT) toconstruct a regular grid patch through assigning the nodes in the skeletongraph one by one to the desired grid cells. To ensure that GIT is a bijectionand enrich the expressiveness of the grid representation, an up-samplingtransform (UPT) is learned to interpolate the skeleton graph nodes for fillingthe grid patch to the full. To resolve the problem when the one-step UPT isaggressive and further exploit the representation capability of the grid patchwith increasing spatial size, a progressive learning strategy (PLS) is proposedwhich decouples the UPT into multiple steps and aligns them to multiple pairedGITs through a compact cascaded design learned progressively.

Nevertheless, deep models often sufferfrom the overfitting effect on small-scale datasets with a limited number oftraining videos. A common solution is to exploit the existing imageaugmentation strategies for each frame individually including Mixup, Cutmix,and RandAugment, which are not particularly optimized for video data. In thispaper, we propose a novel video augmentation strategy named Selective VolumeMixup (SV-Mix) to improve the generalization ability of deep models withlimited training videos. SV-Mix devises a learnable selective module to choosethe most informative volumes from two videos and mixes the volumes up toachieve a new training video. Technically, we propose two new modules, i.e., aspatial selective module to select the local patches for each spatial position,and a temporal selective module to mix the entire frames for each timestamp andmaintain the spatial pattern. At each time, we randomly choose one of the twomodules to expand the diversity of training samples. The selective modules arejointly optimized with the video action recognition framework to find theoptimal augmentation strategy. We empirically demonstrate the merits of theSV-Mix augmentation on a wide range of video action recognition benchmarks andconsistently boot the performances of both CNN-based and transformer-basedmodels.</description><author>Yi Tan, Zhaofan Qiu, Yanbin Hao, Ting Yao, Xiangnan He, Tao Mei</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 08:26:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09534v1</guid></item><item><title>FMM-X3D: FPGA-based modeling and mapping of X3D for Human Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18479v1</link><description>3D Convolutional Neural Networks are gaining increasing attention fromresearchers and practitioners and have found applications in many domains, suchas surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, human monitoring systems, andvideo retrieval.

Most of the existing work focuses on supervised learning whichrequires a large number of labeled action sequences that are often expensiveand time-consuming to annotate. In this paper, we address self-supervised 3Daction representation learning for skeleton-based action recognition. Weinvestigate self-supervised representation learning and design a novel skeletoncloud colorization technique that is capable of learning spatial and temporalskeleton representations from unlabeled skeleton sequence data. We represent askeleton action sequence as a 3D skeleton cloud and colorize each point in thecloud according to its temporal and spatial orders in the original(unannotated) skeleton sequence. Leveraging the colorized skeleton point cloud,we design an auto-encoder framework that can learn spatial-temporal featuresfrom the artificial color labels of skeleton joints effectively. Specifically,we design a two-steam pretraining network that leverages fine-grained andcoarse-grained colorization to learn multi-scale spatial-temporal features.

At the core of MAiVAR-T lies the significance of distillingsubstantial representations from the audio modality and transmuting these intothe image domain. Subsequently, this audio-image depiction is fused with thevideo modality to formulate a unified representation. This concerted approachstrives to exploit the contextual richness inherent in both audio and videomodalities, thereby promoting action recognition. In contrast to existingstate-of-the-art strategies that focus solely on audio or video modalities,MAiVAR-T demonstrates superior performance.

WhileConvolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have shown remarkable success in imagerecognition, they are not always directly applicable to HAR, as temporalfeatures are critical for accurate classification. In this paper, we propose anovel dynamic PSO-ConvNet model for learning actions in videos, building on ourrecent work in image recognition. Our approach leverages a framework where theweight vector of each neural network represents the position of a particle inphase space, and particles share their current weight vectors and gradientestimates of the Loss function. To extend our approach to video, we integrateConvNets with state-of-the-art temporal methods such as Transformer andRecurrent Neural Networks. Our experimental results on the UCF-101 datasetdemonstrate substantial improvements of up to 9% in accuracy, which confirmsthe effectiveness of our proposed method. In addition, we conducted experimentson larger and more variety of datasets including Kinetics-400 and HMDB-51 andobtained preference for Collaborative Learning in comparison withNon-Collaborative Learning (Individual Learning). Overall, our dynamicPSO-ConvNet model provides a promising direction for improving HAR by bettercapturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of human actions in videos.

The current state-of-the-art enablessuch a zero-shot recognition by learning universal mappings from videos to asemantic space, either trained on large-scale seen actions or on objects. Whileeffective, we find that universal action and object mappings are biased tospecific regions in the semantic space. These biases lead to a fundamentalproblem: many unseen action categories are simply never inferred duringtesting. For example on UCF-101, a quarter of the unseen actions are out ofreach with a state-of-the-art universal action model. To that end, this paperintroduces universal prototype transport for zero-shot action recognition. Themain idea is to re-position the semantic prototypes of unseen actions bymatching them to the distribution of all test videos. For universal actionmodels, we propose to match distributions through a hyperspherical optimaltransport from unseen action prototypes to the set of all projected testvideos. The resulting transport couplings in turn determine the targetprototype for each unseen action. Rather than directly using the targetprototype as final result, we re-position unseen action prototypes along thegeodesic spanned by the original and target prototypes as a form of semanticregularization. For universal object models, we outline a variant that definestarget prototypes based on an optimal transport between unseen actionprototypes and object prototypes. Empirically, we show that universal prototypetransport diminishes the biased selection of unseen action prototypes andboosts both universal action and object models for zero-shot classification andspatio-temporal localization.</description><author>Pascal Mettes</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 10:21:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03971v2</guid></item><item><title>What can a cook in Italy teach a mechanic in India?

Previous studies only utilizethe action labels of verb phrases as the semantic prototypes for learning themapping from skeleton-based actions to a shared semantic space. However, thelimited semantic information of action labels restricts the generalizationability of skeleton features for recognizing unseen actions. In order to solvethis dilemma, we propose a multi-semantic fusion (MSF) model for improving theperformance of GZSSAR, where two kinds of class-level textual descriptions(i.e., action descriptions and motion descriptions), are collected as auxiliarysemantic information to enhance the learning efficacy of generalizable skeletonfeatures. Specially, a pre-trained language encoder takes the actiondescriptions, motion descriptions and original class labels as inputs to obtainrich semantic features for each action class, while a skeleton encoder isimplemented to extract skeleton features. Then, a variational autoencoder (VAE)based generative module is performed to learn a cross-modal alignment betweenskeleton and semantic features. Finally, a classification module is built torecognize the action categories of input samples, where a seen-unseenclassification gate is adopted to predict whether the sample comes from seenaction classes or not in GZSSAR. The superior performance in comparisons withprevious models validates the effectiveness of the proposed MSF model onGZSSAR.</description><author>Ming-Zhe Li, Zhen Jia, Zhang Zhang, Zhanyu Ma, Liang Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 10:00:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09592v1</guid></item><item><title>Video Action Recognition with Attentive Semantic Units</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09756v2</link><description>Visual-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly advanced action videorecognition.

Despite theeffectiveness proved by these works, we believe that the potential of VLMs hasyet to be fully harnessed. In light of this, we exploit the semantic units (SU)hiding behind the action labels and leverage their correlations withfine-grained items in frames for more accurate action recognition. SUs areentities extracted from the language descriptions of the entire action set,including body parts, objects, scenes, and motions. To further enhance thealignments between visual contents and the SUs, we introduce a multi-regionmodule (MRA) to the visual branch of the VLM. The MRA allows the perception ofregion-aware visual features beyond the original global feature. Our methodadaptively attends to and selects relevant SUs with visual features of frames.With a cross-modal decoder, the selected SUs serve to decode spatiotemporalvideo representations. In summary, the SUs as the medium can boostdiscriminative ability and transferability. Specifically, in fully-supervisedlearning, our method achieved 87.8% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400.

The task is challenging due to the high dimensionalitynature of an action, as well as the subtle motion details to be considered.Current state-of-the-art approaches typically learn from articulated motionsequences in the straightforward 3D Euclidean space. However, the vanillaEuclidean space is not efficient for modeling important motion characteristicssuch as the joint-wise angular acceleration, which reveals the driving forcebehind the motion. Moreover, current methods typically attend to each channelequally and lack theoretical constrains on extracting task-relevant featuresfrom the input. In this paper, we seek to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) Wepropose to incorporate an acceleration representation, explicitly modeling thehigher-order variations in motion. (2) We introduce a novel Stream-GCN networkequipped with multi-stream components and channel attention, where differentrepresentations (i.e., streams) supplement each other towards a more preciseaction recognition while attention capitalizes on those important channels.

We representthe action information in each hand interaction region as a triplet, resultingin a total of 878 action triplets. Based on the constructed dataset, webenchmark representative action recognition and detection models on thefollowing three tracks: (1) supervised learning for hand interaction region andobject detection, (2) supervised learning for fine-grained hand actionrecognition, and (3) intra- and inter-class domain generalization for handinteraction region detection. The experimental results offer compellingempirical evidence that highlights the challenges inherent in fine-grained handaction recognition, while also shedding light on potential avenues for futureresearch, particularly in relation to pre-training strategy, model design, anddomain generalization.

Currentmethods primarily aim to either reduce model size or utilize pre-trainedmodels, limiting their adaptability to various backbone architectures. Thispaper investigates the issue of over-sampled frames, a prevalent problem inmany approaches yet it has received relatively little attention. Despite theuse of fewer frames being a potential solution, this approach often results ina substantial decline in performance. To address this issue, we propose a novelmethod to restore the intermediate features for two sparsely sampled andadjacent video frames. This feature restoration technique brings a negligibleincrease in computational requirements compared to resource-intensive imageencoders, such as ViT. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conductextensive experiments on four public datasets, including Kinetics-400,ActivityNet, UCF-101, and HMDB-51. With the integration of our method, theefficiency of three commonly used baselines has been improved by over 50%, witha mere 0.5% reduction in recognition accuracy. In addition, our method alsosurprisingly helps improve the generalization ability of the models underzero-shot settings.</description><author>Harry Cheng, Yangyang Guo, Liqiang Nie, Zhiyong Cheng, Mohan Kankanhalli</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 14:52:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14866v1</guid></item><item><title>Survey of Action Recognition, Spotting and Spatio-Temporal Localization in Soccer -- Current Trends and Research Perspectives</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12067v1</link><description>Action scene understanding in soccer is a challenging task due to the complexand dynamic nature of the game, as well as the interactions between players.This article provides a comprehensive overview of this task divided into actionrecognition, spotting, and spatio-temporal action localization, with aparticular emphasis on the modalities used and multimodal methods.

Most of the existing works are based onskeleton data while using a multi-modality setup. These works overlooked thedifferences in performance among modalities, which led to the propagation oferroneous knowledge between modalities while only three fundamental modalities,i.e., joints, bones, and motions are used, hence no additional modalities areexplored. In this work, we first propose an Implicit Knowledge Exchange Module (IKEM)which alleviates the propagation of erroneous knowledge between low-performancemodalities. Then, we further propose three new modalities to enrich thecomplementary information between modalities. Finally, to maintain efficiencywhen introducing new modalities, we propose a novel teacher-student frameworkto distill the knowledge from the secondary modalities into the mandatorymodalities considering the relationship constrained by anchors, positives, andnegatives, named relational cross-modality knowledge distillation. Theexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, unlockingthe efficient use of skeleton-based multi-modality data.

It hasbeen observed that the semantic distinction of human action features is oftenrepresented by local body parts, such as legs or hands, which are advantageousfor skeleton-based action recognition. This paper proposes an attention-basedcontrastive learning framework for skeleton representation learning, calledSkeAttnCLR, which integrates local similarity and global features forskeleton-based action representations. To achieve this, a multi-head attentionmask module is employed to learn the soft attention mask features from theskeletons, suppressing non-salient local features while accentuating localsalient features, thereby bringing similar local features closer in the featurespace. Additionally, ample contrastive pairs are generated by expandingcontrastive pairs based on salient and non-salient features with globalfeatures, which guide the network to learn the semantic representations of theentire skeleton. Therefore, with the attention mask mechanism, SkeAttnCLRlearns local features under different data augmentation views. The experimentresults demonstrate that the inclusion of local feature similaritysignificantly enhances skeleton-based action representation. Our proposedSkeAttnCLR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NTURGB+D, NTU120-RGB+D, andPKU-MMD datasets.</description><author>Yilei Hua, Wenhan Wu, Ce Zheng, Aidong Lu, Mengyuan Liu, Chen Chen, Shiqian Wu</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 08:26:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00666v2</guid></item><item><title>MAtch, eXpand and Improve: Unsupervised Finetuning for Zero-Shot Action Recognition with Language Knowledge</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08914v2</link><description>Large scale Vision-Language (VL) models have shown tremendous success inaligning representations between visual and text modalities. This enablesremarkable progress in zero-shot recognition, image generation &amp; editing, andmany other exciting tasks. However, VL models tend to over-represent objectswhile paying much less attention to verbs, and require additional tuning onvideo data for best zero-shot action recognition performance. While previouswork relied on large-scale, fully-annotated data, in this work we propose anunsupervised approach. We adapt a VL model for zero-shot and few-shot actionrecognition using a collection of unlabeled videos and an unpaired actiondictionary. Based on that, we leverage Large Language Models and VL models tobuild a text bag for each unlabeled video via matching, text expansion andcaptioning. We use those bags in a Multiple Instance Learning setup to adapt animage-text backbone to video data. Although finetuned on unlabeled video data,our resulting models demonstrate high transferability to numerous unseenzero-shot downstream tasks, improving the base VL model performance by up to14\%, and even comparing favorably to fully-supervised baselines in bothzero-shot and few-shot video recognition transfer.

However, mostcurrent few-shot action recognition methods are still limited to a singlevisual modality input due to the high cost of annotating additional textualdescriptions. In this paper, we develop an effective plug-and-play frameworkcalled CapFSAR to exploit the knowledge of multimodal models without manuallyannotating text. To be specific, we first utilize a captioning foundation model(i.e., BLIP) to extract visual features and automatically generate associatedcaptions for input videos. Then, we apply a text encoder to the syntheticcaptions to obtain representative text embeddings. Finally, a visual-textaggregation module based on Transformer is further designed to incorporatecross-modal spatio-temporal complementary information for reliable few-shotmatching. In this way, CapFSAR can benefit from powerful multimodal knowledgeof pretrained foundation models, yielding more comprehensive classification inthe low-shot regime.

Inrecent years, many approaches for few-shot action recognition have followed themetric-based methods, especially, since some works use the Transformer to getthe cross-attention feature of the videos or the enhanced prototype, and theresults are competitive. However, they do not mine enough information from theTransformer because they only focus on the feature of a single level. In ourpaper, we have addressed this problem. We propose an end-to-end method named"Task-Specific Alignment and Multiple Level Transformer Network (TSA-MLT)". Inour model, the Multiple Level Transformer focuses on the multiple-level featureof the support video and query video. Especially before Multiple LevelTransformer, we use task-specific TSA to filter unimportant or misleadingframes as a pre-processing. Furthermore, we adopt a fusion loss using two kindsof distance, the first is L2 sequence distance, which focuses on temporal orderalignment. The second one is Optimal transport distance, which focuses onmeasuring the gap between the appearance and semantics of the videos. Using asimple fusion network, we fuse the two distances element-wise, then use thecross-entropy loss as our fusion loss.

The factorised encodervariant follows the late-fusion approach that is adopted by many state of theart approaches. Despite standing out for its favorable speed/accuracy tradeoffsamong the different variants of ViViT, its considerable training time andmemory requirements still pose a significant barrier to entry. Our method isdesigned to lower this barrier and is based on the idea of freezing the spatialtransformer during training. This leads to a low accuracy model if naivelydone. But we show that by (1) appropriately initializing the temporaltransformer (a module responsible for processing temporal information) (2)introducing a compact adapter model connecting frozen spatial representations((a module that selectively focuses on regions of the input image) to thetemporal transformer, we can enjoy the benefits of freezing the spatialtransformer without sacrificing accuracy.

Meanwhile, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significantattention due to their remarkable efficiency and fault tolerance. Bysynergistically harnessing the energy efficiency inherent in event cameras andthe spike-based processing capabilities of SNNs, their integration could enableultra-low-power application scenarios, such as action recognition tasks.However, existing approaches often entail converting asynchronous events intoconventional frames, leading to additional data mapping efforts and a loss ofsparsity, contradicting the design concept of SNNs and event cameras. Toaddress this challenge, we propose SpikePoint, a novel end-to-end point-basedSNN architecture. SpikePoint excels at processing sparse event cloud data,effectively extracting both global and local features through a singular-stagestructure. Leveraging the surrogate training method, SpikePoint achieves highaccuracy with few parameters and maintains low power consumption, specificallyemploying the identity mapping feature extractor on diverse datasets.SpikePoint achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four event-basedaction recognition datasets using only 16 timesteps, surpassing other SNNmethods. Moreover, it also achieves SOTA performance across all methods onthree datasets, utilizing approximately 0.3\% of the parameters and 0.5\% ofpower consumption employed by artificial neural networks (ANNs). These resultsemphasize the significance of Point Cloud and pave the way for manyultra-low-power event-based data processing applications.</description><author>Hongwei Ren, Yue Zhou, Yulong Huang, Haotian Fu, Xiaopeng Lin, Jie Song, Bojun Cheng</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 05:38:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07189v1</guid></item><item><title>Multimodal Distillation for Egocentric Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07483v2</link><description>The focal point of egocentric video understanding is modelling hand-objectinteractions. Standard models, e.g. CNNs or Vision Transformers, which receiveRGB frames as input perform well. However, their performance improves furtherby employing additional input modalities that provide complementary cues, suchas object detections, optical flow, audio, etc. The added complexity of themodality-specific modules, on the other hand, makes these models impracticalfor deployment. The goal of this work is to retain the performance of such amultimodal approach, while using only the RGB frames as input at inferencetime. We demonstrate that for egocentric action recognition on theEpic-Kitchens and the Something-Something datasets, students which are taughtby multimodal teachers tend to be more accurate and better calibrated thanarchitecturally equivalent models trained on ground truth labels in a unimodalor multimodal fashion. We further adopt a principled multimodal knowledgedistillation framework, allowing us to deal with issues which occur whenapplying multimodal knowledge distillation in a naive manner. Lastly, wedemonstrate the achieved reduction in computational complexity, and show thatour approach maintains higher performance with the reduction of the number ofinput views.

In this work,we aim at identifying crossing pedestrians and predicting their futuretrajectories. To achieve these goals, we not only need the context informationof road geometry and other traffic participants but also need fine-grainedinformation of the human pose, motion and activity, which can be inferred fromhuman keypoints. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learningframework for pedestrian crossing action recognition and trajectory prediction,which utilizes 3D human keypoints extracted from raw sensor data to capturerich information on human pose and activity. Moreover, we propose to apply twoauxiliary tasks and contrastive learning to enable auxiliary supervisions toimprove the learned keypoints representation, which further enhances theperformance of major tasks. We validate our approach on a large-scale in-housedataset, as well as a public benchmark dataset, and show that our approachachieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of evaluation metrics.The effectiveness of each model component is validated in a detailed ablationstudy.</description><author>Jiachen Li, Xinwei Shi, Feiyu Chen, Jonathan Stroud, Zhishuai Zhang, Tian Lan, Junhua Mao, Jeonhyung Kang, Khaled S.

In order to provide answers, in this work we demonstrate howSpiking neurons can enable temporal feature extraction in feed-forward neuralnetworks without the need for recurrent synapses, showing how theirbio-inspired computing principles can be successfully exploited beyond energyefficiency gains and evidencing their differences with respect to conventionalneurons. This is demonstrated by proposing a new task, DVS-Gesture-Chain(DVS-GC), which allows, for the first time, to evaluate the perception oftemporal dependencies in a real event-based action recognition dataset. Ourstudy proves how the widely used DVS Gesture benchmark could be solved bynetworks without temporal feature extraction, unlike the new DVS-GC whichdemands an understanding of the ordering of the events. Furthermore, this setupallowed us to unveil the role of the leakage rate in spiking neurons fortemporal processing tasks and demonstrated the benefits of "hard reset"mechanisms. Additionally, we also show how time-dependent weights andnormalization can lead to understanding order by means of temporal attention.</description><author>Alex Vicente-Sola, Davide L.

To addressthe slow inference speed caused by overly complex model structures, weintroduce re-parameterization and over-parameterization techniques to GCNs, andpropose two novel high-performance inference graph convolutional networks,namely HPI-GCN-RP and HPI-GCN-OP. HPI-GCN-RP uses re-parameterization techniqueto GCNs to achieve a higher inference speed with competitive model performance.HPI-GCN-OP further utilizes over-parameterization technique to bringsignificant performance improvement with inference speed slightly decreased.Experimental results on the two skeleton-based action recognition datasetsdemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our HPI-GCN-OP achieves anaccuracy of 93% on the cross-subject split of the NTU-RGB+D 60 dataset, and90.1% on the cross-subject benchmark of the NTU-RGB+D 120 dataset and is 4.5times faster than HD-GCN at the same accuracy.</description><author>Ziao Li, Junyi Wang, Guhong Nie</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 04:30:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18710v1</guid></item><item><title>High-order Tensor Pooling with Attention for Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05216v3</link><description>We aim at capturing high-order statistics of feature vectors formed by aneural network, and propose end-to-end second- and higher-order pooling to forma tensor descriptor.

However, these modelsexhibit a key limitation: they necessitate complete action observation prior toclassification, which constrains their applicability in real-time situationssuch as surveillance and robotic systems. To overcome this barrier, weintroduce InfoGCN++, an innovative extension of InfoGCN, explicitly developedfor online skeleton-based action recognition. InfoGCN++ augments the abilitiesof the original InfoGCN model by allowing real-time categorization of actiontypes, independent of the observation sequence's length. It transcendsconventional approaches by learning from current and anticipated futuremovements, thereby creating a more thorough representation of the entiresequence. Our approach to prediction is managed as an extrapolation issue,grounded on observed actions. To enable this, InfoGCN++ incorporates NeuralOrdinary Differential Equations, a concept that lets it effectively model thecontinuous evolution of hidden states. Following rigorous evaluations on threeskeleton-based action recognition benchmarks, InfoGCN++ demonstratesexceptional performance in online action recognition. It consistently equals orexceeds existing techniques, highlighting its significant potential to reshapethe landscape of real-time action recognition applications. Consequently, thiswork represents a major leap forward from InfoGCN, pushing the limits of what'spossible in online, skeleton-based action recognition. The code for InfoGCN++is publicly available at https://github.com/stnoah1/infogcn2 for furtherexploration and validation.</description><author>Seunggeun Chi, Hyung-gun Chi, Qixing Huang, Karthik Ramani</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 17:15:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10547v1</guid></item><item><title>Action Recognition in Video Recordings from Gynecologic Laparoscopy</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18666v1</link><description>Action recognition is a prerequisite for many applications in laparoscopicvideo analysis including but not limited to surgical training, operation roomplanning, follow-up surgery preparation, post-operative surgical assessment,and surgical outcome estimation. However, automatic action recognition inlaparoscopic surgeries involves numerous challenges such as (I) cross-actionand intra-action duration variation, (II) relevant content distortion due tosmoke, blood accumulation, fast camera motions, organ movements, objectocclusion, and (III) surgical scene variations due to different illuminationsand viewpoints. Besides, action annotations in laparoscopy surgeries arelimited and expensive due to requiring expert knowledge. In this study, wedesign and evaluate a CNN-RNN architecture as well as a customizedtraining-inference framework to deal with the mentioned challenges inlaparoscopic surgery action recognition. Using stacked recurrent layers, ourproposed network takes advantage of inter-frame dependencies to negate thenegative effect of content distortion and variation in action recognition.Furthermore, our proposed frame sampling strategy effectively manages theduration variations in surgical actions to enable action recognition with hightemporal resolution. Our extensive experiments confirm the superiority of ourproposed method in action recognition compared to static CNNs.</description><author>Sahar Nasirihaghighi, Negin Ghamsarian, Daniela Stefanics, Klaus Schoeffmann, Heinrich Husslein</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2023 16:15:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18666v1</guid></item><item><title>Balanced Representation Learning for Long-tailed Skeleton-based Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14024v1</link><description>Skeleton-based action recognition has recently made significant progress.However, data imbalance is still a great challenge in real-world scenarios. Theperformance of current action recognition algorithms declines sharply whentraining data suffers from heavy class imbalance. The imbalanced data actuallydegrades the representations learned by these methods and becomes thebottleneck for action recognition. How to learn unbiased representations fromimbalanced action data is the key to long-tailed action recognition. In thispaper, we propose a novel balanced representation learning method to addressthe long-tailed problem in action recognition. Firstly, a spatial-temporalaction exploration strategy is presented to expand the sample spaceeffectively, generating more valuable samples in a rebalanced manner. Secondly,we design a detached action-aware learning schedule to further mitigate thebias in the representation space. The schedule detaches the representationlearning of tail classes from training and proposes an action-aware loss toimpose more effective constraints. Additionally, a skip-modal representation isproposed to provide complementary structural information. The proposed methodis validated on four skeleton datasets, NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA,and Kinetics. It not only achieves consistently large improvement compared tothe state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also demonstrates a superiorgeneralization capacity through extensive experiments.

However, most of thecurrent few-shot action recognition methods still rely on 2D frame-levelrepresentations, often require additional components to model temporalrelations, and employ complex distance functions to achieve accurate alignmentof these representations. In addition, existing methods struggle to effectivelyintegrate textual semantics, some resorting to concatenation or addition oftextual and visual features, and some using text merely as an additionalsupervision without truly achieving feature fusion and information transferfrom different modalities. In this work, we propose a simple yet effectiveSemantic-Aware Few-Shot Action Recognition (SAFSAR) model to address theseissues. We show that directly leveraging a 3D feature extractor combined withan effective feature-fusion scheme, and a simple cosine similarity forclassification can yield better performance without the need of extracomponents for temporal modeling or complex distance functions. We introduce aninnovative scheme to encode the textual semantics into the video representationwhich adaptively fuses features from text and video, and encourages the visualencoder to extract more semantically consistent features. In this scheme,SAFSAR achieves alignment and fusion in a compact way. Experiments on fivechallenging few-shot action recognition benchmarks under various settingsdemonstrate that the proposed SAFSAR model significantly improves thestate-of-the-art performance.</description><author>Yutao Tang, Benjamin Bejar, Rene Vidal</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 18:13:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06218v1</guid></item><item><title>Temporal Shuffling for Defending Deep Action Recognition Models against Adversarial Attacks</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07921v2</link><description>Recently, video-based action recognition methods using convolutional neuralnetworks (CNNs) achieve remarkable recognition performance. However, there isstill lack of understanding about the generalization mechanism of actionrecognition models. In this paper, we suggest that action recognition modelsrely on the motion information less than expected, and thus they are robust torandomization of frame orders. Furthermore, we find that motion monotonicityremaining after randomization also contributes to such robustness. Based onthis observation, we develop a novel defense method using temporal shuffling ofinput videos against adversarial attacks for action recognition models. Anotherobservation enabling our defense method is that adversarial perturbations onvideos are sensitive to temporal destruction. To the best of our knowledge,this is the first attempt to design a defense method without additionaltraining for 3D CNN-based video action recognition models.</description><author>Jaehui Hwang, Huan Zhang, Jun-Ho Choi, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Jong-Seok Lee</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 09:59:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07921v2</guid></item><item><title>Challenges in Video-Based Infant Action Recognition: A Critical Examination of the State of the Art</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12300v1</link><description>Automated human action recognition, a burgeoning field within computervision, boasts diverse applications spanning surveillance, security,human-computer interaction, tele-health, and sports analysis. Precise actionrecognition in infants serves a multitude of pivotal purposes, encompassingsafety monitoring, developmental milestone tracking, early intervention fordevelopmental delays, fostering parent-infant bonds, advancing computer-aideddiagnostics, and contributing to the scientific comprehension of childdevelopment. This paper delves into the intricacies of infant actionrecognition, a domain that has remained relatively uncharted despite theaccomplishments in adult action recognition. In this study, we introduce agroundbreaking dataset called ``InfActPrimitive'', encompassing fivesignificant infant milestone action categories, and we incorporate specializedpreprocessing for infant data. We conducted an extensive comparative analysisemploying cutting-edge skeleton-based action recognition models using thisdataset. Our findings reveal that, although the PoseC3D model achieves thehighest accuracy at approximately 71%, the remaining models struggle toaccurately capture the dynamics of infant actions. This highlights asubstantial knowledge gap between infant and adult action recognition domainsand the urgent need for data-efficient pipeline models.</description><author>Elaheh Hatamimajoumerd, Pooria Daneshvar Kakhaki, Xiaofei Huang, Lingfei Luan, Somaieh Amraee, Sarah Ostadabbas</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2023 02:36:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12300v1</guid></item><item><title>Few-shot Action Recognition via Intra- and Inter-Video Information Maximization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06114v1</link><description>Current few-shot action recognition involves two primary sources ofinformation for classification:(1) intra-video information, determined by framecontent within a single video clip, and (2) inter-video information, measuredby relationships (e.g., feature similarity) among videos. However, existingmethods inadequately exploit these two information sources. In terms ofintra-video information, current sampling operations for input videos may omitcritical action information, reducing the utilization efficiency of video data.For the inter-video information, the action misalignment among videos makes itchallenging to calculate precise relationships. Moreover, how to jointlyconsider both inter- and intra-video information remains under-explored forfew-shot action recognition. To this end, we propose a novel framework, VideoInformation Maximization (VIM), for few-shot video action recognition. VIM isequipped with an adaptive spatial-temporal video sampler and a spatiotemporalaction alignment model to maximize intra- and inter-video information,respectively. The video sampler adaptively selects important frames andamplifies critical spatial regions for each input video based on the task athand. This preserves and emphasizes informative parts of video clips whileeliminating interference at the data level. The alignment model performstemporal and spatial action alignment sequentially at the feature level,leading to more precise measurements of inter-video similarity. Finally, Thesegoals are facilitated by incorporating additional loss terms based on mutualinformation measurement. Consequently, VIM acts to maximize the distinctivenessof video information from limited video data. Extensive experimental results onpublic datasets for few-shot action recognition demonstrate the effectivenessand benefits of our framework.</description><author>Huabin Liu, Weiyao Lin, Tieyuan Chen, Yuxi Li, Shuyuan Li, John See</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 14:05:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06114v1</guid></item><item><title>Hierarchical Compositional Representations for Few-shot Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09424v2</link><description>Recently action recognition has received more and more attention for itscomprehensive and practical applications in intelligent surveillance andhuman-computer interaction. However, few-shot action recognition has not beenwell explored and remains challenging because of data scarcity. In this paper,we propose a novel hierarchical compositional representations (HCR) learningapproach for few-shot action recognition. Specifically, we divide a complicatedaction into several sub-actions by carefully designed hierarchical clusteringand further decompose the sub-actions into more fine-grained spatiallyattentional sub-actions (SAS-actions). Although there exist large differencesbetween base classes and novel classes, they can share similar patterns insub-actions or SAS-actions. Furthermore, we adopt the Earth Mover's Distance inthe transportation problem to measure the similarity between video samples interms of sub-action representations. It computes the optimal matching flowsbetween sub-actions as distance metric, which is favorable for comparingfine-grained patterns.

We represent skeleton data atmultiple spatial and temporal scales and achieve optimal feature matching fromtwo perspectives. The first is multi-scale matching which captures thescale-wise semantic relevance of skeleton data at multiple spatial and temporalscales simultaneously.

However, this would cause negativetransfer during domain adaptation due to some negative training samples in bothdomains. In the source domain, some training samples are of low-relevance totarget domain due to the difference in viewpoints, action styles, etc. In thetarget domain, there are some ambiguous training samples that can be easilyclassified as another type of action under the case of source domain. Theproblem of negative transfer has been explored in cross-domain objectdetection, while it remains under-explored in cross-domain action recognition.Therefore, we propose a Multi-modal Instance Refinement (MMIR) method toalleviate the negative transfer based on reinforcement learning. Specifically,a reinforcement learning agent is trained in both domains for every modality torefine the training data by selecting out negative samples from each domain.Our method finally outperforms several other state-of-the-art baselines incross-domain action recognition on the benchmark EPIC-Kitchens dataset, whichdemonstrates the advantage of MMIR in reducing negative transfer.</description><author>Yuan Qing, Naixing Wu, Shaohua Wan, Lixin Duan</author><pubDate>Fri, 24 Nov 2023 05:06:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14281v1</guid></item><item><title>Egocentric RGB+Depth Action Recognition in Industry-Like Settings</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13962v1</link><description>Action recognition from an egocentric viewpoint is a crucial perception taskin robotics and enables a wide range of human-robot interactions.

In this study, we propose a new 3D deformable transformer for actionrecognition with adaptive spatiotemporal receptive fields and a cross-modallearning scheme. The 3D deformable transformer consists of three attentionmodules: 3D deformability, local joint stride, and temporal stride attention.The two cross-modal tokens are input into the 3D deformable attention module tocreate a cross-attention token with a reflected spatiotemporal correlation.Local joint stride attention is applied to spatially combine attention and posetokens. Temporal stride attention temporally reduces the number of input tokensin the attention module and supports temporal expression learning without thesimultaneous use of all tokens. The deformable transformer iterates L-times andcombines the last cross-modal token for classification. The proposed 3Ddeformable transformer was tested on the NTU60, NTU120, FineGYM, and PennActiondatasets, and showed results better than or similar to pre-trainedstate-of-the-art methods even without a pre-training process.

Humans can abstract awaythe action from the appearance of the objects and their context which isreferred to as compositionality of actions. Compositional action recognitiondeals with imparting human-like compositional generalization abilities toaction-recognition models. In this regard, extracting the interactions betweenhumans and objects forms the basis of compositional understanding. Theseinteractions are not affected by the appearance biases of the objects or thecontext. But the context provides additional cues about the interactionsbetween things and stuff. Hence we need to infuse context into the human-objectinteractions for compositional action recognition. To this end, we first designa spatial-temporal interaction encoder that captures the human-object (things)interactions. The encoder learns the spatio-temporal interaction tokensdisentangled from the background context. The interaction tokens are theninfused with contextual information from the video tokens to model theinteractions between things and stuff. The final context-infusedspatio-temporal interaction tokens are used for compositional actionrecognition. We show the effectiveness of our interaction-centric approach onthe compositional Something-Else dataset where we obtain a new state-of-the-artresult of 83.8% top-1 accuracy outperforming recent important object-centricmethods by a significant margin.

Despite the progress madein FS coarse-grained action recognition, current approaches encounter twochallenges when dealing with the fine-grained action categories: the inabilityto capture subtle action details and the insufficiency of learning from limiteddata that exhibit high intra-class variance and inter-class similarity. Toaddress these limitations, we propose M$^3$Net, a matching-based framework forFS-FG action recognition, which incorporates \textit{multi-view encoding},\textit{multi-view matching}, and \textit{multi-view fusion} to facilitateembedding encoding, similarity matching, and decision making across multipleviewpoints. \textit{Multi-view encoding} captures rich contextual details fromthe intra-frame, intra-video, and intra-episode perspectives, generatingcustomized higher-order embeddings for fine-grained data. \textit{Multi-viewmatching} integrates various matching functions enabling flexible relationmodeling within limited samples to handle multi-scale spatio-temporalvariations by leveraging the instance-specific, category-specific, andtask-specific perspectives. \textit{Multi-view fusion} consists ofmatching-predictions fusion and matching-losses fusion over the above views,where the former promotes mutual complementarity and the latter enhancesembedding generalizability by employing multi-task collaborative learning.Explainable visualizations and experimental results on three challengingbenchmarks demonstrate the superiority of M$^3$Net in capturing fine-grainedaction details and achieving state-of-the-art performance for FS-FG actionrecognition.</description><author>Hao Tang, Jun Liu, Shuanglin Yan, Rui Yan, Zechao Li, Jinhui Tang</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 10:15:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03063v1</guid></item><item><title>On the Importance of Spatial Relations for Few-shot Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07119v1</link><description>Deep learning has achieved great success in video recognition, yet stillstruggles to recognize novel actions when faced with only a few examples. Totackle this challenge, few-shot action recognition methods have been proposedto transfer knowledge from a source dataset to a novel target dataset with onlyone or a few labeled videos. However, existing methods mainly focus on modelingthe temporal relations between the query and support videos while ignoring thespatial relations. In this paper, we find that the spatial misalignment betweenobjects also occurs in videos, notably more common than the temporalinconsistency. We are thus motivated to investigate the importance of spatialrelations and propose a more accurate few-shot action recognition method thatleverages both spatial and temporal information. Particularly, a novel SpatialAlignment Cross Transformer (SA-CT) which learns to re-adjust the spatialrelations and incorporates the temporal information is contributed. Experimentsreveal that, even without using any temporal information, the performance ofSA-CT is comparable to temporal based methods on 3/4 benchmarks. To furtherincorporate the temporal information, we propose a simple yet effectiveTemporal Mixer module. The Temporal Mixer enhances the video representation andimproves the performance of the full SA-CT model, achieving very competitiveresults. In this work, we also exploit large-scale pretrained models forfew-shot action recognition, providing useful insights for this researchdirection.</description><author>Yilun Zhang, Yuqian Fu, Xingjun Ma, Lizhe Qi, Jingjing Chen, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2023 13:58:02 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07119v1</guid></item><item><title>Distilling Knowledge from CNN-Transformer Models for Enhanced Human Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01283v1</link><description>This paper presents a study on improving human action recognition through theutilization of knowledge distillation, and the combination of CNN and ViTmodels.

The advent of deep learning hassignificantly improved the accuracy of pose capture, making pose-basedapplications increasingly practical. This paper presents a comprehensive surveyof pose-based applications utilizing deep learning, encompassing poseestimation, pose tracking, and action recognition.Pose estimation involves thedetermination of human joint positions from images or image sequences. Posetracking is an emerging research direction aimed at generating consistent humanpose trajectories over time. Action recognition, on the other hand, targets theidentification of action types using pose estimation or tracking data. Thesethree tasks are intricately interconnected, with the latter often reliant onthe former. In this survey, we comprehensively review related works, spanningfrom single-person pose estimation to multi-person pose estimation, from 2Dpose estimation to 3D pose estimation, from single image to video, from miningtemporal context gradually to pose tracking, and lastly from tracking topose-based action recognition. As a survey centered on the application of deeplearning to pose analysis, we explicitly discuss both the strengths andlimitations of existing techniques. Notably, we emphasize methodologies forintegrating these three tasks into a unified framework within video sequences.Additionally, we explore the challenges involved and outline potentialdirections for future research.</description><author>Lijuan Zhou, Xiang Meng, Zhihuan Liu, Mengqi Wu, Zhimin Gao, Pichao Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 18:59:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13039v1</guid></item><item><title>Position and Orientation-Aware One-Shot Learning for Medical Action Recognition from Signal Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15635v1</link><description>In this work, we propose a position and orientation-aware one-shot learningframework for medical action recognition from signal data.

However, mostlarge-scale video datasets contain images of people and hence are accompaniedwith issues related to privacy, ethics, and data protection, often preventingthem from being publicly shared for reproducible research. Existing work hasattempted to alleviate these problems by blurring faces, downsampling videos,or training on synthetic data. On the other hand, analysis on thetransferability of privacy-preserving pre-trained models to downstream taskshas been limited. In this work, we study this problem by first asking thequestion: can we pre-train models for human action recognition with data thatdoes not include real humans? To this end, we present, for the first time, abenchmark that leverages real-world videos with humans removed and syntheticdata containing virtual humans to pre-train a model. We then evaluate thetransferability of the representation learned on this data to a diverse set ofdownstream action recognition benchmarks. Furthermore, we propose a novelpre-training strategy, called Privacy-Preserving MAE-Align, to effectivelycombine synthetic data and human-removed real data. Our approach outperformsprevious baselines by up to 5% and closes the performance gap between human andno-human action recognition representations on downstream tasks, for bothlinear probing and fine-tuning.

Many recentmethods have achieved remarkable performance using graph convolutional networks(GCNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which extract spatial andtemporal features, respectively. Although spatial and temporal dependencies inthe human skeleton have been explored separately, spatio-temporal dependency israrely considered. In this paper, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Curve Network(STC-Net) to effectively leverage the spatio-temporal dependency of the humanskeleton. Our proposed network consists of two novel elements: 1) TheSpatio-Temporal Curve (STC) module; and 2) Dilated Kernels for GraphConvolution (DK-GC). The STC module dynamically adjusts the receptive field byidentifying meaningful node connections between every adjacent frame andgenerating spatio-temporal curves based on the identified node connections,providing an adaptive spatio-temporal coverage. In addition, we propose DK-GCto consider long-range dependencies, which results in a large receptive fieldwithout any additional parameters by applying an extended kernel to the givenadjacency matrices of the graph. Our STC-Net combines these two modules andachieves state-of-the-art performance on four skeleton-based action recognitionbenchmarks.</description><author>Jungho Lee, Minhyeok Lee, Suhwan Cho, Sungmin Woo, Sungjun Jang, Sangyoun Lee</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 03:20:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04761v2</guid></item><item><title>Baby Physical Safety Monitoring in Smart Home Using Action Recognition System</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12527v2</link><description>Humans are able to intuitively deduce actions that took place between twostates in observations via deductive reasoning. This is because the brainoperates on a bidirectional communication model, which has radically improvedthe accuracy of recognition and prediction based on features connected toprevious experiences. During the past decade, deep learning models for actionrecognition have significantly improved. However, deep neural networks strugglewith these tasks on a smaller dataset for specific Action Recognition (AR)tasks. As with most action recognition tasks, the ambiguity of accuratelydescribing activities in spatial-temporal data is a drawback that can beovercome by curating suitable datasets, including careful annotations andpreprocessing of video data for analyzing various recognition tasks. In thisstudy, we present a novel lightweight framework combining transfer learningtechniques with a Conv2D LSTM layer to extract features from the pre-trainedI3D model on the Kinetics dataset for a new AR task (Smart Baby Care) thatrequires a smaller dataset and less computational resources. Furthermore, wedeveloped a benchmark dataset and an automated model that uses LSTM convolutionwith I3D (ConvLSTM-I3D) for recognizing and predicting baby activities in asmart baby room. Finally, we implemented video augmentation to improve modelperformance on the smart baby care task.

The key is tobuild the connection between visual and semantic space from seen to unseenclasses. Previous studies have primarily focused on encoding sequences into asingular feature vector, with subsequent mapping the features to an identicalanchor point within the embedded space. Their performance is hindered by 1) theignorance of the global visual/semantic distribution alignment, which resultsin a limitation to capture the true interdependence between the two spaces. 2)the negligence of temporal information since the frame-wise features with richaction clues are directly pooled into a single feature vector. We propose a newzero-shot skeleton-based action recognition method via mutual information (MI)estimation and maximization. Specifically, 1) we maximize the MI between visualand semantic space for distribution alignment; 2) we leverage the temporalinformation for estimating the MI by encouraging MI to increase as more framesare observed.

This requiresactor-specific pose estimation (e.g., humans vs. animals), leading tocumbersome model design complexity and high maintenance costs. Moreover, theyoften focus on learning the visual modality alone and single-labelclassification whilst neglecting other available information sources (e.g.,class name text) and the concurrent occurrence of multiple actions. To overcomethese limitations, we propose a new approach called 'actor-agnostic multi-modalmulti-label action recognition,' which offers a unified solution for varioustypes of actors, including humans and animals. We further formulate a novelMulti-modal Semantic Query Network (MSQNet) model in a transformer-based objectdetection framework (e.g., DETR), characterized by leveraging visual andtextual modalities to represent the action classes better. The elimination ofactor-specific model designs is a key advantage, as it removes the need foractor pose estimation altogether. Extensive experiments on five publiclyavailable benchmarks show that our MSQNet consistently outperforms the priorarts of actor-specific alternatives on human and animal single- and multi-labelaction recognition tasks by up to 50%.

In this paper, we propose a graph contrastive learningframework for skeleton-based action recognition (\textit{SkeletonGCL}) toexplore the \textit{global} context across all sequences. In specific,SkeletonGCL associates graph learning across sequences by enforcing graphs tobe class-discriminative, \emph{i.e.,} intra-class compact and inter-classdispersed, which improves the GCN capacity to distinguish various actionpatterns. Besides, two memory banks are designed to enrich cross-sequencecontext from two complementary levels, \emph{i.e.,} instance and semanticlevels, enabling graph contrastive learning in multiple context scales.Consequently, SkeletonGCL establishes a new training paradigm, and it can beseamlessly incorporated into current GCNs.

Thisissue can severely degrade the open-set action recognition performance when thetesting samples have different scene distributions from the training samples.To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel method, called Scene-debiasingOpen-set Action Recognition (SOAR), which features an adversarial scenereconstruction module and an adaptive adversarial scene classification module.The former prevents the decoder from reconstructing the video background givenvideo features, and thus helps reduce the background information in featurelearning. The latter aims to confuse scene type classification given videofeatures, with a specific emphasis on the action foreground, and helps to learnscene-invariant information. In addition, we design an experiment to quantifythe scene bias. The results indicate that the current open-set actionrecognizers are biased toward the scene, and our proposed SOAR method bettermitigates such bias. Furthermore, our extensive experiments demonstrate thatour method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and the ablation studiesconfirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules.</description><author>Yuanhao Zhai, Ziyi Liu, Zhenyu Wu, Yi Wu, Chunluan Zhou, David Doermann, Junsong Yuan, Gang Hua</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2023 21:20:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01265v1</guid></item><item><title>FSAR: Federated Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Adaptive Topology Structure and Knowledge Distillation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11046v1</link><description>Existing skeleton-based action recognition methods typically follow acentralized learning paradigm, which can pose privacy concerns when exposinghuman-related videos. Federated Learning (FL) has attracted much attention dueto its outstanding advantages in privacy-preserving. However, directly applyingFL approaches to skeleton videos suffers from unstable training. In this paper,we investigate and discover that the heterogeneous human topology graphstructure is the crucial factor hindering training stability. To address thislimitation, we pioneer a novel Federated Skeleton-based Action Recognition(FSAR) paradigm, which enables the construction of a globally generalized modelwithout accessing local sensitive data. Specifically, we introduce an AdaptiveTopology Structure (ATS), separating generalization and personalization bylearning a domain-invariant topology shared across clients and adomain-specific topology decoupled from global model aggregation.Furthermore,we explore Multi-grain Knowledge Distillation (MKD) to mitigate the discrepancybetween clients and server caused by distinct updating patterns throughaligning shallow block-wise motion features. Extensive experiments on multipledatasets demonstrate that FSAR outperforms state-of-the-art FL-based methodswhile inherently protecting privacy.</description><author>Jingwen Guo, Hong Liu, Shitong Sun, Tianyu Guo, Min Zhang, Chenyang Si</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2023 17:18:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11046v1</guid></item><item><title>SCD-Net: Spatiotemporal Clues Disentanglement Network for Self-supervised Skeleton-based Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05834v1</link><description>Contrastive learning has achieved great success in skeleton-based actionrecognition. However, most existing approaches encode the skeleton sequences asentangled spatiotemporal representations and confine the contrasts to the samelevel of representation.

Specifically, we integrate the decoupling module with a featureextractor to derive explicit clues from spatial and temporal domainsrespectively. As for the training of SCD-Net, with a constructed global anchor,we encourage the interaction between the anchor and extracted clues. Further,we propose a new masking strategy with structural constraints to strengthen thecontextual associations, leveraging the latest development from masked imagemodelling into the proposed SCD-Net.

However, 3D human actionrecognition is a challenging task due to the irregularity and Disarrangement ofthe data points in action sequences. In this context, we present our novelmodel for human action recognition from fixed topology mesh sequences based onSpiral Auto-encoder and Transformer Network, namely SpATr. The proposed methodfirst disentangles space and time in the mesh sequences. Then, an auto-encoderis utilized to extract spatial geometrical features, and tiny transformer isused to capture the temporal evolution of the sequence. Previous methods eitheruse 2D depth images, sample skeletons points or they require a huge amount ofmemory leading to the ability to process short sequences only. In this work, weshow competitive recognition rate and high memory efficiency by building ourauto-encoder based on spiral convolutions, which are light weight convolutiondirectly applied to mesh data with fixed topologies, and by modeling temporalevolution using a attention, that can handle large sequences. The proposedmethod is evaluated on on two 3D human action datasets: MoVi and BMLrub fromthe Archive of Motion Capture As Surface Shapes (AMASS).

Most contrastive learning methods utilizecarefully designed augmentations to generate different movement patterns ofskeletons for the same semantics. However, it is still a pending issue to applystrong augmentations, which distort the images/skeletons' structures and causesemantic loss, due to their resulting unstable training. In this paper, weinvestigate the potential of adopting strong augmentations and propose ageneral hierarchical consistent contrastive learning framework (HiCLR) forskeleton-based action recognition. Specifically, we first design a gradualgrowing augmentation policy to generate multiple ordered positive pairs, whichguide to achieve the consistency of the learned representation from differentviews. Then, an asymmetric loss is proposed to enforce the hierarchicalconsistency via a directional clustering operation in the feature space,pulling the representations from strongly augmented views closer to those fromweakly augmented views for better generalizability. Meanwhile, we propose andevaluate three kinds of strong augmentations for 3D skeletons to demonstratethe effectiveness of our method.

In Ske2Grid, we define a regularconvolution operation upon a novel grid representation of human skeleton, whichis a compact image-like grid patch constructed and learned through three noveldesigns. Specifically, we propose a graph-node index transform (GIT) toconstruct a regular grid patch through assigning the nodes in the skeletongraph one by one to the desired grid cells. To ensure that GIT is a bijectionand enrich the expressiveness of the grid representation, an up-samplingtransform (UPT) is learned to interpolate the skeleton graph nodes for fillingthe grid patch to the full. To resolve the problem when the one-step UPT isaggressive and further exploit the representation capability of the grid patchwith increasing spatial size, a progressive learning strategy (PLS) is proposedwhich decouples the UPT into multiple steps and aligns them to multiple pairedGITs through a compact cascaded design learned progressively. We constructnetworks upon prevailing graph convolution networks and conduct experiments onsix mainstream skeleton-based action recognition datasets. Experiments showthat our Ske2Grid significantly outperforms existing GCN-based solutions underdifferent benchmark settings, without bells and whistles.

Nevertheless, deep models often sufferfrom the overfitting effect on small-scale datasets with a limited number oftraining videos. A common solution is to exploit the existing imageaugmentation strategies for each frame individually including Mixup, Cutmix,and RandAugment, which are not particularly optimized for video data. In thispaper, we propose a novel video augmentation strategy named Selective VolumeMixup (SV-Mix) to improve the generalization ability of deep models withlimited training videos. SV-Mix devises a learnable selective module to choosethe most informative volumes from two videos and mixes the volumes up toachieve a new training video. Technically, we propose two new modules, i.e., aspatial selective module to select the local patches for each spatial position,and a temporal selective module to mix the entire frames for each timestamp andmaintain the spatial pattern. At each time, we randomly choose one of the twomodules to expand the diversity of training samples. The selective modules arejointly optimized with the video action recognition framework to find theoptimal augmentation strategy. We empirically demonstrate the merits of theSV-Mix augmentation on a wide range of video action recognition benchmarks andconsistently boot the performances of both CNN-based and transformer-basedmodels.</description><author>Yi Tan, Zhaofan Qiu, Yanbin Hao, Ting Yao, Xiangnan He, Tao Mei</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 08:26:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09534v1</guid></item><item><title>FMM-X3D: FPGA-based modeling and mapping of X3D for Human Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18479v1</link><description>3D Convolutional Neural Networks are gaining increasing attention fromresearchers and practitioners and have found applications in many domains, suchas surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, human monitoring systems, andvideo retrieval.

Then a progressivecurriculum balances learning the discriminative information from the sourcedataset with the generic information learned from the target domain. Initially,our curriculum utilizes supervised learning to learn class discriminativefeatures from the source data. As the training progresses, we transition tolearning target-domain-specific features. We propose a progressive curriculumto encourage the emergence of rich features in the target domain based on classdiscriminative supervised features in the source domain. We evaluate our methodon several challenging benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our approachoutperforms existing cross-domain few-shot learning techniques.

WhileConvolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have shown remarkable success in imagerecognition, they are not always directly applicable to HAR, as temporalfeatures are critical for accurate classification. In this paper, we propose anovel dynamic PSO-ConvNet model for learning actions in videos, building on ourrecent work in image recognition. Our approach leverages a framework where theweight vector of each neural network represents the position of a particle inphase space, and particles share their current weight vectors and gradientestimates of the Loss function. To extend our approach to video, we integrateConvNets with state-of-the-art temporal methods such as Transformer andRecurrent Neural Networks. Our experimental results on the UCF-101 datasetdemonstrate substantial improvements of up to 9% in accuracy, which confirmsthe effectiveness of our proposed method. In addition, we conducted experimentson larger and more variety of datasets including Kinetics-400 and HMDB-51 andobtained preference for Collaborative Learning in comparison withNon-Collaborative Learning (Individual Learning). Overall, our dynamicPSO-ConvNet model provides a promising direction for improving HAR by bettercapturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of human actions in videos.

The current state-of-the-art enablessuch a zero-shot recognition by learning universal mappings from videos to asemantic space, either trained on large-scale seen actions or on objects. Whileeffective, we find that universal action and object mappings are biased tospecific regions in the semantic space. These biases lead to a fundamentalproblem: many unseen action categories are simply never inferred duringtesting. For example on UCF-101, a quarter of the unseen actions are out ofreach with a state-of-the-art universal action model. To that end, this paperintroduces universal prototype transport for zero-shot action recognition. Themain idea is to re-position the semantic prototypes of unseen actions bymatching them to the distribution of all test videos. For universal actionmodels, we propose to match distributions through a hyperspherical optimaltransport from unseen action prototypes to the set of all projected testvideos. The resulting transport couplings in turn determine the targetprototype for each unseen action. Rather than directly using the targetprototype as final result, we re-position unseen action prototypes along thegeodesic spanned by the original and target prototypes as a form of semanticregularization. For universal object models, we outline a variant that definestarget prototypes based on an optimal transport between unseen actionprototypes and object prototypes. Empirically, we show that universal prototypetransport diminishes the biased selection of unseen action prototypes andboosts both universal action and object models for zero-shot classification andspatio-temporal localization.</description><author>Pascal Mettes</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 10:21:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03971v2</guid></item><item><title>What can a cook in Italy teach a mechanic in India?

Previous studies only utilizethe action labels of verb phrases as the semantic prototypes for learning themapping from skeleton-based actions to a shared semantic space. However, thelimited semantic information of action labels restricts the generalizationability of skeleton features for recognizing unseen actions. In order to solvethis dilemma, we propose a multi-semantic fusion (MSF) model for improving theperformance of GZSSAR, where two kinds of class-level textual descriptions(i.e., action descriptions and motion descriptions), are collected as auxiliarysemantic information to enhance the learning efficacy of generalizable skeletonfeatures. Specially, a pre-trained language encoder takes the actiondescriptions, motion descriptions and original class labels as inputs to obtainrich semantic features for each action class, while a skeleton encoder isimplemented to extract skeleton features. Then, a variational autoencoder (VAE)based generative module is performed to learn a cross-modal alignment betweenskeleton and semantic features. Finally, a classification module is built torecognize the action categories of input samples, where a seen-unseenclassification gate is adopted to predict whether the sample comes from seenaction classes or not in GZSSAR. The superior performance in comparisons withprevious models validates the effectiveness of the proposed MSF model onGZSSAR.</description><author>Ming-Zhe Li, Zhen Jia, Zhang Zhang, Zhanyu Ma, Liang Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 10:00:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09592v1</guid></item><item><title>Act-VIT: A Representationally Robust Attention Architecture for Skeleton Based Action Recognition Using Vision Transformer</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08094v1</link><description>Skeleton-based action recognition receives the attention of many researchersas it is robust to viewpoint and illumination changes, and its processing ismuch more efficient than video frames. With the emergence of deep learningmodels, it has become very popular to represent the skeleton data inpseudo-image form and apply Convolutional Neural Networks for actionrecognition. Thereafter, studies concentrated on finding effective methods forforming pseudo-images. Recently, attention networks, more specificallytransformers have provided promising results in various vision problems. Inthis study, the effectiveness of vision transformers for skeleton-based actionrecognition is examined and its robustness on the pseudo-image representationscheme is investigated. To this end, a three-level architecture, Act-VIT isproposed, which forms a set of pseudo images apply a classifier on each of therepresentation and combine their results to find the final action class. Theclassifiers of Act-VIT are first realized by CNNs and then by VITs and theirperformances are compared. Experimental studies reveal that the visiontransformer is less sensitive to the initial pseudo-image representationcompared to CNN. Nevertheless, even with the vision transformer, therecognition performance can be further improved by consensus of classifiers.</description><author>Ozge Oztimur Karadag</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 11:38:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08094v1</guid></item><item><title>Multimodal Prototype-Enhanced Network for Few-Shot Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04873v2</link><description>Current methods for few-shot action recognition mainly fall into the metriclearning framework following ProtoNet, which demonstrates the importance ofprototypes.

In the text flow, a semantic-enhanced (SE) module and an inflatingoperation are used to obtain text prototypes. The final multimodal prototypesare then computed by a multimodal prototype-enhanced (MPE) module.

Supervised by the semantics of action labels, recent works adaptthe visual branch of VLMs to learn video representations. Despite theeffectiveness proved by these works, we believe that the potential of VLMs hasyet to be fully harnessed. In light of this, we exploit the semantic units (SU)hiding behind the action labels and leverage their correlations withfine-grained items in frames for more accurate action recognition. SUs areentities extracted from the language descriptions of the entire action set,including body parts, objects, scenes, and motions. To further enhance thealignments between visual contents and the SUs, we introduce a multi-regionmodule (MRA) to the visual branch of the VLM. The MRA allows the perception ofregion-aware visual features beyond the original global feature. Our methodadaptively attends to and selects relevant SUs with visual features of frames.With a cross-modal decoder, the selected SUs serve to decode spatiotemporalvideo representations. In summary, the SUs as the medium can boostdiscriminative ability and transferability. Specifically, in fully-supervisedlearning, our method achieved 87.8% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400.

The task is challenging due to the high dimensionalitynature of an action, as well as the subtle motion details to be considered.Current state-of-the-art approaches typically learn from articulated motionsequences in the straightforward 3D Euclidean space. However, the vanillaEuclidean space is not efficient for modeling important motion characteristicssuch as the joint-wise angular acceleration, which reveals the driving forcebehind the motion. Moreover, current methods typically attend to each channelequally and lack theoretical constrains on extracting task-relevant featuresfrom the input. In this paper, we seek to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) Wepropose to incorporate an acceleration representation, explicitly modeling thehigher-order variations in motion. (2) We introduce a novel Stream-GCN networkequipped with multi-stream components and channel attention, where differentrepresentations (i.e., streams) supplement each other towards a more preciseaction recognition while attention capitalizes on those important channels.

However, vision transformersstill struggle with geometric variations prevalent in video data. This paperproposes a novel approach, GeoDeformer, designed to capture the variationsinherent in action video by integrating geometric comprehension directly intothe ViT architecture. Specifically, at the core of GeoDeformer is the GeometricDeformation Predictor, a module designed to identify and quantify potentialspatial and temporal geometric deformations within the given video. Spatialdeformations adjust the geometry within individual frames, while temporaldeformations capture the cross-frame geometric dynamics, reflecting motion andtemporal progression. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, weincorporate it into the established MViTv2 framework, replacing the standardself-attention blocks with GeoDeformer blocks. Our experiments at UCF101,HMDB51, and Mini-K200 achieve significant increases in both Top-1 and Top-5accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art results with only a marginalincrease in computational cost. Additionally, visualizations affirm thatGeoDeformer effectively manifests explicit geometric deformations and minimizesgeometric variations.

For this reason, in the context of multi-modalaction recognition, it is important to consider not only the overall actioncontent but also the complementary nature of different modalities. In thispaper, we propose a novel network, named Modality Mixer (M-Mixer) network,which effectively leverages and incorporates the complementary informationacross modalities with the temporal context of actions for action recognition.A key component of our proposed M-Mixer is the Multi-modal ContextualizationUnit (MCU), a simple yet effective recurrent unit. Our MCU is responsible fortemporally encoding a sequence of one modality (e.g., RGB) with action contentfeatures of other modalities (e.g., depth and infrared modalities). Thisprocess encourages M-Mixer network to exploit global action content and also tosupplement complementary information of other modalities.

Byusing the verb-noun co-occurrence matrix generated from the dataset, we observea moderate improvement in model performance compared to our baseline framework.To further enhance the model's adaptability to novel action labels, weexperiment with rules generated using GPT-3.5, which leads to a slight decreasein performance. These findings shed light on the potential and challenges ofincorporating differentiable logic and LLMs for knowledge extraction inunsupervised domain adaptation for action recognition. Our final submission(entitled `NS-LLM') achieved the first place in terms of top-1 actionrecognition accuracy.</description><author>Yi Cheng, Ziwei Xu, Fen Fang, Dongyun Lin, Hehe Fan, Yongkang Wong, Ying Sun, Mohan Kankanhalli</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2023 06:54:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06569v1</guid></item><item><title>Elevating Skeleton-Based Action Recognition with Efficient Multi-Modality Self-Supervision</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12009v1</link><description>Self-supervised representation learning for human action recognition hasdeveloped rapidly in recent years. Most of the existing works are based onskeleton data while using a multi-modality setup. These works overlooked thedifferences in performance among modalities, which led to the propagation oferroneous knowledge between modalities while only three fundamental modalities,i.e., joints, bones, and motions are used, hence no additional modalities areexplored. In this work, we first propose an Implicit Knowledge Exchange Module (IKEM)which alleviates the propagation of erroneous knowledge between low-performancemodalities. Then, we further propose three new modalities to enrich thecomplementary information between modalities. Finally, to maintain efficiencywhen introducing new modalities, we propose a novel teacher-student frameworkto distill the knowledge from the secondary modalities into the mandatorymodalities considering the relationship constrained by anchors, positives, andnegatives, named relational cross-modality knowledge distillation. Theexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, unlockingthe efficient use of skeleton-based multi-modality data.

To solve this, we propose a hierarchically decomposed graphconvolutional network (HD-GCN) architecture with a novel hierarchicallydecomposed graph (HD-Graph). The proposed HD-GCN effectively decomposes everyjoint node into several sets to extract major structurally adjacent and distantedges, and uses them to construct an HD-Graph containing those edges in thesame semantic spaces of a human skeleton. In addition, we introduce anattention-guided hierarchy aggregation (A-HA) module to highlight the dominanthierarchical edge sets of the HD-Graph. Furthermore, we apply a new six-wayensemble method, which uses only joint and bone stream without any motionstream. The proposed model is evaluated and achieves state-of-the-artperformance on four large, popular datasets. Finally, we demonstrate theeffectiveness of our model with various comparative experiments.</description><author>Jungho Lee, Minhyeok Lee, Dogyoon Lee, Sangyoun Lee</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 10:15:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10741v3</guid></item><item><title>Temporal-Distributed Backdoor Attack Against Video Based Action Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11070v1</link><description>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in variousapplications including video action recognition, yet remain vulnerable tobackdoor attacks (Trojans).

It hasbeen observed that the semantic distinction of human action features is oftenrepresented by local body parts, such as legs or hands, which are advantageousfor skeleton-based action recognition. This paper proposes an attention-basedcontrastive learning framework for skeleton representation learning, calledSkeAttnCLR, which integrates local similarity and global features forskeleton-based action representations. To achieve this, a multi-head attentionmask module is employed to learn the soft attention mask features from theskeletons, suppressing non-salient local features while accentuating localsalient features, thereby bringing similar local features closer in the featurespace. Additionally, ample contrastive pairs are generated by expandingcontrastive pairs based on salient and non-salient features with globalfeatures, which guide the network to learn the semantic representations of theentire skeleton. Therefore, with the attention mask mechanism, SkeAttnCLRlearns local features under different data augmentation views. The experimentresults demonstrate that the inclusion of local feature similaritysignificantly enhances skeleton-based action representation. Our proposedSkeAttnCLR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NTURGB+D, NTU120-RGB+D, andPKU-MMD datasets.</description><author>Yilei Hua, Wenhan Wu, Ce Zheng, Aidong Lu, Mengyuan Liu, Chen Chen, Shiqian Wu</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 08:26:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00666v2</guid></item><item><title>MAtch, eXpand and Improve: Unsupervised Finetuning for Zero-Shot Action Recognition with Language Knowledge</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08914v2</link><description>Large scale Vision-Language (VL) models have shown tremendous success inaligning representations between visual and text modalities. This enablesremarkable progress in zero-shot recognition, image generation &amp; editing, andmany other exciting tasks. However, VL models tend to over-represent objectswhile paying much less attention to verbs, and require additional tuning onvideo data for best zero-shot action recognition performance. While previouswork relied on large-scale, fully-annotated data, in this work we propose anunsupervised approach. We adapt a VL model for zero-shot and few-shot actionrecognition using a collection of unlabeled videos and an unpaired actiondictionary. Based on that, we leverage Large Language Models and VL models tobuild a text bag for each unlabeled video via matching, text expansion andcaptioning. We use those bags in a Multiple Instance Learning setup to adapt animage-text backbone to video data. Although finetuned on unlabeled video data,our resulting models demonstrate high transferability to numerous unseenzero-shot downstream tasks, improving the base VL model performance by up to14\%, and even comparing favorably to fully-supervised baselines in bothzero-shot and few-shot video recognition transfer.

The analysis and monitoring of theprocesses is necessary for efficient production design. Traditional methods foranalyzing manual processes are complex, expensive, and inflexible. Compared toestablished approaches such as Methods-Time-Measurement (MTM), machine learning(ML) methods promise: Higher flexibility, self-sufficient &amp; permanent use,lower costs. In this work, based on a video stream, the current motion class ina manual assembly process is detected. With information on the current motion,Key-Performance-Indicators (KPIs) can be derived easily. A skeleton-basedaction recognition approach is taken, as this field recently shows majorsuccess in machine vision tasks. For skeleton-based action recognition inmanual assembly, no sufficient pre-work could be found. Therefore, a MLpipeline is developed, to enable extensive research on different (pre-)processing methods and neural nets. Suitable well generalizing approaches arefound, proving the potential of ML to enhance analyzation of manual processes.Models detect the current motion, performed by an operator in manual assembly,but the results can be transferred to all kinds of manual processes.</description><author>Marlin Berger, Frederik Cloppenburg, Jens Eufinger, Thomas Gries</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 17:11:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08451v1</guid></item></channel></rss>

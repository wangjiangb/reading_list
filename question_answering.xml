Due to thedynamics of knowledge facts in real world, knowledge editing has been exploredto update model with the up-to-date facts while avoiding expensive re-trainingor fine-tuning. Starting from the edited fact, the updated model needs toprovide cascading changes in the chain of MQA. The previous art simply adopts amix-up prompt to instruct LLMs conducting multiple reasoning taskssequentially, including question decomposition, answer generation, and conflictchecking via comparing with edited facts. However, the coupling of thesefunctionally-diverse reasoning tasks inhibits LLMs' advantages in comprehendingand answering questions while disturbing them with the unskilled task ofconflict checking. We thus propose a framework, Programmable knowledge editingfor Multi-hop Question Answering (PokeMQA), to decouple the jobs. Specifically,we prompt LLMs to decompose knowledge-augmented multi-hop question, whileinteracting with a detached trainable scope detector to modulate LLMs behaviordepending on external conflict signal. The experiments on three LLM backbonesand two benchmark datasets validate our superiority in knowledge editing ofMQA, outperforming all competitors by a large margin in almost all settings andconsistently producing reliable reasoning process.</description><author>Hengrui Gu, Kaixiong Zhou, Xiaotian Han, Ninghao Liu, Ruobing Wang, Xin Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 03:10:29 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15194v2</guid></item><item><title>Unsupervised LLM Adaptation for Question Answering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12170v1</link><description>Large language models (LLM) learn diverse knowledge present in thelarge-scale training dataset via self-supervised training. Followed byinstruction-tuning, LLM acquires the ability to return correct information fordiverse questions. However, adapting these pre-trained LLMs to new targetdomains, such as different organizations or periods, for the question-answering(QA) task incurs a substantial annotation cost. To tackle this challenge, wepropose a novel task, unsupervised LLM adaptation for question answering. Inthis task, we leverage a pre-trained LLM, a publicly available QA dataset(source data), and unlabeled documents from the target domain. Our goal is tolearn LLM that can answer questions about the target domain. We introduce onesynthetic and two real datasets to evaluate models fine-tuned on the source andtarget data, and reveal intriguing insights; (i) fine-tuned models exhibit theability to provide correct answers for questions about the target domain eventhough they do not see any questions about the information described in theunlabeled documents, but (ii) they have difficulties in accessing informationlocated in the middle or at the end of documents, and (iii) this challenge canbe partially mitigated by replacing input tokens with random ones duringadaptation.</description><author>Kuniaki Saito, Kihyuk Sohn, Chen-Yu Lee, Yoshitaka Ushiku</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 06:29:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12170v1</guid></item><item><title>NuScenes-QA: A Multi-modal Visual Question Answering Benchmark for Autonomous Driving Scenario</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14836v2</link><description>We introduce a novel visual question answering (VQA) task in the context ofautonomous driving, aiming to answer natural language questions based onstreet-view clues. Compared to traditional VQA tasks, VQA in autonomous drivingscenario presents more challenges. Firstly, the raw visual data aremulti-modal, including images and point clouds captured by camera and LiDAR,respectively. Secondly, the data are multi-frame due to the continuous,real-time acquisition. Thirdly, the outdoor scenes exhibit both movingforeground and static background. Existing VQA benchmarks fail to adequatelyaddress these complexities. To bridge this gap, we propose NuScenes-QA, thefirst benchmark for VQA in the autonomous driving scenario, encompassing 34Kvisual scenes and 460K question-answer pairs. Specifically, we leverageexisting 3D detection annotations to generate scene graphs and design questiontemplates manually. Subsequently, the question-answer pairs are generatedprogrammatically based on these templates. Comprehensive statistics prove thatour NuScenes-QA is a balanced large-scale benchmark with diverse questionformats. Built upon it, we develop a series of baselines that employ advanced3D detection and VQA techniques. Our extensive experiments highlight thechallenges posed by this new task.

On the otherhand, building good deep-learning models for low-resource languages remains achallenging task. This paper focuses on developing a Question Answering datasetfor two such languages- Hindi and Marathi. Despite Hindi being the 3rd mostspoken language worldwide, with 345 million speakers, and Marathi being the11th most spoken language globally, with 83.2 million speakers, both languagesface limited resources for building efficient Question Answering systems. Totackle the challenge of data scarcity, we have developed a novel approach fortranslating the SQuAD 2.0 dataset into Hindi and Marathi. We release thelargest Question-Answering dataset available for these languages, with eachdataset containing 28,000 samples. We evaluate the dataset on variousarchitectures and release the best-performing models for both Hindi andMarathi, which will facilitate further research in these languages. Leveragingsimilarity tools, our method holds the potential to create datasets in diverselanguages, thereby enhancing the understanding of natural language acrossvaried linguistic contexts. Our fine-tuned models, code, and dataset will bemade publicly available.</description><author>Maithili Sabane, Onkar Litake, Aman Chadha</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2024 07:02:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09862v3</guid></item><item><title>CFMatch: Aligning Automated Answer Equivalence Evaluation with Expert Judgments For Open-Domain Question Answering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13170v2</link><description>Question answering (QA) can only make progress if we know if an answer iscorrect, but for many of the most challenging and interesting QA examples,current evaluation metrics to determine answer equivalence (AE) often do notalign with human judgments, particularly more verbose, free-form answers fromlarge language models (LLM). There are two challenges: a lack of data and thatmodels are too big: LLM-based scorers can correlate better with human judges,but this task has only been tested on limited QA datasets, and even whenavailable, update of the model is limited because LLMs are large and oftenexpensive. We rectify both of these issues by providing clear and consistentguidelines for evaluating AE in machine QA adopted from professional human QAcontests. We also introduce a combination of standard evaluation and a moreefficient, robust, and lightweight discriminate AE classifier-based matchingmethod (CFMatch, smaller than 1 MB), trained and validated to more accuratelyevaluate answer correctness in accordance with adopted expert AE rules that aremore aligned with human judgments.</description><author>Zongxia Li, Ishani Mondal, Yijun Liang, Huy Nghiem, Jordan Boyd-Graber</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 19:37:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13170v2</guid></item><item><title>Pretraining Vision-Language Model for Difference Visual Question Answering in Longitudinal Chest X-rays</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08966v1</link><description>Difference visual question answering (diff-VQA) is a challenging task thatrequires answering complex questions based on differences between a pair ofimages. This task is particularly important in reading chest X-ray imagesbecause radiologists often compare multiple images of the same patient taken atdifferent times to track disease progression and changes in its severity intheir clinical practice. However, previous works focused on designing specificnetwork architectures for the diff-VQA task, missing opportunities to enhancethe model's performance using a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). Here,we introduce a novel VLM called PLURAL, which is pretrained on natural andlongitudinal chest X-ray data for the diff-VQA task. The model is developedusing a step-by-step approach, starting with being pretrained on natural imagesand texts, followed by being trained using longitudinal chest X-ray data. Thelongitudinal data consist of pairs of X-ray images, along with question-answersets and radiologist's reports that describe the changes in lung abnormalitiesand diseases over time. Our experimental results show that the PLURAL modeloutperforms state-of-the-art methods not only in diff-VQA for longitudinalX-rays but also in conventional VQA for a single X-ray image. Through extensiveexperiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VLM architectureand pretraining method in improving the model's performance.</description><author>Yeongjae Cho, Taehee Kim, Heejun Shin, Sungzoon Cho, Dongmyung Shin</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2024 06:20:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08966v1</guid></item><item><title>Question Answering Over Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11542v1</link><description>Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) extend the concept of knowledgegraphs (KGs) by incorporating time and location information. While the researchcommunity's focus on Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA), the field ofanswering questions incorporating both spatio-temporal information based onSTKGs remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, a lack of comprehensive datasetsalso has hindered progress in this area. To address this issue, we presentSTQAD, a dataset comprising 10,000 natural language questions forspatio-temporal knowledge graph question answering (STKGQA). Unfortunately,various state-of-the-art KGQA approaches fall far short of achievingsatisfactory performance on our dataset. In response, we propose STCQA, a newspatio-temporal KGQA approach that utilizes a novel STKG embedding method namedSTComplEx. By extracting temporal and spatial information from a question, ourQA model can better comprehend the question and retrieve accurate answers fromthe STKG. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the quality of ourdataset and the effectiveness of our STKGQA method.</description><author>Xinbang Dai, Huiying Li, Guilin Qi</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2024 10:44:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11542v1</guid></item><item><title>PAT-Questions: A Self-Updating Benchmark for Present-Anchored Temporal Question-Answering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11034v1</link><description>Existing work on Temporal Question Answering (TQA) has predominantly focusedon questions anchored to specific timestamps or events (e.g. "Who was the USpresident in 1970?"). Little work has studied questions whose temporal contextis relative to the present time (e.g. "Who was the previous US president?"). Werefer to this problem as Present-Anchored Temporal QA (PATQA). PATQA posesunique challenges: (1) large language models (LLMs) may have outdatedknowledge, (2) complex temporal relationships (e.g. 'before', 'previous') arehard to reason, (3) multi-hop reasoning may be required, and (4) the goldanswers of benchmarks must be continuously updated. To address thesechallenges, we introduce the PAT-Questions benchmark, which includes single andmulti-hop temporal questions. The answers in PAT-Questions can be automaticallyrefreshed by re-running SPARQL queries on a knowledge graph, if available. Weevaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs and a SOTA temporal reasoning model(TEMPREASON-T5) on PAT-Questions through direct prompting andretrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The results highlight the limitations ofexisting solutions in PATQA and motivate the need for new methods to improvePATQA reasoning capabilities.</description><author>Jannat Ara Meem, Muhammad Shihab Rashid, Yue Dong, Vagelis Hristidis</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 19:26:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11034v1</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Hybrid Question Answering via Program-based Prompting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10812v1</link><description>Question answering over heterogeneous data requires reasoning over diversesources of data, which is challenging due to the large scale of information andorganic coupling of heterogeneous data. Various approaches have been proposedto address these challenges. One approach involves training specializedretrievers to select relevant information, thereby reducing the input length.Another approach is to transform diverse modalities of data into a singlemodality, simplifying the task difficulty and enabling more straightforwardprocessing. In this paper, we propose HProPro, a novel program-based promptingframework for the hybrid question answering task. HProPro follows the codegeneration and execution paradigm. In addition, HProPro integrates variousfunctions to tackle the hybrid reasoning scenario. Specifically, HProProcontains function declaration and function implementation to perform hybridinformation-seeking over data from various sources and modalities, whichenables reasoning over such data without training specialized retrievers orperforming modal transformations. Experimental results on two typical hybridquestion answering benchmarks HybridQA and MultiModalQA demonstrate theeffectiveness of HProPro: it surpasses all baseline systems and achieves thebest performances in the few-shot settings on both datasets.</description><author>Qi Shi, Han Cui, Haofeng Wang, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che, Ting Liu</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 16:35:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10812v1</guid></item><item><title>Question Calibration and Multi-Hop Modeling for Temporal Question Answering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13188v1</link><description>Many models that leverage knowledge graphs (KGs) have recently demonstratedremarkable success in question answering (QA) tasks. In the real world, manyfacts contained in KGs are time-constrained thus temporal KGQA has receivedincreasing attention. Despite the fruitful efforts of previous models intemporal KGQA, they still have several limitations. (I) They adopt pre-trainedlanguage models (PLMs) to obtain question representations, while PLMs tend tofocus on entity information and ignore entity transfer caused by temporalconstraints, and finally fail to learn specific temporal representations ofentities. (II) They neither emphasize the graph structure between entities norexplicitly model the multi-hop relationship in the graph, which will make itdifficult to solve complex multi-hop question answering. To alleviate thisproblem, we propose a novel Question Calibration and Multi-Hop Modeling(QC-MHM) approach. Specifically, We first calibrate the question representationby fusing the question and the time-constrained concepts in KG. Then, weconstruct the GNN layer to complete multi-hop message passing. Finally, thequestion representation is combined with the embedding output by the GNN togenerate the final prediction. Empirical results verify that the proposed modelachieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models in the benchmarkdataset. Notably, the Hits@1 and Hits@10 results of QC-MHM on the CronQuestionsdataset's complex questions are absolutely improved by 5.1% and 1.2% comparedto the best-performing baseline. Moreover, QC-MHM can generate interpretableand trustworthy predictions.</description><author>Chao Xue, Di Liang, Pengfei Wang, Jing Zhang</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 17:56:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13188v1</guid></item><item><title>Sports-QA: A Large-Scale Video Question Answering Benchmark for Complex and Professional Sports</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01505v3</link><description>Reasoning over sports videos for question answering is an important task withnumerous applications, such as player training and information retrieval.However, this task has not been explored due to the lack of relevant datasetsand the challenging nature it presents. Most datasets for video questionanswering (VideoQA) focus mainly on general and coarse-grained understanding ofdaily-life videos, which is not applicable to sports scenarios requiringprofessional action understanding and fine-grained motion analysis. In thispaper, we introduce the first dataset, named Sports-QA, specifically designedfor the sports VideoQA task. The Sports-QA dataset includes various types ofquestions, such as descriptions, chronologies, causalities, and counterfactualconditions, covering multiple sports. Furthermore, to address thecharacteristics of the sports VideoQA task, we propose a new Auto-FocusTransformer (AFT) capable of automatically focusing on particular scales oftemporal information for question answering. We conduct extensive experimentson Sports-QA, including baseline studies and the evaluation of differentmethods.

Traditionally, task-specific models are developed for individualtasks and designing such models requires distinct expertise. Building upon thesuccess of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP),there is a similar trend in computer vision, which focuses on developinglarge-scale models through pretraining and in-context learning. This paradigmshift reduces the reliance on task-specific models, yielding a powerful unifiedmodel to deal with various tasks. However, these advances have predominantlyconcentrated on high-level vision tasks, with less attention paid to low-levelvision tasks. To address this issue, we propose a universal model for generalimage processing that covers image restoration, image enhancement, imagefeature extraction tasks, etc. Our proposed framework, named PromptGIP, unifiesthese diverse image processing tasks within a universal framework. Inspired byNLP question answering (QA) techniques, we employ a visual prompting questionanswering paradigm. Specifically, we treat the input-output image pair as astructured question-answer sentence, thereby reprogramming the image processingtask as a prompting QA problem. PromptGIP can undertake diverse cross-domaintasks using provided visual prompts, eliminating the need for task-specificfinetuning. Our methodology offers a universal and adaptive solution to generalimage processing. While PromptGIP has demonstrated a certain degree ofout-of-domain task generalization capability, further research is expected tofully explore its more powerful emergent generalization.</description><author>Yihao Liu, Xiangyu Chen, Xianzheng Ma, Xintao Wang, Jiantao Zhou, Yu Qiao, Chao Dong</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2024 03:31:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10513v2</guid></item><item><title>II-MMR: Identifying and Improving Multi-modal Multi-hop Reasoning in Visual Question Answering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11058v1</link><description>Visual Question Answering (VQA) often involves diverse reasoning scenariosacross Vision and Language (V&amp;L). Most prior VQA studies, however, have merelyfocused on assessing the model's overall accuracy without evaluating it ondifferent reasoning cases. Furthermore, some recent works observe thatconventional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting fails to generate effectivereasoning for VQA, especially for complex scenarios requiring multi-hopreasoning. In this paper, we propose II-MMR, a novel idea to identify andimprove multi-modal multi-hop reasoning in VQA. In specific, II-MMR takes a VQAquestion with an image and finds a reasoning path to reach its answer using twonovel language promptings: (i) answer prediction-guided CoT prompt, or (ii)knowledge triplet-guided prompt. II-MMR then analyzes this path to identifydifferent reasoning cases in current VQA benchmarks by estimating how many hopsand what types (i.e., visual or beyond-visual) of reasoning are required toanswer the question. On popular benchmarks including GQA and A-OKVQA, II-MMRobserves that most of their VQA questions are easy to answer, simply demanding"single-hop" reasoning, whereas only a few questions require "multi-hop"reasoning. Moreover, while the recent V&amp;L model struggles with such complexmulti-hop reasoning questions even using the traditional CoT method, II-MMRshows its effectiveness across all reasoning cases in both zero-shot andfine-tuning settings.</description><author>Jihyung Kil, Farideh Tavazoee, Dongyeop Kang, Joo-Kyung Kim</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 20:14:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11058v1</guid></item><item><title>Modality-Aware Integration with Large Language Models for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12728v1</link><description>Knowledge-based visual question answering (KVQA) has been extensively studiedto answer visual questions with external knowledge, e.g., knowledge graphs(KGs). While several attempts have been proposed to leverage large languagemodels (LLMs) as an implicit knowledge source, it remains challenging sinceLLMs may generate hallucinations. Moreover, multiple knowledge sources, e.g.,images, KGs and LLMs, cannot be readily aligned for complex scenarios. Totackle these, we present a novel modality-aware integration with LLMs for KVQA(MAIL). It carefully leverages multimodal knowledge for both imageunderstanding and knowledge reasoning. Specifically, (i) we propose a two-stageprompting strategy with LLMs to densely embody the image into a scene graphwith detailed visual features; (ii) We construct a coupled concept graph bylinking the mentioned entities with external facts. (iii) A tailoredpseudo-siamese graph medium fusion is designed for sufficient multimodalfusion. We utilize the shared mentioned entities in two graphs as mediums tobridge a tight inter-modal exchange, while maximally preserving insightfulintra-modal learning by constraining the fusion within mediums.

Although the ``pre-training &amp; finetuning''learning paradigm significantly improves the VQA performance, the adversarialrobustness of such a learning paradigm has not been explored. In this paper, wedelve into a new problem: using a pre-trained multimodal source model to createadversarial image-text pairs and then transferring them to attack the targetVQA models. Correspondingly, we propose a novel VQAttack model, which caniteratively generate both image and text perturbations with the designedmodules: the large language model (LLM)-enhanced image attack and thecross-modal joint attack module. At each iteration, the LLM-enhanced imageattack module first optimizes the latent representation-based loss to generatefeature-level image perturbations. Then it incorporates an LLM to furtherenhance the image perturbations by optimizing the designed masked answeranti-recovery loss. The cross-modal joint attack module will be triggered at aspecific iteration, which updates the image and text perturbationssequentially. Notably, the text perturbation updates are based on both thelearned gradients in the word embedding space and word synonym-basedsubstitution. Experimental results on two VQA datasets with five validatedmodels demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VQAttack in thetransferable attack setting, compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Thisimplies that training is limited to surface forms seen in the respectivedatasets, and evaluation is on a small set of held-out questions. Through ourproposed framework REIGN, we take several steps to remedy this restrictedlearning setup. First, we systematically generate reformulations of trainingquestions to increase robustness of models to surface form variations. This isa particularly challenging problem, given the incomplete nature of suchquestions.

However, domain data oftenexists in a hybrid format, including text and semi-structured tables, posingchallenges for the seamless integration of information. Table-to-TextGeneration is a promising solution by facilitating the transformation of hybriddata into a uniformly text-formatted corpus. Although this technique has beenwidely studied by the NLP community, there is currently no comparative analysison how corpora generated by different table-to-text methods affect theperformance of QA systems. In this paper, we address this research gap in twosteps. First, we innovatively integrate table-to-text generation into theframework of enhancing LLM-based QA systems with domain hybrid data. Then, weutilize this framework in real-world industrial data to conduct extensiveexperiments on two types of QA systems (DSFT and RAG frameworks) with fourrepresentative methods: Markdown format, Template serialization, TPLM-basedmethod, and LLM-based method. Based on the experimental results, we draw someempirical findings and explore the underlying reasons behind the success ofsome methods.

Although augmenting themwith relevant external information can mitigate these issues, failure toconsider the necessity of retrieval may adversely affect overall performance.Previous research has primarily focused on examining how entities influenceretrieval models and knowledge recall in LMs, leaving other aspects relativelyunexplored.

However, as models growincreasingly sophisticated, they will surpass human expertise, and the role ofhuman evaluation will evolve into non-experts overseeing experts. Inanticipation of this, we ask: can weaker models assess the correctness ofstronger models? We investigate this question in an analogous setting, wherestronger models (experts) possess the necessary information to answer questionsand weaker models (non-experts) lack this information. The method we evaluateis \textit{debate}, where two LLM experts each argue for a different answer,and a non-expert selects the answer. We find that debate consistently helpsboth non-expert models and humans answer questions, achieving 76\% and 88\%accuracy respectively (naive baselines obtain 48\% and 60\%). Furthermore,optimising expert debaters for persuasiveness in an unsupervised mannerimproves non-expert ability to identify the truth in debates.

However,structured explanations demand models to perform intricately structuredreasoning, which poses great challenges. Most existing methods focus onsingle-step reasoning through supervised learning, ignoring logicaldependencies between steps. Moreover, existing reinforcement learning (RL)based methods overlook the structured relationships, underutilizing thepotential of RL in structured reasoning. In this paper, we propose SEER, anovel method that maximizes a structure-based return to facilitate structuredreasoning and explanation.

A pivotalchallenge is the development of an efficient method to encapsulate videocontent into a set of representative tokens to align with LLMs. In this work,we introduce Slot-VLM, a novel framework designed to generate semanticallydecomposed video tokens, in terms of object-wise and event-wise visualrepresentations, to facilitate LLM inference. Particularly, we design aSlowFast Slots module, i.e., SF-Slots, that adaptively aggregates the densevideo tokens from the CLIP vision encoder to a set of representative slots. Inorder to take into account both the spatial object details and the variedtemporal dynamics, SF-Slots is built with a dual-branch structure. TheSlow-Slots branch focuses on extracting object-centric slots from features athigh spatial resolution but low (slow) frame sample rate, emphasizing detailedobject information. Conversely, Fast-Slots branch is engineered to learnevent-centric slots from high temporal sample rate but low spatial resolutionfeatures. These complementary slots are combined to form the vision context,serving as the input to the LLM for efficient question answering. Ourexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our Slot-VLM, whichachieves the state-of-the-art performance on video question-answering.</description><author>Jiaqi Xu, Cuiling Lan, Wenxuan Xie, Xuejin Chen, Yan Lu</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 15:30:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13088v1</guid></item><item><title>MoRAL: MoE Augmented LoRA for LLMs' Lifelong Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11260v1</link><description>Adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains/tasks and enabling themto be efficient lifelong learners is a pivotal challenge. In this paper, wepropose MoRAL, i.e., Mixture-of-Experts augmented Low-Rank Adaptation forLifelong Learning. MoRAL combines the multi-tasking abilities of MoE with thefine-tuning abilities of LoRA for effective life-long learning of LLMs. Incontrast to the conventional approaches that use factual triplets as inputsMoRAL relies on simple question-answer pairs, which is a more practical andeffective strategy for robust and efficient learning. Owing to new datasettings, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark namely: Life Long Learning ofLLM (5L-bench) encompassing a newly curated dataset of question-answer pairs,and a set of evaluation metrics for rigorous evaluation of MoRAL in open-bookand closed-book settings. Experimental evaluation shows (i) LLMs learn fast inopen-book settings with up to 30.15% improvement in "RA" for Phi-2-2.7Bcompared to closed-book (for models fine-tuned with MoRAL); (ii) MoRAL showshigher performance improvement for models with a greater number of parameters;(iii) MoRAL is robust to catastrophic forgetting offering better knowledgeretention compared to baselines.</description><author>Shu Yang, Muhammad Asif Ali, Cheng-Long Wang, Lijie Hu, Di Wang</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2024 12:25:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11260v1</guid></item><item><title>ScreenAI: A Vision-Language Model for UI and Infographics Understanding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04615v2</link><description>Screen user interfaces (UIs) and infographics, sharing similar visuallanguage and design principles, play important roles in human communication andhuman-machine interaction.

The standard recipe for doingso involves continued pre-training on new documents followed byinstruction-tuning on question-answer (QA) pairs. However, we find that LLMstrained with this recipe struggle to answer questions, even though theperplexity of documents is minimized. We found that QA pairs are generallystraightforward, while documents are more complex, weaving many factualstatements together in an intricate manner. Therefore, we hypothesize that itis beneficial to expose LLMs to QA pairs before continued pre-training ondocuments so that the process of encoding knowledge from complex documentstakes into account how this knowledge is accessed through questions. Based onthis, we propose pre-instruction-tuning (PIT), a method that instruction-tuneson questions prior to training on documents. This contrasts with standardinstruction-tuning, which learns how to extract knowledge after training ondocuments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that PITsignificantly enhances the ability of LLMs to absorb knowledge from newdocuments, outperforming standard instruction-tuning by 17.8%.</description><author>Zhengbao Jiang, Zhiqing Sun, Weijia Shi, Pedro Rodriguez, Chunting Zhou, Graham Neubig, Xi Victoria Lin, Wen-tau Yih, Srinivasan Iyer</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 09:20:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12847v1</guid></item><item><title>Artifacts or Abduction: How Do LLMs Answer Multiple-Choice Questions Without the Question?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12483v1</link><description>Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is often used to evaluate largelanguage models (LLMs). To see if MCQA assesses LLMs as intended, we probe ifLLMs can perform MCQA with choices-only prompts, where models must select thecorrect answer only from the choices. In three MCQA datasets and four LLMs,this prompt bests a majority baseline in 11/12 cases, with up to 0.33 accuracygain. To help explain this behavior, we conduct an in-depth, black-box analysison memorization, choice dynamics, and question inference. Our key findings arethreefold. First, we find no evidence that the choices-only accuracy stems frommemorization alone. Second, priors over individual choices do not fully explainchoices-only accuracy, hinting that LLMs use the group dynamics of choices.Third, LLMs have some ability to infer a relevant question from choices, andsurprisingly can sometimes even match the original question.

To resolve this problem, previous work hascollected interaction trajectories between GPT-4 and environments, andfine-tuned smaller models with them. As part of this, the standard approach hasbeen to simply discard trajectories that do not finish the task successfully,which, on the one hand, leads to a significant waste of data and resources, andon the other hand, has the potential to limit the possible optimization pathsduring fine-tuning.

In this paper, we aim at answering twointriguing questions: (1) Can we go beyond the KL-based objective? (2) Besidesthe popular cosine similarity, can we design a better similarity function? Weprovide answers to both questions by generalizing the KL-based mutualinformation to the $f$-Mutual Information in Contrastive Learning ($f$-MICL)using the $f$-divergences. To answer the first question, we provide a widerange of $f$-MICL objectives which share the nice properties of InfoNCE (e.g.,alignment and uniformity), and meanwhile result in similar or even superiorperformance. For the second question, assuming that the joint featuredistribution is proportional to the Gaussian kernel, we derive an $f$-Gaussiansimilarity with better interpretability and empirical performance. Finally, weidentify close relationships between the $f$-MICL objective and several popularInfoNCE-based objectives. Using benchmark tasks from both vision and naturallanguage, we empirically evaluate $f$-MICL with different $f$-divergences onvarious architectures (SimCLR, MoCo, and MoCo v3) and datasets.

However, when faced with ambiguous queries they can actunpredictably and produce incorrect outputs. This underscores the need for thedevelopment of intelligent agents capable of asking clarification questions toresolve ambiguities effectively. This capability requires complexunderstanding, state tracking, reasoning and planning over multipleconversational turns. However, directly measuring this can be challenging. Inthis paper, we offer a surrogate problem which assesses an LLMs's capability todeduce an entity unknown to itself, but revealed to a judge, by asking thejudge a series of queries. This \textit{entity-deducing game} can serve as anevaluation framework to probe the conversational reasoning and planningcapabilities of language models. We systematically evaluate various LLMs anddiscover significant differences in their performance on this task. We findthat strong LLMs like GPT-4 outperform human players by a large margin. Wefurther employ Behavior Cloning (BC) to examine whether a weaker model iscapable of imitating a stronger model and generalizing to data or domains,using only the demonstrations from a stronger model.

Retrieval-augmentedgeneration (RAG) is a promising solution and has been widely adopted. However,a RAG system can involve multiple flexible components, and there is a lack ofbest practices regarding the optimal RAG setting for various medical purposes.To systematically evaluate such systems, we propose the Medical InformationRetrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation (MIRAGE), a first-of-its-kindbenchmark including 7,663 questions from five medical QA datasets. UsingMIRAGE, we conducted large-scale experiments with over 1.8 trillion prompttokens on 41 combinations of different corpora, retrievers, and backbone LLMsthrough the MedRAG toolkit introduced in this work. Overall, MedRAG improvesthe accuracy of six different LLMs by up to 18% over chain-of-thoughtprompting, elevating the performance of GPT-3.5 and Mixtral to GPT-4-level. Ourresults show that the combination of various medical corpora and retrieversachieves the best performance. In addition, we discovered a log-linear scalingproperty and the "lost-in-the-middle" effects in medical RAG. We believe ourcomprehensive evaluations can serve as practical guidelines for implementingRAG systems for medicine.</description><author>Guangzhi Xiong, Qiao Jin, Zhiyong Lu, Aidong Zhang</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 17:44:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13178v1</guid></item><item><title>CRUD-RAG: A Comprehensive Chinese Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17043v2</link><description>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances thecapabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating externalknowledge sources. This method addresses common LLM limitations, includingoutdated information and the tendency to produce inaccurate "hallucinated"content. However, the evaluation of RAG systems is challenging, as existingbenchmarks are limited in scope and diversity. Most of the current benchmarkspredominantly assess question-answering applications, overlooking the broaderspectrum of situations where RAG could prove advantageous. Moreover, they onlyevaluate the performance of the LLM component of the RAG pipeline in theexperiments, and neglect the influence of the retrieval component and theexternal knowledge database. To address these issues, this paper constructs alarge-scale and more comprehensive benchmark, and evaluates all the componentsof RAG systems in various RAG application scenarios. Specifically, we havecategorized the range of RAG applications into four distinct types-Create,Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD), each representing a unique use case. "Create"refers to scenarios requiring the generation of original, varied content."Read" involves responding to intricate questions in knowledge-intensivesituations. "Update" focuses on revising and rectifying inaccuracies orinconsistencies in pre-existing texts. "Delete" pertains to the task ofsummarizing extensive texts into more concise forms. For each of these CRUDcategories, we have developed comprehensive datasets to evaluate theperformance of RAG systems. We also analyze the effects of various componentsof the RAG system, such as the retriever, the context length, the knowledgebase construction, and the LLM. Finally, we provide useful insights foroptimizing the RAG technology for different scenarios.</description><author>Yuanjie Lyu, Zhiyu Li, Simin Niu, Feiyu Xiong, Bo Tang, Wenjin Wang, Hao Wu, Huanyong Liu, Tong Xu, Enhong Chen, Yi Luo, Peng Cheng, Haiying Deng, Zhonghao Wang, Zijia Lu</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2024 03:14:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17043v2</guid></item><item><title>Do LLMs Implicitly Determine the Suitable Text Difficulty for Users?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14453v1</link><description>Education that suits the individual learning level is necessary to improvestudents' understanding.

The presence of such relevant informationin the visual input is typically assumed in training and testing. Thisassumption, however, is inherently flawed when dealing with imperfect imagerepresentations common in large-scale VQA, where the information carried byvisual features frequently deviates from expected ground-truth contents. As aresult, training and testing of VG-methods is performed with largely inaccuratedata, which obstructs proper assessment of their potential benefits. In thisstudy, we demonstrate that current evaluation schemes for VG-methods areproblematic due to the flawed assumption of availability of relevant visualinformation.

However, their potential in themedical domain remains largely unexplored. A significant challenge arises fromthe scarcity of diverse medical images spanning various modalities andanatomical regions, which is essential in real-world medical applications. Tosolve this problem, in this paper, we introduce OmniMedVQA, a novelcomprehensive medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark. This benchmarkis collected from 75 different medical datasets, including 12 differentmodalities and covering more than 20 distinct anatomical regions. Importantly,all images in this benchmark are sourced from authentic medical scenarios,ensuring alignment with the requirements of the medical field and suitabilityfor evaluating LVLMs. Through our extensive experiments, we have found thatexisting LVLMs struggle to address these medical VQA problems effectively.Moreover, what surprises us is that medical-specialized LVLMs even exhibitinferior performance to those general-domain models, calling for a moreversatile and robust LVLM in the biomedical field. The evaluation results notonly reveal the current limitations of LVLM in understanding real medicalimages but also highlight our dataset's significance.

Asdefense mechanisms evolve, directly obtaining harmful information becomesincreasingly challenging for Jailbreaking attacks. In this work, inspired byhuman practices of indirect context to elicit harmful information, we focus ona new attack form called Contextual Interaction Attack. The idea relies on theautoregressive nature of the generation process in LLMs. We contend that theprior context--the information preceding the attack query--plays a pivotal rolein enabling potent Jailbreaking attacks. Specifically, we propose an approachthat leverages preliminary question-answer pairs to interact with the LLM. Bydoing so, we guide the responses of the model toward revealing the 'desired'harmful information. We conduct experiments on four different LLMs anddemonstrate the efficacy of this attack, which is black-box and can alsotransfer across LLMs. We believe this can lead to further developments andunderstanding of the context vector in LLMs.</description><author>Yixin Cheng, Markos Georgopoulos, Volkan Cevher, Grigorios G.

Yet, LLMs are prone to highlight the mostfrequently seen pieces of information from the training set and to neglect therare ones. In the field of biomedical research, latest discoveries are key toacademic and industrial actors and are obscured by the abundance of anever-increasing literature corpus (the information overload problem). Surfacingnew associations between biomedical entities, e.g., drugs, genes, diseases,with LLMs becomes a challenge of capturing the long-tail knowledge of thebiomedical scientific production. To overcome this challenge, RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to alleviate some of theshortcomings of LLMs by augmenting the prompts with context retrieved fromexternal datasets. RAG methods typically select the context via maximumsimilarity search over text embeddings. In this study, we show that RAG methodsleave out a significant proportion of relevant information due to clusters ofover-represented concepts in the biomedical literature. We introduce a novelinformation-retrieval method that leverages a knowledge graph to downsamplethese clusters and mitigate the information overload problem. Its retrievalperformance is about twice better than embedding similarity alternatives onboth precision and recall. Finally, we demonstrate that both embeddingsimilarity and knowledge graph retrieval methods can be advantageously combinedinto a hybrid model that outperforms both, enabling potential improvements tobiomedical question-answering models.</description><author>Julien Delile, Srayanta Mukherjee, Anton Van Pamel, Leonid Zhukov</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2024 18:31:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12352v1</guid></item><item><title>Survey of Hallucination in Natural Language Generation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03629v6</link><description>Natural Language Generation (NLG) has improved exponentially in recent yearsthanks to the development of sequence-to-sequence deep learning technologiessuch as Transformer-based language models.

These users are often interested in data-centric tasks, such asspreadsheet manipulation and data wrangling, which are hard to solve if theintent is only communicated using a natural-language description, withoutincluding the data. But how do we decide how much data and which data toinclude in the prompt? This paper makes two contributions towards answeringthis question. First, we create a dataset of real-world NL-to-code tasksmanipulating tabular data, mined from StackOverflow posts. Second, we introducea cluster-then-select prompting technique, which adds the most representativerows from the input data to the LLM prompt. Our experiments show that LLMperformance is indeed sensitive to the amount of data passed in the prompt, andthat for tasks with a lot of syntactic variation in the input table, ourcluster-then-select technique outperforms a random selection baseline.</description><author>Shraddha Barke, Christian Poelitz, Carina Suzana Negreanu, Benjamin Zorn, José Cambronero, Andrew D.

However, LLMswith long context windows have been notorious for their expensive trainingcosts and high inference latency. Even the most advanced models such as GPT-4and Claude2 often make mistakes when processing inputs of over $100k$ tokens, aphenomenon also known as \textit{lost in the middle}. In this paper, we propose\textsc{LongAgent}, a method based on multi-agent collaboration, which scalesLLMs (e.g., LLaMA) to a context of 128K and demonstrates potential superiorityin long-text processing compared to GPT-4. In \textsc{LongAgent}, a leader isresponsible for understanding user intent and directing team members to acquireinformation from documents. Due to members' hallucinations, it is non-trivialfor a leader to obtain accurate information from the responses of dozens tohundreds of members. To address this, we develop an \textit{inter-membercommunication} mechanism to resolve response conflicts caused by hallucinationsthrough information sharing. Our experimental results indicate that\textsc{LongAgent} offers a promising alternative for long-text processing. Theagent team instantiated with LLaMA-7B achieves significant improvements intasks such as 128k-long text retrieval, multi-hop question answering, comparedto GPT-4.</description><author>Jun Zhao, Can Zu, Hao Xu, Yi Lu, Wei He, Yiwen Ding, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2024 11:46:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11550v1</guid></item><item><title>Counter-intuitive: Large Language Models Can Better Understand Knowledge Graphs Than We Thought</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11541v1</link><description>Although the method of enhancing large language models' (LLMs') reasoningability and reducing their hallucinations through the use of knowledge graphs(KGs) has received widespread attention, the exploration of how to enable LLMsto integrate the structured knowledge in KGs on-the-fly remains inadequate.Researchers often co-train KG embeddings and LLM parameters to equip LLMs withthe ability of comprehending KG knowledge. However, this resource-hungrytraining paradigm significantly increases the model learning cost and is alsounsuitable for non-open-source, black-box LLMs. In this paper, we employcomplex question answering (CQA) as a task to assess the LLM's ability ofcomprehending KG knowledge. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of KGknowledge injection methods (from triples to natural language text), aiming toexplore the optimal prompting method for supplying KG knowledge to LLMs,thereby enhancing their comprehension of KG. Contrary to our initialexpectations, our analysis revealed that LLMs effectively handle messy, noisy,and linearized KG knowledge, outperforming methods that employ well-designednatural language (NL) textual prompts.

To achieve this goal, were-examine existing detection approaches based on the self-consistency of LMsand uncover two types of hallucinations resulting from 1) question-level and 2)model-level, which cannot be effectively identified through self-consistencycheck alone. Building upon this discovery, we propose a novel sampling-basedmethod, i.e., semantic-aware cross-check consistency (SAC3) that expands on theprinciple of self-consistency checking. Our SAC3 approach incorporatesadditional mechanisms to detect both question-level and model-levelhallucinations by leveraging advances including semantically equivalentquestion perturbation and cross-model response consistency checking. Throughextensive and systematic empirical analysis, we demonstrate that SAC3outperforms the state of the art in detecting both non-factual and factualstatements across multiple question-answering and open-domain generationbenchmarks.</description><author>Jiaxin Zhang, Zhuohang Li, Kamalika Das, Bradley A.

Our analysis reveals thatone major weakness of current KG-based explanation methodologies lies inoverlooking the faithfulness of path decoding during evaluation. This oversightleads to the distribution of the graph encoder often diverging from theoriginal model predictions. To address this gap, we present two maincontributions: (1) We propose and validate Text-GNN Fidelity in this specificcontext, to assess the reliability of the graph representation. (2) Weintroduce TeGDA (Text-Graph Distribution-aware Alignment), a novel algorithmthat aligns the graph encoder with the target model to improve the faithfulnessof subsequent explanations and that can be easily integrated into existingapproaches. Our experiments and analysis show its potential to produce morefaithful systems.

Existing studiesfind VH instances only in existing image datasets, which results in biasedunderstanding of MLLMs' performance under VH due to limited diversity of suchVH instances. In this work, we propose a tool called VHTest to generate adiverse set of VH instances. Specifically, VHTest finds some initial VHinstances in existing image datasets (e.g., COCO), generates a text descriptionfor each VH mode, and uses a text-to-image generative model (e.g., DALL-E-3) togenerate VH images based on the text descriptions. We collect a benchmarkdataset with 1,200 VH instances in 8 VH modes using VHTest. We find thatexisting MLLMs such as GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MiniGPT-v2 hallucinate for alarge fraction of the instances in our benchmark. Moreover, we find thatfine-tuning an MLLM using our benchmark dataset reduces its likelihood tohallucinate without sacrificing its performance on other benchmarks.

While the idea is less explored in the graphdomain, despite the availability of numerous powerful graph models (GMs), theyare restricted to tasks in a pre-defined form. Although several methodsapplying LLMs to graphs have been proposed, they fail to simultaneously handlethe pre-defined and open-ended tasks, with LLM as a node feature enhancer or asa standalone predictor. To break this dilemma, we propose to bridge thepretrained GM and LLM by a Translator, named GraphTranslator, aiming toleverage GM to handle the pre-defined tasks effectively and utilize theextended interface of LLMs to offer various open-ended tasks for GM. To trainsuch Translator, we propose a Producer capable of constructing the graph-textalignment data along node information, neighbor information and modelinformation. By treating the node representation as a type of language, theproposed GraphTranslator empowers an LLM to make predictions based on noderepresentation and language instructions, providing a unified perspective forboth pre-defined and open-ended tasks. Extensive results show that the proposedGraphTranslator effectively improves the results of zero-shot nodeclassification.

Recent advancements have extendedtheir capabilities to handle long-input contexts, exceeding 100k tokens.However, in question answering, language models exhibit uneven utilization oftheir input context. They tend to favor the initial and final segments,resulting in a U-shaped performance pattern concerning where the answer islocated within the input. This bias raises concerns, particularly insummarization where crucial content may be dispersed throughout the sourcedocument(s). Besides, in summarization, mapping facts from the source to thesummary is not trivial as salient content is usually re-phrased. In this paper,we conduct the first comprehensive study on context utilization and positionbias in summarization. Our analysis encompasses 5 LLMs, 10 datasets, and 5evaluation metrics. We introduce a new evaluation benchmark called MiddleSum onthe which we benchmark two alternative inference methods to alleviate positionbias: hierarchical summarization and incremental summarization.</description><author>Mathieu Ravaut, Aixin Sun, Nancy F.

Unlike these models, humans typically utilize external tools tocross-check and refine their initial content, like using a search engine forfact-checking, or a code interpreter for debugging. Inspired by thisobservation, we introduce a framework called CRITIC that allows LLMs, which areessentially "black boxes" to validate and progressively amend their own outputsin a manner similar to human interaction with tools. More specifically,starting with an initial output, CRITIC interacts with appropriate tools toevaluate certain aspects of the text, and then revises the output based on thefeedback obtained during this validation process. Comprehensive evaluationsinvolving free-form question answering, mathematical program synthesis, andtoxicity reduction demonstrate that CRITIC consistently enhances theperformance of LLMs. Meanwhile, our research highlights the crucial importanceof external feedback in promoting the ongoing self-improvement of LLMs.</description><author>Zhibin Gou, Zhihong Shao, Yeyun Gong, Yelong Shen, Yujiu Yang, Nan Duan, Weizhu Chen</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2024 12:59:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11738v4</guid></item></channel></rss>

While small models are computationallyefficient, their capacity is much limited compared with large models. To breakthis trade-off, this paper builds a small emotional vision language model(SEVLM) by emotion modeling and input-output feature alignment. On the onehand, based on valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) knowledge annotated bypsychology experts, we introduce and fuse emotional features derived throughVAD dictionary and a VAD head to align VAD vectors of predicted emotionexplanation and the ground truth. This allows the vision language model tobetter understand and generate emotional texts, compared with using traditionaltext embeddings alone. On the other hand, we design a contrastive head to pullclose embeddings of the image, its emotion class, and explanation, which alignsmodel outputs and inputs. On two public affective explanation datasets, we showthat the proposed techniques consistently improve the visual art understandingperformance of baseline SEVLMs. Importantly, the proposed model can be trainedand evaluated on a single RTX 2080 Ti while exhibiting very strong performance:it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art small models but is alsocompetitive compared with LLaVA 7B after fine-tuning and GPT4(V).

In particular, we apply this approach to build CUBE(CUltural BEnchmark for Text-to-Image models), a first-of-its-kind benchmark toevaluate cultural competence of T2I models. CUBE covers cultural artifactsassociated with 8 countries across different geo-cultural regions and along 3concepts: cuisine, landmarks, and art. CUBE consists of 1) CUBE-1K, a set ofhigh-quality prompts that enable the evaluation of cultural awareness, and 2)CUBE-CSpace, a larger dataset of cultural artifacts that serves as grounding toevaluate cultural diversity. We also introduce cultural diversity as a novelT2I evaluation component, leveraging quality-weighted Vendi score. Ourevaluations reveal significant gaps in the cultural awareness of existingmodels across countries and provide valuable insights into the culturaldiversity of T2I outputs for under-specified prompts. Our methodology isextendable to other cultural regions and concepts, and can facilitate thedevelopment of T2I models that better cater to the global population.</description><author>Nithish Kannen, Arif Ahmad, Marco Andreetto, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran, Utsav Prabhu, Adji Bousso Dieng, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Shachi Dave</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 17:57:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06863v2</guid></item><item><title>Robotic Control via Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08693v1</link><description>A key limitation of learned robot control policies is their inability togeneralize outside their training data. Recent works on vision-language-actionmodels (VLAs) have shown that the use of large, internet pre-trainedvision-language models as the backbone of learned robot policies cansubstantially improve their robustness and generalization ability. Yet, one ofthe most exciting capabilities of large vision-language models in other domainsis their ability to reason iteratively through complex problems. Can that samecapability be brought into robotics to allow policies to improve performance byreasoning about a given task before acting? Naive use of "chain-of-thought"(CoT) style prompting is significantly less effective with standard VLAsbecause of the relatively simple training examples that are available to them.Additionally, purely semantic reasoning about sub-tasks, as is common inregular CoT, is insufficient for robot policies that need to ground theirreasoning in sensory observations and the robot state. To this end, weintroduce Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (ECoT) for VLAs, in which wetrain VLAs to perform multiple steps of reasoning about plans, sub-tasks,motions, and visually grounded features like object bounding boxes and endeffector positions, before predicting the robot action. We design a scalablepipeline for generating synthetic training data for ECoT on large robotdatasets. We demonstrate, that ECoT increases the absolute success rate ofOpenVLA, the current strongest open-source VLA policy, by 28% acrosschallenging generalization tasks, without any additional robot training data.Additionally, ECoT makes it easier for humans to interpret a policy's failuresand correct its behavior using natural language.</description><author>Zawalski Michał, Chen William, Pertsch Karl, Mees Oier, Finn Chelsea, Levine Sergey</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 17:31:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08693v1</guid></item><item><title>ShapeLLM: Universal 3D Object Understanding for Embodied Interaction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17766v3</link><description>This paper presents ShapeLLM, the first 3D Multimodal Large Language Model(LLM) designed for embodied interaction, exploring a universal 3D objectunderstanding with 3D point clouds and languages.

A promising approach towards this means is tobuild dialog tutoring models that scaffold students' problem-solving. However,even though existing LLMs perform well in solving reasoning questions, theystruggle to precisely detect student's errors and tailor their feedback tothese errors. Inspired by real-world teaching practice where teachers identifystudent errors and customize their response based on them, we focus onverifying student solutions and show how grounding to such verificationimproves the overall quality of tutor response generation. We collect a datasetof 1K stepwise math reasoning chains with the first error step annotated byteachers. We show empirically that finding the mistake in a student solution ischallenging for current models. We propose and evaluate several verifiers fordetecting these errors. Using both automatic and human evaluation we show thatthe student solution verifiers steer the generation model towards highlytargeted responses to student errors which are more often correct with lesshallucinations compared to existing baselines.</description><author>Nico Daheim, Jakub Macina, Manu Kapur, Iryna Gurevych, Mrinmaya Sachan</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 10:11:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09136v1</guid></item><item><title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14608v6</link><description>Large models represent a groundbreaking advancement in multiple applicationfields, enabling remarkable achievements across various tasks. However, theirunprecedented scale comes with significant computational costs. These models,often consisting of billions of parameters, require vast amounts ofcomputational resources for execution. Especially, the expansive scale andcomputational demands pose considerable challenges when customizing them forparticular downstream tasks, particularly over the hardware platformsconstrained by computational capabilities. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) provides a practical solution by efficiently adjusting the large modelsover the various downstream tasks. In particular, PEFT refers to the process ofadjusting the parameters of a pre-trained large models to adapt it to aspecific task or domain while minimizing the number of additional parametersintroduced or computational resources required. This approach is particularlyimportant when dealing with large-scale language models with high parametercounts, as fine-tuning these models from scratch can be computationallyexpensive and resource-intensive, posing considerable challenges in thesupporting system platform design. In this survey, we present comprehensivestudies of various PEFT algorithms, examining their performance andcomputational overhead. Moreover, we provide an overview of applicationsdeveloped using different PEFT algorithms and discuss common techniquesemployed to mitigate computation costs for PEFT. In addition to providing anextensive survey from an algorithmic standpoint, we also examine variousreal-world system designs to investigate the implementation costs associatedwith different PEFT approaches.

Toimprove upon this status quo, this paper introduces ASTrust, aninterpretability method for LLMs of code that generates explanations groundedin the relationship between model confidence and syntactic structures ofprogramming languages. ASTrust explains generated code in the context of syntaxcategories based on Abstract Syntax Trees and aids practitioners inunderstanding model predictions at both local (individual code snippets) andglobal (larger datasets of code) levels. By distributing and assigning modelconfidence scores to well-known syntactic structures that exist within ASTs,our approach moves beyond prior techniques that perform token-level confidencemapping by offering a view of model confidence that directly aligns withprogramming language concepts with which developers are familiar. To putASTrust into practice, we developed an automated visualization that illustratesthe aggregated model confidence scores superimposed on sequence, heat-map, andgraph-based visuals of syntactic structures from ASTs. We examine both thepractical benefit that ASTrust can provide through a data science study on 12popular LLMs on a curated set of GitHub repos and the usefulness of ASTrustthrough a human study.</description><author>David N.

Measuring value alignment ofLLMs becomes crucial for their regulation and responsible deployment. Numerousdatasets have been constructed to assess social bias, toxicity, and ethics inLLMs, but they suffer from evaluation chronoeffect, that is, as models rapidlyevolve, existing data becomes leaked or undemanding, overestimatingever-developing LLMs. To tackle this problem, we propose GETA, a novelgenerative evolving testing approach that dynamically probes the underlyingmoral baselines of LLMs. Distinct from previous adaptive testing methods thatrely on static datasets with limited difficulty, GETA incorporates aniteratively-updated item generator which infers each LLM's moral boundaries andgenerates difficulty-tailored testing items, accurately reflecting the truealignment extent. This process theoretically learns a joint distribution ofitem and model response, with item difficulty and value conformity as latentvariables, where the generator co-evolves with the LLM, addressingchronoeffect. We evaluate various popular LLMs with diverse capabilities anddemonstrate that GETA can create difficulty-matching testing items and moreaccurately assess LLMs' values, better consistent with their performance onunseen OOD and i.i.d. items, laying the groundwork for future evaluationparadigms.</description><author>Han Jiang, Xiaoyuan Yi, Zhihua Wei, Shu Wang, Xing Xie</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 03:47:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14230v2</guid></item><item><title>Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08940v1</link><description>The rapid growth of biomedical knowledge has outpaced our ability toefficiently extract insights and generate novel hypotheses. Large languagemodels (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool to revolutionize knowledgeinteraction and potentially accelerate biomedical discovery. In this paper, wepresent a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs as biomedical hypothesis generators.We construct a dataset of background-hypothesis pairs from biomedicalliterature, carefully partitioned into training, seen, and unseen test setsbased on publication date to mitigate data contamination. Using this dataset,we assess the hypothesis generation capabilities of top-tier instructed modelsin zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. To enhance the exploration ofuncertainty, a crucial aspect of scientific discovery, we incorporate tool useand multi-agent interactions in our evaluation framework. Furthermore, wepropose four novel metrics grounded in extensive literature review to evaluatethe quality of generated hypotheses, considering both LLM-based and humanassessments. Our experiments yield two key findings: 1) LLMs can generate noveland validated hypotheses, even when tested on literature unseen duringtraining, and 2) Increasing uncertainty through multi-agent interactions andtool use can facilitate diverse candidate generation and improve zero-shothypothesis generation performance. However, we also observe that theintegration of additional knowledge through few-shot learning and tool use maynot always lead to performance gains, highlighting the need for carefulconsideration of the type and scope of external knowledge incorporated.

Medicine's inherently multimodal nature incorporating scans andtext-based medical histories to write reports makes it conducive to benefitfrom these leaps in AI capabilities. We evaluate the publicly available, stateof the art, foundational vision-language models for chest X-ray interpretationacross several datasets and benchmarks. We use linear probes to evaluate theperformance of various components including CheXagent's vision transformer andQ-former, which outperform the industry-standard Torch X-ray Vision modelsacross many different datasets showing robust generalisation capabilities.Importantly, we find that vision-language models often hallucinate withconfident language, which slows down clinical interpretation. Based on thesefindings, we develop an agent-based vision-language approach for reportgeneration using CheXagent's linear probes and BioViL-T's phrase groundingtools to generate uncertainty-aware radiology reports with pathologieslocalised and described based on their likelihood.

The compositionalnature of natural language enables the localization beyond predefined events,posing a certain challenge to the compositional generalizability of existingmethods. Recent studies establish the correspondence between videos and queriesthrough a decompose-reconstruct manner to achieve compositional generalization.However, they only consider dominant primitives and build negative queriesthrough random sampling and recombination, resulting in semanticallyimplausible negatives that hinder the models from learning rationalcompositions. In addition, recent DETR-based methods still underperform incompositional temporal grounding, showing irrational saliency responses whengiven negative queries that have subtle differences from positive queries. Toaddress these limitations, we first propose a large language model-drivenmethod for negative query construction, utilizing GPT-3.5-Turbo to generatesemantically plausible hard negative queries. Subsequently, we introduce acoarse-to-fine saliency ranking strategy, which encourages the model to learnthe multi-granularity semantic relationships between videos and hierarchicalnegative queries to boost compositional generalization.

Recently, 2Dvision-language models such as CLIP have been widely popularized, due to theirimpressive capabilities for open-vocabulary grounding in 2D images. Recentworks aim to elevate 2D CLIP features to 3D via feature distillation, buteither learn neural fields that are scene-specific and hence lackgeneralization, or focus on indoor room scan data that require access tomultiple camera views, which is not practical in robot manipulation scenarios.Additionally, related methods typically fuse features at pixel-level and assumethat all camera views are equally informative. In this work, we show that thisapproach leads to sub-optimal 3D features, both in terms of grounding accuracy,as well as segmentation crispness. To alleviate this, we propose a multi-viewfeature fusion strategy that employs object-centric priors to eliminateuninformative views based on semantic information, and fuse features atobject-level via instance segmentation masks. To distill our object-centric 3Dfeatures, we generate a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset of clutteredtabletop scenes, spawning 15k scenes from over 3300 unique object instances,which we make publicly available. We show that our method reconstructs 3D CLIPfeatures with improved grounding capacity and spatial consistency, while doingso from single-view RGB-D, thus departing from the assumption of multiplecamera views at test time. Finally, we show that our approach can generalize tonovel tabletop domains and be re-purposed for 3D instance segmentation withoutfine-tuning, and demonstrate its utility for language-guided robotic graspingin clutter</description><author>Georgios Tziafas, Yucheng Xu, Zhibin Li, Hamidreza Kasaei</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 14:23:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18742v3</guid></item><item><title>Towards Open-World Grasping with Large Vision-Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18722v3</link><description>The ability to grasp objects in-the-wild from open-ended languageinstructions constitutes a fundamental challenge in robotics. An open-worldgrasping system should be able to combine high-level contextual with low-levelphysical-geometric reasoning in order to be applicable in arbitrary scenarios.Recent works exploit the web-scale knowledge inherent in large language models(LLMs) to plan and reason in robotic context, but rely on external vision andaction models to ground such knowledge into the environment and parameterizeactuation. This setup suffers from two major bottlenecks: a) the LLM'sreasoning capacity is constrained by the quality of visual grounding, and b)LLMs do not contain low-level spatial understanding of the world, which isessential for grasping in contact-rich scenarios. In this work we demonstratethat modern vision-language models (VLMs) are capable of tackling suchlimitations, as they are implicitly grounded and can jointly reason aboutsemantics and geometry. We propose OWG, an open-world grasping pipeline thatcombines VLMs with segmentation and grasp synthesis models to unlock groundedworld understanding in three stages: open-ended referring segmentation,grounded grasp planning and grasp ranking via contact reasoning, all of whichcan be applied zero-shot via suitable visual prompting mechanisms. We conductextensive evaluation in cluttered indoor scene datasets to showcase OWG'srobustness in grounding from open-ended language, as well as open-world roboticgrasping experiments in both simulation and hardware that demonstrate superiorperformance compared to previous supervised and zero-shot LLM-based methods.</description><author>Georgios Tziafas, Hamidreza Kasaei</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 14:21:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18722v3</guid></item><item><title>Large Language Models and Games: A Survey and Roadmap</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18659v2</link><description>Recent years have seen an explosive increase in research on large languagemodels (LLMs), and accompanying public engagement on the topic.

Large languagemodels (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool to revolutionize knowledgeinteraction and potentially accelerate biomedical discovery. In this paper, wepresent a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs as biomedical hypothesis generators.We construct a dataset of background-hypothesis pairs from biomedicalliterature, carefully partitioned into training, seen, and unseen test setsbased on publication date to mitigate data contamination. Using this dataset,we assess the hypothesis generation capabilities of top-tier instructed modelsin zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. To enhance the exploration ofuncertainty, a crucial aspect of scientific discovery, we incorporate tool useand multi-agent interactions in our evaluation framework. Furthermore, wepropose four novel metrics grounded in extensive literature review to evaluatethe quality of generated hypotheses, considering both LLM-based and humanassessments. Our experiments yield two key findings: 1) LLMs can generate noveland validated hypotheses, even when tested on literature unseen duringtraining, and 2) Increasing uncertainty through multi-agent interactions andtool use can facilitate diverse candidate generation and improve zero-shothypothesis generation performance. However, we also observe that theintegration of additional knowledge through few-shot learning and tool use maynot always lead to performance gains, highlighting the need for carefulconsideration of the type and scope of external knowledge incorporated. Thesefindings underscore the potential of LLMs as powerful aids in biomedicalhypothesis generation and provide valuable insights to guide further researchin this area.</description><author>Biqing Qi, Kaiyan Zhang, Kai Tian, Haoxiang Li, Zhang-Ren Chen, Sihang Zeng, Ermo Hua, Hu Jinfang, Bowen Zhou</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 06:27:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08940v2</guid></item><item><title>By My Eyes: Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models with Sensor Data via Visual Prompting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10385v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities acrossvarious domains.

We introduce LMExplainer, a novel knowledge-groundedexplainer that clarifies the reasoning process of LMs through intuitive,human-understandable explanations. By leveraging a graph attention network(GAT) with a large-scale knowledge graph (KG), LMExplainer not only preciselynarrows the reasoning space to focus on the most relevant knowledge but alsogrounds its reasoning in structured, verifiable knowledge to reducehallucinations and enhance interpretability.

Wesimultaneously consider both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, where theformer comes from the lack of knowledge about the ground truth (such as aboutfacts or the language), and the latter comes from irreducible randomness (suchas multiple possible answers). In particular, we derive aninformation-theoretic metric that allows to reliably detect when only epistemicuncertainty is large, in which case the output of the model is unreliable. Thiscondition can be computed based solely on the output of the model obtainedsimply by some special iterative prompting based on the previous responses.Such quantification, for instance, allows to detect hallucinations (cases whenepistemic uncertainty is high) in both single- and multi-answer responses. Thisis in contrast to many standard uncertainty quantification strategies (such asthresholding the log-likelihood of a response) where hallucinations in themulti-answer case cannot be detected. We conduct a series of experiments whichdemonstrate the advantage of our formulation. Further, our investigations shedsome light on how the probabilities assigned to a given output by an LLM can beamplified by iterative prompting, which might be of independent interest.</description><author>Yasin Abbasi Yadkori, Ilja Kuzborskij, András György, Csaba Szepesvári</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2024 15:55:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02543v2</guid></item><item><title>Instruction-Driven Game Engines on Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00276v3</link><description>The Instruction-Driven Game Engine (IDGE) project aims to democratize gamedevelopment by enabling a large language model (LLM) to follow free-form gamerules and autonomously generate game-play processes.

Current agent frameworks often suffer fromdependencies on single-agent execution and lack robust inter-modulecommunication, frequently leading to suboptimal multi-agent reinforcementlearning (MARL) policies and inadequate task coordination. To address thesechallenges, we present a framework for training large language models (LLMs) ascollaborative agents to enable coordinated behaviors in cooperative MARL. Eachagent maintains a private intention consisting of its current goal andassociated sub-tasks. Agents broadcast their intentions periodically, allowingother agents to infer coordination tasks. A propagation network transformsbroadcast intentions into teammate-specific communication messages, sharingrelevant goals with designated teammates. The architecture of our framework isstructured into planning, grounding, and execution modules. During execution,multiple agents interact in a downstream environment and communicate intentionsto enable coordinated behaviors. The grounding module dynamically adaptscomprehension strategies based on emerging coordination patterns, whilefeedback from execution agents influnces the planning module, enabling thedynamic re-planning of sub-tasks. Results in collaborative environmentsimulation demonstrate intention propagation reduces miscoordination errors byaligning sub-task dependencies between agents. Agents learn when to communicateintentions and which teammates require task details, resulting in emergentcoordinated behaviors. This demonstrates the efficacy of intention sharing forcooperative multi-agent RL based on LLMs.</description><author>Xihe Qiu, Haoyu Wang, Xiaoyu Tan, Chao Qu, Yujie Xiong, Yuan Cheng, Yinghui Xu, Wei Chu, Yuan Qi</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2024 13:14:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12532v1</guid></item><item><title>Hierarchical Indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Opinion Summarization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00435v2</link><description>We propose a method for unsupervised abstractive opinion summarization, thatcombines the attributability and scalability of extractive approaches with thecoherence and fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Addressing this, the development ofpersonality traits in LLMs emerges as a crucial area of research to unlocktheir latent potential. Existing methods to personify LLMs generally involvestrategies like employing stylized training data for instruction tuning orusing prompt engineering to simulate different personalities. These methodsonly capture superficial linguistic styles instead of the core of personalitiesand are therefore not stable. In this study, we propose PersLLM, integratingpsychology-grounded principles of personality: social practice, consistency,and dynamic development, into a comprehensive training methodology. Weincorporate personality traits directly into the model parameters, enhancingthe model's resistance to induction, promoting consistency, and supporting thedynamic evolution of personality. Single-agent evaluation validates ourmethod's superiority, as it produces responses more aligned with referencepersonalities compared to other approaches.

While these models have shown unprecedented performance in manydownstream zero-shot tasks (eg image captioning, question answers, etc), stilllittle emphasis has been put on transferring one of the core LLM capability ofIn-Context Learning (ICL). ICL is the ability of a model to reason about adownstream task with a few examples demonstrations embedded in the prompt. Inthis work, through extensive evaluations, we find that the state-of-the-artVLMs somewhat lack the ability to follow ICL instructions. In particular, wediscover that even models that underwent large-scale mixed modalitypre-training and were implicitly guided to make use of interleaved image andtext information (intended to consume helpful context from multiple images)under-perform when prompted with few-shot demonstrations (in an ICL way),likely due to their lack of direct ICL instruction tuning. To enhance the ICLabilities of the present VLM, we propose a simple yet surprisingly effectivemulti-turn curriculum-based learning methodology with effective data mixes,leading up to a significant 21.03% (and 11.3% on average) ICL performance boostover the strongest VLM baselines and a variety of ICL benchmarks.

Recent advances on large language models (LLMs)have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMscould help with misinformation detection remains relatively underexplored. Mostof existing state-of-the-art approaches either do not consider evidence andsolely focus on claim related features or assume the evidence to be provided.Few approaches consider evidence retrieval as part of the misinformationdetection but rely on fine-tuning models. In this paper, we investigate thepotential of LLMs for misinformation detection in a zero-shot setting.

To this end, we propose a novel re-ranking approach for multimodalevidence retrieval using both LLMs and large vision-language models (LVLM).

Unlike existingsolutions that typically involve costly supplementary training data or theintegration of external knowledge sources, DOPRA innovatively addresseshallucinations by decoding specific weighted layer penalties andredistribution, offering an economical and effective solution withoutadditional resources. DOPRA is grounded in unique insights into the intrinsicmechanisms controlling hallucinations within MLLMs, especially the models'tendency to over-rely on a subset of summary tokens in the self-attentionmatrix, neglecting critical image-related information. This phenomenon isparticularly pronounced in certain strata. To counteract this over-reliance,DOPRA employs a strategy of weighted overlay penalties and redistribution inspecific layers, such as the 12th layer, during the decoding process.Furthermore, DOPRA includes a retrospective allocation process that re-examinesthe sequence of generated tokens, allowing the algorithm to reallocate tokenselection to better align with the actual image content, thereby reducing theincidence of hallucinatory descriptions in auto-generated captions. Overall,DOPRA represents a significant step forward in improving the output quality ofMLLMs by systematically reducing hallucinations through targeted adjustmentsduring the decoding process.</description><author>Jinfeng Wei, Xiaofeng Zhang</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 09:30:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15130v2</guid></item><item><title>PhenoFlow: A Human-LLM Driven Visual Analytics System for Exploring Large and Complex Stroke Datasets</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16329v1</link><description>Acute stroke demands prompt diagnosis and treatment to achieve optimalpatient outcomes. However, the intricate and irregular nature of clinical dataassociated with acute stroke, particularly blood pressure (BP) measurements,presents substantial obstacles to effective visual analytics anddecision-making. Through a year-long collaboration with experiencedneurologists, we developed PhenoFlow, a visual analytics system that leveragesthe collaboration between human and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze theextensive and complex data of acute ischemic stroke patients. PhenoFlowpioneers an innovative workflow, where the LLM serves as a data wrangler whileneurologists explore and supervise the output using visualizations and naturallanguage interactions. This approach enables neurologists to focus more ondecision-making with reduced cognitive load. To protect sensitive patientinformation, PhenoFlow only utilizes metadata to make inferences and synthesizeexecutable codes, without accessing raw patient data. This ensures that theresults are both reproducible and interpretable while maintaining patientprivacy. The system incorporates a slice-and-wrap design that employs temporalfolding to create an overlaid circular visualization. Combined with a linearbar graph, this design aids in exploring meaningful patterns within irregularlymeasured BP data. Through case studies, PhenoFlow has demonstrated itscapability to support iterative analysis of extensive clinical datasets,reducing cognitive load and enabling neurologists to make well-informeddecisions. Grounded in long-term collaboration with domain experts, ourresearch demonstrates the potential of utilizing LLMs to tackle currentchallenges in data-driven clinical decision-making for acute ischemic strokepatients.</description><author>Jaeyoung Kim, Sihyeon Lee, Hyeon Jeon, Keon-Joo Lee, Hee-Joon Bae, Bohyoung Kim, Jinwook Seo</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 09:25:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16329v1</guid></item><item><title>Finetuning Generative Large Language Models with Discrimination Instructions for Knowledge Graph Completion</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16127v1</link><description>Traditional knowledge graph (KG) completion models learn embeddings topredict missing facts. Recent works attempt to complete KGs in atext-generation manner with large language models (LLMs). However, they need toground the output of LLMs to KG entities, which inevitably brings errors. Inthis paper, we present a finetuning framework, DIFT, aiming to unleash the KGcompletion ability of LLMs and avoid grounding errors. Given an incompletefact, DIFT employs a lightweight model to obtain candidate entities andfinetunes an LLM with discrimination instructions to select the correct onefrom the given candidates. To improve performance while reducing instructiondata, DIFT uses a truncated sampling method to select useful facts forfinetuning and injects KG embeddings into the LLM. Extensive experiments onbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</description><author>Yang Liu, Xiaobin Tian, Zequn Sun, Wei Hu</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 02:25:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16127v1</guid></item><item><title>Tree-Planner: Efficient Close-loop Task Planning with Large Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08582v2</link><description>This paper studies close-loop task planning, which refers to the process ofgenerating a sequence of skills (a plan) to accomplish a specific goal whileadapting the plan based on real-time observations. Recently, prompting LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) to generate actions iteratively has become a prevalentparadigm due to its superior performance and user-friendliness. However, thisparadigm is plagued by two inefficiencies: high token consumption and redundanterror correction, both of which hinder its scalability for large-scale testingand applications. To address these issues, we propose Tree-Planner, whichreframes task planning with LLMs into three distinct phases: plan sampling,action tree construction, and grounded deciding. Tree-Planner starts by usingan LLM to sample a set of potential plans before execution, followed by theaggregation of them to form an action tree. Finally, the LLM performs atop-down decision-making process on the tree, taking into account real-timeenvironmental information. Experiments show that Tree-Planner achievesstate-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency. By decomposingLLM queries into a single plan-sampling call and multiple grounded-decidingcalls, a considerable part of the prompt are less likely to be repeatedlyconsumed. As a result, token consumption is reduced by 92.2% compared to thepreviously best-performing model. Additionally, by enabling backtracking on theaction tree as needed, the correction process becomes more flexible, leading toa 40.5% decrease in error corrections.</description><author>Mengkang Hu, Yao Mu, Xinmiao Yu, Mingyu Ding, Shiguang Wu, Wenqi Shao, Qiguang Chen, Bin Wang, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 12:25:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08582v2</guid></item></channel></rss>

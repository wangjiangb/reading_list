While small models are computationallyefficient, their capacity is much limited compared with large models. To breakthis trade-off, this paper builds a small emotional vision language model(SEVLM) by emotion modeling and input-output feature alignment. On the onehand, based on valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) knowledge annotated bypsychology experts, we introduce and fuse emotional features derived throughVAD dictionary and a VAD head to align VAD vectors of predicted emotionexplanation and the ground truth. This allows the vision language model tobetter understand and generate emotional texts, compared with using traditionaltext embeddings alone. On the other hand, we design a contrastive head to pullclose embeddings of the image, its emotion class, and explanation, which alignsmodel outputs and inputs. On two public affective explanation datasets, we showthat the proposed techniques consistently improve the visual art understandingperformance of baseline SEVLMs. Importantly, the proposed model can be trainedand evaluated on a single RTX 2080 Ti while exhibiting very strong performance:it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art small models but is alsocompetitive compared with LLaVA 7B after fine-tuning and GPT4(V).

In particular, we apply this approach to build CUBE(CUltural BEnchmark for Text-to-Image models), a first-of-its-kind benchmark toevaluate cultural competence of T2I models. CUBE covers cultural artifactsassociated with 8 countries across different geo-cultural regions and along 3concepts: cuisine, landmarks, and art. CUBE consists of 1) CUBE-1K, a set ofhigh-quality prompts that enable the evaluation of cultural awareness, and 2)CUBE-CSpace, a larger dataset of cultural artifacts that serves as grounding toevaluate cultural diversity. We also introduce cultural diversity as a novelT2I evaluation component, leveraging quality-weighted Vendi score. Ourevaluations reveal significant gaps in the cultural awareness of existingmodels across countries and provide valuable insights into the culturaldiversity of T2I outputs for under-specified prompts. Our methodology isextendable to other cultural regions and concepts, and can facilitate thedevelopment of T2I models that better cater to the global population.</description><author>Nithish Kannen, Arif Ahmad, Marco Andreetto, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran, Utsav Prabhu, Adji Bousso Dieng, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Shachi Dave</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 17:57:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06863v2</guid></item><item><title>Robotic Control via Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08693v1</link><description>A key limitation of learned robot control policies is their inability togeneralize outside their training data. Recent works on vision-language-actionmodels (VLAs) have shown that the use of large, internet pre-trainedvision-language models as the backbone of learned robot policies cansubstantially improve their robustness and generalization ability. Yet, one ofthe most exciting capabilities of large vision-language models in other domainsis their ability to reason iteratively through complex problems. Can that samecapability be brought into robotics to allow policies to improve performance byreasoning about a given task before acting? Naive use of "chain-of-thought"(CoT) style prompting is significantly less effective with standard VLAsbecause of the relatively simple training examples that are available to them.Additionally, purely semantic reasoning about sub-tasks, as is common inregular CoT, is insufficient for robot policies that need to ground theirreasoning in sensory observations and the robot state. To this end, weintroduce Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (ECoT) for VLAs, in which wetrain VLAs to perform multiple steps of reasoning about plans, sub-tasks,motions, and visually grounded features like object bounding boxes and endeffector positions, before predicting the robot action. We design a scalablepipeline for generating synthetic training data for ECoT on large robotdatasets. We demonstrate, that ECoT increases the absolute success rate ofOpenVLA, the current strongest open-source VLA policy, by 28% acrosschallenging generalization tasks, without any additional robot training data.Additionally, ECoT makes it easier for humans to interpret a policy's failuresand correct its behavior using natural language.</description><author>Zawalski Michał, Chen William, Pertsch Karl, Mees Oier, Finn Chelsea, Levine Sergey</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 17:31:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08693v1</guid></item><item><title>ShapeLLM: Universal 3D Object Understanding for Embodied Interaction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17766v3</link><description>This paper presents ShapeLLM, the first 3D Multimodal Large Language Model(LLM) designed for embodied interaction, exploring a universal 3D objectunderstanding with 3D point clouds and languages.

A promising approach towards this means is tobuild dialog tutoring models that scaffold students' problem-solving. However,even though existing LLMs perform well in solving reasoning questions, theystruggle to precisely detect student's errors and tailor their feedback tothese errors. Inspired by real-world teaching practice where teachers identifystudent errors and customize their response based on them, we focus onverifying student solutions and show how grounding to such verificationimproves the overall quality of tutor response generation. We collect a datasetof 1K stepwise math reasoning chains with the first error step annotated byteachers. We show empirically that finding the mistake in a student solution ischallenging for current models. We propose and evaluate several verifiers fordetecting these errors. Using both automatic and human evaluation we show thatthe student solution verifiers steer the generation model towards highlytargeted responses to student errors which are more often correct with lesshallucinations compared to existing baselines.</description><author>Nico Daheim, Jakub Macina, Manu Kapur, Iryna Gurevych, Mrinmaya Sachan</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 10:11:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09136v1</guid></item><item><title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14608v6</link><description>Large models represent a groundbreaking advancement in multiple applicationfields, enabling remarkable achievements across various tasks. However, theirunprecedented scale comes with significant computational costs. These models,often consisting of billions of parameters, require vast amounts ofcomputational resources for execution. Especially, the expansive scale andcomputational demands pose considerable challenges when customizing them forparticular downstream tasks, particularly over the hardware platformsconstrained by computational capabilities. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) provides a practical solution by efficiently adjusting the large modelsover the various downstream tasks. In particular, PEFT refers to the process ofadjusting the parameters of a pre-trained large models to adapt it to aspecific task or domain while minimizing the number of additional parametersintroduced or computational resources required. This approach is particularlyimportant when dealing with large-scale language models with high parametercounts, as fine-tuning these models from scratch can be computationallyexpensive and resource-intensive, posing considerable challenges in thesupporting system platform design. In this survey, we present comprehensivestudies of various PEFT algorithms, examining their performance andcomputational overhead. Moreover, we provide an overview of applicationsdeveloped using different PEFT algorithms and discuss common techniquesemployed to mitigate computation costs for PEFT. In addition to providing anextensive survey from an algorithmic standpoint, we also examine variousreal-world system designs to investigate the implementation costs associatedwith different PEFT approaches. This survey serves as an indispensable resourcefor researchers aiming to understand both the PEFT algorithm and its systemimplementation, offering detailed ......</description><author>Zeyu Han, Chao Gao, Jinyang Liu, Jeff Zhang, Sai Qian Zhang</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 09:58:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14608v6</guid></item><item><title>Towards More Trustworthy and Interpretable LLMs for Code through Syntax-Grounded Explanations</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08983v1</link><description>Trustworthiness and interpretability are inextricably linked concepts forLLMs. The more interpretable an LLM is, the more trustworthy it becomes.However, current techniques for interpreting LLMs when applied to code-relatedtasks largely focus on accuracy measurements, measures of how models react tochange, or individual task performance instead of the fine-grained explanationsneeded at prediction time for greater interpretability, and hence trust. Toimprove upon this status quo, this paper introduces ASTrust, aninterpretability method for LLMs of code that generates explanations groundedin the relationship between model confidence and syntactic structures ofprogramming languages. ASTrust explains generated code in the context of syntaxcategories based on Abstract Syntax Trees and aids practitioners inunderstanding model predictions at both local (individual code snippets) andglobal (larger datasets of code) levels. By distributing and assigning modelconfidence scores to well-known syntactic structures that exist within ASTs,our approach moves beyond prior techniques that perform token-level confidencemapping by offering a view of model confidence that directly aligns withprogramming language concepts with which developers are familiar. To putASTrust into practice, we developed an automated visualization that illustratesthe aggregated model confidence scores superimposed on sequence, heat-map, andgraph-based visuals of syntactic structures from ASTs. We examine both thepractical benefit that ASTrust can provide through a data science study on 12popular LLMs on a curated set of GitHub repos and the usefulness of ASTrustthrough a human study.</description><author>David N.

Measuring value alignment ofLLMs becomes crucial for their regulation and responsible deployment. Numerousdatasets have been constructed to assess social bias, toxicity, and ethics inLLMs, but they suffer from evaluation chronoeffect, that is, as models rapidlyevolve, existing data becomes leaked or undemanding, overestimatingever-developing LLMs. To tackle this problem, we propose GETA, a novelgenerative evolving testing approach that dynamically probes the underlyingmoral baselines of LLMs. Distinct from previous adaptive testing methods thatrely on static datasets with limited difficulty, GETA incorporates aniteratively-updated item generator which infers each LLM's moral boundaries andgenerates difficulty-tailored testing items, accurately reflecting the truealignment extent. This process theoretically learns a joint distribution ofitem and model response, with item difficulty and value conformity as latentvariables, where the generator co-evolves with the LLM, addressingchronoeffect. We evaluate various popular LLMs with diverse capabilities anddemonstrate that GETA can create difficulty-matching testing items and moreaccurately assess LLMs' values, better consistent with their performance onunseen OOD and i.i.d. items, laying the groundwork for future evaluationparadigms.</description><author>Han Jiang, Xiaoyuan Yi, Zhihua Wei, Shu Wang, Xing Xie</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 03:47:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14230v2</guid></item><item><title>Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08940v1</link><description>The rapid growth of biomedical knowledge has outpaced our ability toefficiently extract insights and generate novel hypotheses. Large languagemodels (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool to revolutionize knowledgeinteraction and potentially accelerate biomedical discovery. In this paper, wepresent a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs as biomedical hypothesis generators.We construct a dataset of background-hypothesis pairs from biomedicalliterature, carefully partitioned into training, seen, and unseen test setsbased on publication date to mitigate data contamination. Using this dataset,we assess the hypothesis generation capabilities of top-tier instructed modelsin zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. To enhance the exploration ofuncertainty, a crucial aspect of scientific discovery, we incorporate tool useand multi-agent interactions in our evaluation framework. Furthermore, wepropose four novel metrics grounded in extensive literature review to evaluatethe quality of generated hypotheses, considering both LLM-based and humanassessments. Our experiments yield two key findings: 1) LLMs can generate noveland validated hypotheses, even when tested on literature unseen duringtraining, and 2) Increasing uncertainty through multi-agent interactions andtool use can facilitate diverse candidate generation and improve zero-shothypothesis generation performance. However, we also observe that theintegration of additional knowledge through few-shot learning and tool use maynot always lead to performance gains, highlighting the need for carefulconsideration of the type and scope of external knowledge incorporated. Thesefindings underscore the potential of LLMs as powerful aids in biomedicalhypothesis generation and provide valuable insights to guide further researchin this area.</description><author>Biqing Qi, Kaiyan Zhang, Kai Tian, Haoxiang Li, Zhang-Ren Chen, Sihang Zeng, Ermo Hua, Hu Jinfang, Bowen Zhou</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 02:55:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08940v1</guid></item><item><title>CXR-Agent: Vision-language models for chest X-ray interpretation with uncertainty aware radiology reporting</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08811v1</link><description>Recently large vision-language models have shown potential when interpretingcomplex images and generating natural language descriptions using advancedreasoning. Medicine's inherently multimodal nature incorporating scans andtext-based medical histories to write reports makes it conducive to benefitfrom these leaps in AI capabilities. We evaluate the publicly available, stateof the art, foundational vision-language models for chest X-ray interpretationacross several datasets and benchmarks. We use linear probes to evaluate theperformance of various components including CheXagent's vision transformer andQ-former, which outperform the industry-standard Torch X-ray Vision modelsacross many different datasets showing robust generalisation capabilities.Importantly, we find that vision-language models often hallucinate withconfident language, which slows down clinical interpretation. Based on thesefindings, we develop an agent-based vision-language approach for reportgeneration using CheXagent's linear probes and BioViL-T's phrase groundingtools to generate uncertainty-aware radiology reports with pathologieslocalised and described based on their likelihood. We thoroughly evaluate ourvision-language agents using NLP metrics, chest X-ray benchmarks and clinicalevaluations by developing an evaluation platform to perform a user study withrespiratory specialists. Our results show considerable improvements inaccuracy, interpretability and safety of the AI-generated reports. We stressthe importance of analysing results for normal and abnormal scans separately.Finally, we emphasise the need for larger paired (scan and report) datasetsalongside data augmentation to tackle overfitting seen in these largevision-language models.</description><author>Naman Sharma</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 18:39:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08811v1</guid></item></channel></rss>

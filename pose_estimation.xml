However, due to incomplete observation measurements andsparsity of the LiDAR point cloud, it is challenging to achieve satisfactorypose extraction based on 3D LiDAR by using the existing pose estimationmethods. In addition, the requirement for real-time performance furtherincreases the difficulty of the pose estimation task. In this paper, weproposed a novel convex hull-based vehicle pose estimation method. Theextracted 3D cluster is reduced to the convex hull, reducing the computationburden and retaining contour information. Then a novel criterion based on theminimum occlusion area is developed for the search-based algorithm, which canachieve accurate pose estimation. This criterion also makes the proposedalgorithm especially suitable for obstacle avoidance. The proposed algorithm isvalidated on the KITTI dataset and a manually labeled dataset acquired at anindustrial park. The results show that our proposed method can achieve betteraccuracy than the state-of-the-art pose estimation method while maintainingreal-time speed.</description><author>Ningning Ding</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2023 00:47:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01034v2</guid></item><item><title>Robust Single-view Cone-beam X-ray Pose Estimation with Neural Tuned Tomography (NeTT) and Masked Neural Radiance Fields (mNeRF)</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00214v1</link><description>Many tasks performed in image-guided, mini-invasive, medical procedures canbe cast as pose estimation problems, where an X-ray projection is utilized toreach a target in 3D space. Recent advances in the differentiable rendering ofoptically reflective materials have enabled state-of-the-art performance in RGBcamera view synthesis and pose estimation. Expanding on these prior works, weintroduce new methods for pose estimation of radiolucent objects using X-rayprojections, and we demonstrate the critical role of optimal view synthesis inperforming this task. We first develop an algorithm (DiffDRR) that efficientlycomputes Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) and leverages automaticdifferentiation within TensorFlow. In conjunction with classic CBCTreconstruction algorithms, we perform pose estimation by gradient descent usinga loss function that quantifies the similarity of the DRR synthesized from arandomly initialized pose and the true fluoroscopic image at the target pose.We propose two novel methods for high-fidelity view synthesis, Neural TunedTomography (NeTT) and masked Neural Radiance Fields (mNeRF). Both methods relyon classic CBCT; NeTT directly optimizes the CBCT densities, while the non-zerovalues of mNeRF are constrained by a 3D mask of the anatomic region segmentedfrom CBCT. We demonstrate that both NeTT and mNeRF distinctly improve poseestimation within our framework. By defining a successful pose estimate to be a3D angle error of less than 3 deg, we find that NeTT and mNeRF can achievesimilar results, both with overall success rates more than 93%. Furthermore, weshow that a NeTT trained for a single subject can generalize to synthesizehigh-fidelity DRRs and ensure robust pose estimations for all other subjects.Therefore, we suggest that NeTT is an attractive option for robust poseestimation using fluoroscopic projections.</description><author>Chaochao Zhou, Syed Hasib Akhter Faruqui, Abhinav Patel, Ramez N.

First, their lack of distinguishing visual features makes transparentobjects harder to detect and localize than opaque objects. Even humans findcertain transparent surfaces with little specular reflection or refraction,like glass doors, difficult to perceive. A second challenge is that depthsensors typically used for opaque object perception cannot obtain accuratedepth measurements on transparent surfaces due to their unique reflectiveproperties. Stemming from these challenges, we observe that transparent objectinstances within the same category, such as cups, look more similar to eachother than to ordinary opaque objects of that same category. Given thisobservation, the present paper explores the possibility of category-leveltransparent object pose estimation rather than instance-level pose estimation.We propose \textit{\textbf{TransNet}}, a two-stage pipeline that estimatescategory-level transparent object pose using localized depth completion andsurface normal estimation. TransNet is evaluated in terms of pose estimationaccuracy on a large-scale transparent object dataset and compared to astate-of-the-art category-level pose estimation approach. Results from thiscomparison demonstrate that TransNet achieves improved pose estimation accuracyon transparent objects. Moreover, we use TransNet to build an autonomoustransparent object manipulation system for robotic pick-and-place and pouringtasks.</description><author>Huijie Zhang, Anthony Opipari, Xiaotong Chen, Jiyue Zhu, Zeren Yu, Odest Chadwicke Jenkins</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 19:38:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12400v1</guid></item><item><title>GLA-GCN: Global-local Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network for 3D Human Pose Estimation from Monocular Video</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05853v2</link><description>3D human pose estimation has been researched for decades with promisingfruits. 3D human pose lifting is one of the promising research directionstoward the task where both estimated pose and ground truth pose data are usedfor training. Existing pose lifting works mainly focus on improving theperformance of estimated pose, but they usually underperform when testing onthe ground truth pose data. We observe that the performance of the estimatedpose can be easily improved by preparing good quality 2D pose, such asfine-tuning the 2D pose or using advanced 2D pose detectors. As such, weconcentrate on improving the 3D human pose lifting via ground truth data forthe future improvement of more quality estimated pose data. Towards this goal,a simple yet effective model called Global-local Adaptive Graph ConvolutionalNetwork (GLA-GCN) is proposed in this work. Our GLA-GCN globally models thespatiotemporal structure via a graph representation and backtraces local jointfeatures for 3D human pose estimation via individually connected layers. Tovalidate our model design, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmarkdatasets: Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP. Experimental results showthat our GLA-GCN implemented with ground truth 2D poses significantlyoutperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., up to around 3%, 17%, and 14% errorreductions on Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP, respectively).

Monocular object pose estimation gained considerable momentumwith the rise of high-performing deep learning-based solutions and isparticularly interesting for the community since sensors are inexpensive andinference is fast. Prior works establish the comprehensive state of the art fordiverse pose estimation problems. Their broad scopes make it difficult toidentify promising future directions. We narrow down the scope to the problemof single-shot monocular 6D object pose estimation, which is commonly used inrobotics, and thus are able to identify such trends. By reviewing recentpublications in robotics and computer vision, the state of the art isestablished at the union of both fields. Following that, we identify promisingresearch directions in order to help researchers to formulate relevant researchideas and effectively advance the state of the art. Findings include thatmethods are sophisticated enough to overcome the domain shift and thatocclusion handling is a fundamental challenge. We also highlight problems suchas novel object pose estimation and challenging materials handling as centralchallenges to advance robotics.</description><author>Stefan Thalhammer, Peter HÃ¶nig, Jean-Baptiste Weibel, Markus Vincze</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 20:21:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11827v2</guid></item><item><title>Certifiable 3D Object Pose Estimation: Foundations, Learning Models, and Self-Training</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11215v4</link><description>We consider a certifiable object pose estimation problem, where -- given apartial point cloud of an object -- the goal is to not only estimate the objectpose, but also to provide a certificate of correctness for the resultingestimate. Our first contribution is a general theory of certification forend-to-end perception models. In particular, we introduce the notion of$\zeta$-correctness, which bounds the distance between an estimate and theground truth. We show that $\zeta$-correctness can be assessed by implementingtwo certificates: (i) a certificate of observable correctness, that asserts ifthe model output is consistent with the input data and prior information, (ii)a certificate of non-degeneracy, that asserts whether the input data issufficient to compute a unique estimate. Our second contribution is to applythis theory and design a new learning-based certifiable pose estimator. Wepropose C-3PO, a semantic-keypoint-based pose estimation model, augmented withthe two certificates, to solve the certifiable pose estimation problem. C-3POalso includes a keypoint corrector, implemented as a differentiableoptimization layer, that can correct large detection errors (e.g. due to thesim-to-real gap). Our third contribution is a novel self-supervised trainingapproach that uses our certificate of observable correctness to provide thesupervisory signal to C-3PO during training. In it, the model trains only onthe observably correct input-output pairs, in each training iteration. Astraining progresses, we see that the observably correct input-output pairsgrow, eventually reaching near 100% in many cases. Our experiments show that(i) standard semantic-keypoint-based methods outperform more recentalternatives, (ii) C-3PO further improves performance and significantlyoutperforms all the baselines, and (iii) C-3PO's certificates are able todiscern correct pose estimates.</description><author>Rajat Talak, Lisa Peng, Luca Carlone</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 20:47:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11215v4</guid></item><item><title>A Correct-and-Certify Approach to Self-Supervise Object Pose Estimators via Ensemble Self-Training</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06019v2</link><description>Real-world robotics applications demand object pose estimation methods thatwork reliably across a variety of scenarios. Modern learning-based approachesrequire large labeled datasets and tend to perform poorly outside the trainingdomain. Our first contribution is to develop a robust corrector module thatcorrects pose estimates using depth information, thus enabling existing methodsto better generalize to new test domains; the corrector operates on semantickeypoints (but is also applicable to other pose estimators) and is fullydifferentiable. Our second contribution is an ensemble self-training approachthat simultaneously trains multiple pose estimators in a self-supervisedmanner. Our ensemble self-training architecture uses the robust corrector torefine the output of each pose estimator; then, it evaluates the quality of theoutputs using observable correctness certificates; finally, it uses theobservably correct outputs for further training, without requiring externalsupervision. As an additional contribution, we propose small improvements to aregression-based keypoint detection architecture, to enhance its robustness tooutliers; these improvements include a robust pooling scheme and a robustcentroid computation. Experiments on the YCBV and TLESS datasets show theproposed ensemble self-training outperforms fully supervised baselines whilenot requiring 3D annotations on real data.</description><author>Jingnan Shi, Rajat Talak, Dominic Maggio, Luca Carlone</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 19:46:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06019v2</guid></item><item><title>YOLOPose V2: Understanding and Improving Transformer-based 6D Pose Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11550v1</link><description>6D object pose estimation is a crucial prerequisite for autonomous robotmanipulation applications. The state-of-the-art models for pose estimation areconvolutional neural network (CNN)-based. Lately, Transformers, an architectureoriginally proposed for natural language processing, is achievingstate-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks as well. Equipped withthe multi-head self-attention mechanism, Transformers enable simplesingle-stage end-to-end architectures for learning object detection and 6Dobject pose estimation jointly. In this work, we propose YOLOPose (short formfor You Only Look Once Pose estimation), a Transformer-based multi-object 6Dpose estimation method based on keypoint regression and an improved variant ofthe YOLOPose model. In contrast to the standard heatmaps for predictingkeypoints in an image, we directly regress the keypoints. Additionally, weemploy a learnable orientation estimation module to predict the orientationfrom the keypoints. Along with a separate translation estimation module, ourmodel is end-to-end differentiable. Our method is suitable for real-timeapplications and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Weanalyze the role of object queries in our architecture and reveal that theobject queries specialize in detecting objects in specific image regions.Furthermore, we quantify the accuracy trade-off of using datasets of smallersizes to train our model.</description><author>Arul Selvam Periyasamy, Arash Amini, Vladimir Tsaturyan, Sven Behnke</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 13:53:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11550v1</guid></item><item><title>Affine Correspondences between Multi-Camera Systems for Relative Pose Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12996v1</link><description>We present a novel method to compute the relative pose of multi-camerasystems using two affine correspondences (ACs). Existing solutions to themulti-camera relative pose estimation are either restricted to special cases ofmotion, have too high computational complexity, or require too many pointcorrespondences (PCs). Thus, these solvers impede an efficient or accuraterelative pose estimation when applying RANSAC as a robust estimator. This papershows that the 6DOF relative pose estimation problem using ACs permits afeasible minimal solution, when exploiting the geometric constraints betweenACs and multi-camera systems using a special parameterization. We present aproblem formulation based on two ACs that encompass two common types of ACsacross two views, i.e., inter-camera and intra-camera. Moreover, the frameworkfor generating the minimal solvers can be extended to solve various relativepose estimation problems, e.g., 5DOF relative pose estimation with knownrotation angle prior. Experiments on both virtual and real multi-camera systemsprove that the proposed solvers are more efficient than the state-of-the-artalgorithms, while resulting in a better relative pose accuracy.

Unlike generalhuman pose estimation, goalie pose estimation is much more complex as itinvolves not only the detection of keypoints corresponding to the joints of thegoalie concealed under thick padding and mask, but also a large number ofnon-human keypoints corresponding to the large leg pads and gloves worn, thestick, as well as the hockey net. To tackle this challenge, we introduceGoalieNet, a multi-stage deep neural network for jointly estimating the pose ofthe goalie, their equipment, and the net. Experimental results using NHLbenchmark data demonstrate that the proposed GoalieNet can achieve an averageof 84\% accuracy across all keypoints, where 22 out of 29 keypoints aredetected with more than 80\% accuracy. This indicates that such a joint poseestimation approach can be a promising research direction.</description><author>Marjan Shahi, David Clausi, Alexander Wong</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2023 02:00:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15853v1</guid></item><item><title>Mutual Information-Based Temporal Difference Learning for Human Pose Estimation in Video</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08475v2</link><description>Temporal modeling is crucial for multi-frame human pose estimation. Mostexisting methods directly employ optical flow or deformable convolution topredict full-spectrum motion fields, which might incur numerous irrelevantcues, such as a nearby person or background. Without further efforts toexcavate meaningful motion priors, their results are suboptimal, especially incomplicated spatiotemporal interactions. On the other hand, the temporaldifference has the ability to encode representative motion information whichcan potentially be valuable for pose estimation but has not been fullyexploited. In this paper, we present a novel multi-frame human pose estimationframework, which employs temporal differences across frames to model dynamiccontexts and engages mutual information objectively to facilitate useful motioninformation disentanglement. To be specific, we design a multi-stage TemporalDifference Encoder that performs incremental cascaded learning conditioned onmulti-stage feature difference sequences to derive informative motionrepresentation. We further propose a Representation Disentanglement module fromthe mutual information perspective, which can grasp discriminativetask-relevant motion signals by explicitly defining useful and noisyconstituents of the raw motion features and minimizing their mutualinformation.

Toalleviate the label-hungry limitation, we propose a self-supervised learningframework, HaMuCo, that learns a single-view hand pose estimator frommulti-view pseudo 2D labels. However, one of the main challenges ofself-supervised learning is the presence of noisy labels and the ``groupthink''effect from multiple views. To overcome these issues, we introduce a cross-viewinteraction network that distills the single-view estimator by utilizing thecross-view correlated features and enforcing multi-view consistency to achievecollaborative learning. Both the single-view estimator and the cross-viewinteraction network are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Extensiveexperiments show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance onmulti-view self-supervised hand pose estimation. Furthermore, the proposedcross-view interaction network can also be applied to hand pose estimation frommulti-view input and outperforms previous methods under the same settings.</description><author>Xiaozheng Zheng, Chao Wen, Zhou Xue, Pengfei Ren, Jingyu Wang</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 05:51:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00988v2</guid></item><item><title>Perspective-1-Ellipsoid: Formulation, Analysis and Solutions of the Camera Pose Estimation Problem from One Ellipse-Ellipsoid Correspondence</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12513v3</link><description>In computer vision, camera pose estimation from correspondences between 3Dgeometric entities and their projections into the image has been a widelyinvestigated problem. Although most state-of-the-art methods exploit low-levelprimitives such as points or lines, the emergence of very effective CNN-basedobject detectors in the recent years has paved the way to the use ofhigher-level features carrying semantically meaningful information. Pioneeringworks in that direction have shown that modelling 3D objects by ellipsoids and2D detections by ellipses offers a convenient manner to link 2D and 3D data.However, the mathematical formalism most often used in the related litteraturedoes not enable to easily distinguish ellipsoids and ellipses from otherquadrics and conics, leading to a loss of specificity potentially detrimentalin some developments. Moreover, the linearization process of the projectionequation creates an over-representation of the camera parameters, also possiblycausing an efficiency loss. In this paper, we therefore introduce anellipsoid-specific theoretical framework and demonstrate its beneficialproperties in the context of pose estimation. More precisely, we first showthat the proposed formalism enables to reduce the pose estimation problem to aposition or orientation-only estimation problem in which the remaining unknownscan be derived in closed-form. Then, we demonstrate that it can be furtherreduced to a 1 Degree-of-Freedom (1DoF) problem and provide the analyticalderivations of the pose as a function of that unique scalar unknown. Weillustrate our theoretical considerations by visual examples and include adiscussion on the practical aspects.

However, extending such models tomulti-frame human pose estimation is non-trivial due to the presence of theadditional temporal dimension in videos. More importantly, learningrepresentations that focus on keypoint regions is crucial for accuratelocalization of human joints. Nevertheless, the adaptation of thediffusion-based methods remains unclear on how to achieve such objective. Inthis paper, we present DiffPose, a novel diffusion architecture that formulatesvideo-based human pose estimation as a conditional heatmap generation problem.First, to better leverage temporal information, we propose SpatioTemporalRepresentation Learner which aggregates visual evidences across frames and usesthe resulting features in each denoising step as a condition. In addition, wepresent a mechanism called Lookup-based MultiScale Feature Interaction thatdetermines the correlations between local joints and global contexts acrossmultiple scales. This mechanism generates delicate representations that focuson keypoint regions. Altogether, by extending diffusion models, we show twounique characteristics from DiffPose on pose estimation task: (i) the abilityto combine multiple sets of pose estimates to improve prediction accuracy,particularly for challenging joints, and (ii) the ability to adjust the numberof iterative steps for feature refinement without retraining the model.DiffPose sets new state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks: PoseTrack2017,PoseTrack2018, and PoseTrack21.</description><author>Runyang Feng, Yixing Gao, Tze Ho Elden Tse, Xueqing Ma, Hyung Jin Chang</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 11:54:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16687v2</guid></item><item><title>KVN: Keypoints Voting Network with Differentiable RANSAC for Stereo Pose Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11543v1</link><description>Object pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task exploited inseveral robotics and augmented reality applications.

Inparticular, we study how pose can be estimated from force and tactile dataarising from contact. Using data derived from contact is challenging because itis inherently less information-dense than visual data, and thus the poseestimation problem is severely under-constrained when there are few contacts.Rather than attempting to estimate the true pose of the object, which is nottractable without a large number of contacts, we seek to estimate a plausibleset of poses which obey the constraints imposed by the sensor data. Existingmethods struggle to estimate this set because they are either designed forsingle pose estimates or require informative priors to be effective. Ourapproach to this problem, Constrained pose Hypothesis Set Elimination (CHSEL),has three key attributes: 1) It considers volumetric information, which allowsus to account for known free space; 2) It uses a novel differentiablevolumetric cost function to take advantage of powerful gradient-basedoptimization tools; and 3) It uses methods from the Quality Diversity (QD)optimization literature to produce a diverse set of high-quality poses. To ourknowledge, QD methods have not been used previously for pose registration. Wealso show how to update our plausible pose estimates online as more data isgathered by the robot. Our experiments suggest that CHSEL shows largeperformance improvements over several baseline methods for both simulated andreal-world data.</description><author>Sheng Zhong, Nima Fazeli, Dmitry Berenson</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2023 02:43:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08042v1</guid></item><item><title>EgoPoser: Robust Real-Time Ego-Body Pose Estimation in Large Scenes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06493v1</link><description>Full-body ego-pose estimation from head and hand poses alone has become anactive area of research to power articulate avatar representation onheadset-based platforms. However, existing methods over-rely on the confines ofthe motion-capture spaces in which datasets were recorded, while simultaneouslyassuming continuous capture of joint motions and uniform body dimensions. Inthis paper, we propose EgoPoser, which overcomes these limitations by 1)rethinking the input representation for headset-based ego-pose estimation andintroducing a novel motion decomposition method that predicts full-body poseindependent of global positions, 2) robustly modeling body pose fromintermittent hand position and orientation tracking only when inside aheadset's field of view, and 3) generalizing across various body sizes fordifferent users. Our experiments show that EgoPoser outperformsstate-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, whilemaintaining a high inference speed of over 600 fps. EgoPoser establishes arobust baseline for future work, where full-body pose estimation needs nolonger rely on outside-in capture and can scale to large-scene environments.</description><author>Jiaxi Jiang, Paul Streli, Manuel Meier, Andreas Fender, Christian Holz</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2023 08:46:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06493v1</guid></item><item><title>Neural Voting Field for Camera-Space 3D Hand Pose Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04328v1</link><description>We present a unified framework for camera-space 3D hand pose estimation froma single RGB image based on 3D implicit representation. As opposed to recentworks, most of which first adopt holistic or pixel-level dense regression toobtain relative 3D hand pose and then follow with complex second-stageoperations for 3D global root or scale recovery, we propose a novel unified 3Ddense regression scheme to estimate camera-space 3D hand pose via dense 3Dpoint-wise voting in camera frustum. Through direct dense modeling in 3D domaininspired by Pixel-aligned Implicit Functions for 3D detailed reconstruction,our proposed Neural Voting Field (NVF) fully models 3D dense local evidence andhand global geometry, helping to alleviate common 2D-to-3D ambiguities.Specifically, for a 3D query point in camera frustum and its pixel-alignedimage feature, NVF, represented by a Multi-Layer Perceptron, regresses: (i) itssigned distance to the hand surface; (ii) a set of 4D offset vectors (1D votingweight and 3D directional vector to each hand joint). Following a vote-castingscheme, 4D offset vectors from near-surface points are selected to calculatethe 3D hand joint coordinates by a weighted average. Experiments demonstratethat NVF outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on FreiHAND datasetfor camera-space 3D hand pose estimation. We also adapt NVF to the classic taskof root-relative 3D hand pose estimation, for which NVF also obtainsstate-of-the-art results on HO3D dataset.</description><author>Lin Huang, Chung-Ching Lin, Kevin Lin, Lin Liang, Lijuan Wang, Junsong Yuan, Zicheng Liu</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2023 17:51:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04328v1</guid></item><item><title>Relation-Based Associative Joint Location for Human Pose Estimation in Videos</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03591v3</link><description>Video-based human pose estimation (VHPE) is a vital yet challenging task.While deep learning methods have made significant progress for the VHPE, mostapproaches to this task implicitly model the long-range interaction betweenjoints by enlarging the receptive field of the convolution. Unlike priormethods, we design a lightweight and plug-and-play joint relation extractor(JRE) to model the associative relationship between joints explicitly andautomatically. The JRE takes the pseudo heatmaps of joints as input andcalculates the similarity between pseudo heatmaps. In this way, the JREflexibly learns the relationship between any two joints, allowing it to learnthe rich spatial configuration of human poses. Moreover, the JRE can inferinvisible joints according to the relationship between joints, which isbeneficial for the model to locate occluded joints. Then, combined withtemporal semantic continuity modeling, we propose a Relation-based PoseSemantics Transfer Network (RPSTN) for video-based human pose estimation.Specifically, to capture the temporal dynamics of poses, the pose semanticinformation of the current frame is transferred to the next with a jointrelation guided pose semantics propagator (JRPSP). The proposed model cantransfer the pose semantic features from the non-occluded frame to the occludedframe, making our method robust to the occlusion. Furthermore, the proposed JREmodule is also suitable for image-based human pose estimation. The proposedRPSTN achieves state-of-the-art results on the video-based Penn Action dataset,Sub-JHMDB dataset, and PoseTrack2018 dataset. Moreover, the proposed JREimproves the performance of backbones on the image-based COCO2017 dataset.

These limitationsmainly come from the necessity of 3D models, closed-category detection, and alarge number of densely annotated support views. To mitigate this issue, wepropose a general paradigm for object pose estimation, called Promptable ObjectPose Estimation (POPE). The proposed approach POPE enables zero-shot 6DoFobject pose estimation for any target object in any scene, while only a singlereference is adopted as the support view. To achieve this, POPE leverages thepower of the pre-trained large-scale 2D foundation model, employs a frameworkwith hierarchical feature representation and 3D geometry principles. Moreover,it estimates the relative camera pose between object prompts and the targetobject in new views, enabling both two-view and multi-view 6DoF pose estimationtasks. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that POPE exhibitsunrivaled robust performance in zero-shot settings, by achieving a significantreduction in the averaged Median Pose Error by 52.38% and 50.47% on the LINEMODand OnePose datasets, respectively. We also conduct more challenging testingsin causally captured images (see Figure 1), which further demonstrates therobustness of POPE.

However, it usually suffers from a lack of generalization to newinstances and object types. Most widely used methods learn to infer the objectpose in a discriminative setup where the model filters useful information toinfer the exact pose of the object. While such methods offer accurate poses,the model does not store enough information to generalize to new objects. Inthis work, we address the generalization capability of pose estimation usingmodels that contain enough information about the object to render it indifferent poses. We follow the line of work that inverts neural renderers toinfer the pose. We propose i-$\sigma$SRN to maximize the information flowingfrom the input pose to the rendered scene and invert them to infer the posegiven an input image. Specifically, we extend Scene Representation Networks(SRNs) by incorporating a separate network for density estimation and introducea new way of obtaining a weighted scene representation. We investigate severalways of initial pose estimates and losses for the neural renderer. Our finalevaluation shows a significant improvement in inference performance and speedcompared to existing approaches.</description><author>Vaibhav Saxena, Kamal Rahimi Malekshan, Linh Tran, Yotto Koga</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 21:42:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17252v1</guid></item><item><title>Challenges for Monocular 6D Object Pose Estimation in Robotics</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12172v1</link><description>Object pose estimation is a core perception task that enables, for example,object grasping and scene understanding. The widely available, inexpensive andhigh-resolution RGB sensors and CNNs that allow for fast inference based onthis modality make monocular approaches especially well suited for roboticsapplications. We observe that previous surveys on object pose estimationestablish the state of the art for varying modalities, single- and multi-viewsettings, and datasets and metrics that consider a multitude of applications.We argue, however, that those works' broad scope hinders the identification ofopen challenges that are specific to monocular approaches and the derivation ofpromising future challenges for their application in robotics. By providing aunified view on recent publications from both robotics and computer vision, wefind that occlusion handling, novel pose representations, and formalizing andimproving category-level pose estimation are still fundamental challenges thatare highly relevant for robotics. Moreover, to further improve roboticperformance, large object sets, novel objects, refractive materials, anduncertainty estimates are central, largely unsolved open challenges. In orderto address them, ontological reasoning, deformability handling, scene-levelreasoning, realistic datasets, and the ecological footprint of algorithms needto be improved.</description><author>Stefan Thalhammer, Dominik Bauer, Peter HÃ¶nig, Jean-Baptiste Weibel, JosÃ© GarcÃ­a-RodrÃ­guez, Markus Vincze</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2023 22:36:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12172v1</guid></item><item><title>Depth-based 6DoF Object Pose Estimation using Swin Transformer</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02133v2</link><description>Accurately estimating the 6D pose of objects is crucial for manyapplications, such as robotic grasping, autonomous driving, and augmentedreality. However, this task becomes more challenging in poor lightingconditions or when dealing with textureless objects. To address this issue,depth images are becoming an increasingly popular choice due to theirinvariance to a scene's appearance and the implicit incorporation of essentialgeometric characteristics. However, fully leveraging depth information toimprove the performance of pose estimation remains a difficult andunder-investigated problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novelframework called SwinDePose, that uses only geometric information from depthimages to achieve accurate 6D pose estimation. SwinDePose first calculates theangles between each normal vector defined in a depth image and the threecoordinate axes in the camera coordinate system. The resulting angles are thenformed into an image, which is encoded using Swin Transformer. Additionally, weapply RandLA-Net to learn the representations from point clouds. The resultingimage and point clouds embeddings are concatenated and fed into a semanticsegmentation module and a 3D keypoints localization module. Finally, weestimate 6D poses using a least-square fitting approach based on the targetobject's predicted semantic mask and 3D keypoints. In experiments on theLineMod and Occlusion LineMod datasets, SwinDePose outperforms existingstate-of-the-art methods for 6D object pose estimation using depth images. Thisdemonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and highlights its potential forimproving performance in real-world scenarios.

Existing pose lifting works mainly focus on improving theperformance of estimated pose, but they usually underperform when testing onthe ground truth pose data. We observe that the performance of the estimatedpose can be easily improved by preparing good quality 2D pose, such asfine-tuning the 2D pose or using advanced 2D pose detectors. As such, weconcentrate on improving the 3D human pose lifting via ground truth data forthe future improvement of more quality estimated pose data. Towards this goal,a simple yet effective model called Global-local Adaptive Graph ConvolutionalNetwork (GLA-GCN) is proposed in this work. Our GLA-GCN globally models thespatiotemporal structure via a graph representation and backtraces local jointfeatures for 3D human pose estimation via individually connected layers. Tovalidate our model design, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmarkdatasets: Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP. Experimental results showthat our GLA-GCN implemented with ground truth 2D poses significantlyoutperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., up to around 3%, 17%, and 13% errorreductions on Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP, respectively).</description><author>Bruce X.

Existing methods primarily focus on pair-wise interaction ofbody joints, which is insufficient for scenarios involving overlapping jointsand rapidly changing poses. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novelapproach, the High-order Directed Transformer (HDFormer), which leverageshigh-order bone and joint relationships for improved pose estimation.Specifically, HDFormer incorporates both self-attention and high-orderattention to formulate a multi-order attention module. This module facilitatesfirst-order "joint$\leftrightarrow$joint", second-order"bone$\leftrightarrow$joint", and high-order "hyperbone$\leftrightarrow$joint"interactions, effectively addressing issues in complex and occlusion-heavysituations. In addition, modern CNN techniques are integrated into thetransformer-based architecture, balancing the trade-off between performance andefficiency. HDFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) modelson Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, requiring only 1/10 of the parametersand significantly lower computational costs.

However, mostof these methods tend to focus on learning relationships between body joints ofthe skeleton using first-order neighbors, ignoring higher-order neighbors andhence limiting their ability to exploit relationships between distant joints.In this paper, we introduce a higher-order regular splitting graph network(RS-Net) for 2D-to-3D human pose estimation using matrix splitting inconjunction with weight and adjacency modulation. The core idea is to capturelong-range dependencies between body joints using multi-hop neighborhoods andalso to learn different modulation vectors for different body joints as well asa modulation matrix added to the adjacency matrix associated to the skeleton.This learnable modulation matrix helps adjust the graph structure by addingextra graph edges in an effort to learn additional connections between bodyjoints. Instead of using a shared weight matrix for all neighboring bodyjoints, the proposed RS-Net model applies weight unsharing before aggregatingthe feature vectors associated to the joints in order to capture the differentrelations between them.

In this paper, we propose a noveltransformer-based model EvoPose to introduce the human body prior knowledge for3D human pose estimation effectively. Specifically, a Structural PriorsRepresentation (SPR) module represents human priors as structural featurescarrying rich body patterns, e.g. joint relationships. The structural featuresare interacted with 2D pose sequences and help the model to achieve moreinformative spatiotemporal features.

To improve the accuracyof the estimated pose, state-of-the-art approaches in 6D object pose estimationuse observational data from one or more modalities, e.g., RGB images, depth,and tactile readings. However, existing approaches make limited use of theunderlying geometric structure of the object captured by these modalities,thereby, increasing their reliance on visual features. This results in poorperformance when presented with objects that lack such visual features or whenvisual features are simply occluded. Furthermore, current approaches do nottake advantage of the proprioceptive information embedded in the position ofthe fingers. To address these limitations, in this paper: (1) we introduce ahierarchical graph neural network architecture for combining multimodal (visionand touch) data that allows for a geometrically informed 6D object poseestimation, (2) we introduce a hierarchical message passing operation thatflows the information within and across modalities to learn a graph-basedobject representation, and (3) we introduce a method that accounts for theproprioceptive information for in-hand object representation. We evaluate ourmodel on a diverse subset of objects from the YCB Object and Model Set, andshow that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art workin accuracy and robustness to occlusion.

Recent studies have shown the great potential ofdense correspondence-based solutions, yet improvements are still needed toreach practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel pose estimationalgorithm named CheckerPose, which improves on three main aspects. Firstly,CheckerPose densely samples 3D keypoints from the surface of the 3D object andfinds their 2D correspondences progressively in the 2D image. Compared toprevious solutions that conduct dense sampling in the image space, our strategyenables the correspondence searching in a 2D grid (i.e., pixel coordinate).Secondly, for our 3D-to-2D correspondence, we design a compact binary coderepresentation for 2D image locations. This representation not only allows forprogressive correspondence refinement but also converts the correspondenceregression to a more efficient classification problem. Thirdly, we adopt agraph neural network to explicitly model the interactions among the sampled 3Dkeypoints, further boosting the reliability and accuracy of thecorrespondences. Together, these novel components make CheckerPose a strongpose estimation algorithm. When evaluated on the popular Linemod, Linemod-O,and YCB-V object pose estimation benchmarks, CheckerPose clearly boosts theaccuracy of correspondence-based methods and achieves state-of-the-artperformances.

State-of-the-art solutions adopt the DETR-like framework, andmainly develop the complex decoder, e.g., regarding pose estimation as keypointbox detection and combining with human detection in ED-Pose, hierarchicallypredicting with pose decoder and joint (keypoint) decoder in PETR. We present asimple yet effective transformer approach, named Group Pose. We simply regard$K$-keypoint pose estimation as predicting a set of $N\times K$ keypointpositions, each from a keypoint query, as well as representing each pose withan instance query for scoring $N$ pose predictions. Motivated by the intuitionthat the interaction, among across-instance queries of different types, is notdirectly helpful, we make a simple modification to decoder self-attention. Wereplace single self-attention over all the $N\times(K+1)$ queries with twosubsequent group self-attentions: (i) $N$ within-instance self-attention, witheach over $K$ keypoint queries and one instance query, and (ii) $(K+1)$same-type across-instance self-attention, each over $N$ queries of the sametype. The resulting decoder removes the interaction among across-instancetype-different queries, easing the optimization and thus improving theperformance. Experimental results on MS COCO and CrowdPose show that ourapproach without human box supervision is superior to previous methods withcomplex decoders, and even is slightly better than ED-Pose that uses human boxsupervision. $\href{https://github.com/Michel-liu/GroupPose-Paddle}{\rmPaddle}$ and $\href{https://github.com/Michel-liu/GroupPose}{\rm PyTorch}$ codeare available.</description><author>Huan Liu, Qiang Chen, Zichang Tan, Jiang-Jiang Liu, Jian Wang, Xiangbo Su, Xiaolong Li, Kun Yao, Junyu Han, Errui Ding, Yao Zhao, Jingdong Wang</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2023 18:58:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07313v1</guid></item><item><title>Deep Fusion Transformer Network with Weighted Vector-Wise Keypoints Voting for Robust 6D Object Pose Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05438v1</link><description>One critical challenge in 6D object pose estimation from a single RGBD imageis efficient integration of two different modalities, i.e., color and depth.

Previous methods address this problem by leveraging anoff-the-shelf detector, heuristic post-grouping process or explicit instanceidentification process, hindering further improvements in the inference speedwhich is an important factor for practical applications. From the statisticalpoint of view, those additional processes for identifying instances arenecessary to bypass learning the high-dimensional joint distribution of humankeypoints, which is a critical factor for another major challenge, theocclusion scenario. In this work, we propose a novel framework of single-stageinstance-aware pose estimation by modeling the joint distribution of humankeypoints with a mixture density model, termed as MDPose.

Second, the relativeposes of the flying vehicle are calculated from detected markers using amonocular camera. Next, a Kalman filter is applied to provide a more stable andreliable pose estimation, especially when the measurement data is missing dueto unexpected reasons. Finally, we introduced an algorithm for merging theposes data from multi markers. The poses are then sent to the positioncontroller to align the drone and the marker's center and steer it to perch onthe target. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness andfeasibility of the adopted approach. The drone can perch successfully onto thecenter of the markers with the attached 25mm-diameter rounded magnet.</description><author>Truong-Dong Do, Nguyen Xuan-Mung, Sung-Kyung Hong</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 17:51:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14838v1</guid></item><item><title>Human Body Pose Estimation for Gait Identification: A Comprehensive Survey of Datasets and Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13765v1</link><description>Person identification is a problem that has received substantial attention,particularly in security domains. Gait recognition is one of the mostconvenient approaches enabling person identification at a distance without theneed of high-quality images. There are several review studies addressing personidentification such as the utilization of facial images, silhouette images, andwearable sensor. Despite skeleton-based person identification gainingpopularity while overcoming the challenges of traditional approaches, existingsurvey studies lack the comprehensive review of skeleton-based approaches togait identification. We present a detailed review of the human pose estimationand gait analysis that make the skeleton-based approaches possible. The studycovers various types of related datasets, tools, methodologies, and evaluationmetrics with associated challenges, limitations, and application domains.Detailed comparisons are presented for each of these aspects withrecommendations for potential research and alternatives. A common trendthroughout this paper is the positive impact that deep learning techniques arebeginning to have on topics such as human pose estimation and gaitidentification. The survey outcomes might be useful for the related researchcommunity and other stakeholders in terms of performance analysis of existingmethodologies, potential research gaps, application domains, and possiblecontributions in the future.</description><author>Luke K.

Many existing methods rely onlearning geometric features that correspond to specific templates whiledisregarding shape variations and pose differences among objects in the samecategory. As a result, these methods underperform when handling unseen objectinstances in complex environments. In contrast, other approaches aim to achievecategory-level estimation and reconstruction by leveraging normalized geometricstructure priors, but the static prior-based reconstruction struggles withsubstantial intra-class variations. To solve these problems, we propose theDTF-Net, a novel framework for pose estimation and shape reconstruction basedon implicit neural fields of object categories. In DTF-Net, we design adeformable template field to represent the general category-wise shape latentfeatures and intra-category geometric deformation features. The fieldestablishes continuous shape correspondences, deforming the category templateinto arbitrary observed instances to accomplish shape reconstruction. Weintroduce a pose regression module that shares the deformation features andtemplate codes from the fields to estimate the accurate 6D pose of each objectin the scene. We integrate a multi-modal representation extraction module toextract object features and semantic masks, enabling end-to-end inference.Moreover, during training, we implement a shape-invariant training strategy anda viewpoint sampling method to further enhance the model's capability toextract object pose features. Extensive experiments on the REAL275 and CAMERA25datasets demonstrate the superiority of DTF-Net in both synthetic and realscenes. Furthermore, we show that DTF-Net effectively supports grasping taskswith a real robot arm.</description><author>Haowen Wang, Zhipeng Fan, Zhen Zhao, Zhengping Che, Zhiyuan Xu, Dong Liu, Feifei Feng, Yakun Huang, Xiuquan Qiao, Jian Tang</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 11:35:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02239v1</guid></item><item><title>EgoCOL: Egocentric Camera pose estimation for Open-world 3D object Localization @Ego4D challenge 2023</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16606v1</link><description>We present EgoCOL, an egocentric camera pose estimation method for open-world3D object localization.

Over time, a significantvolume of such data has been produced, but some computer vision techniquescannot explore it due to the lack of annotations. To address this, we proposean approach for estimating 2D mouse body pose from unlabelled images using asynthetically generated empirical pose prior. Our proposal is based on a recentself-supervised method for estimating 2D human pose that uses single images anda set of unpaired typical 2D poses within a GAN framework. We adapt this methodto the limb structure of the mouse and generate the empirical prior of 2D posesfrom a synthetic 3D mouse model, thereby avoiding manual annotation. Inexperiments on a new mouse video dataset, we evaluate the performance of theapproach by comparing pose predictions to a manually obtained ground truth. Wealso compare predictions with those from a supervised state-of-the-art methodfor animal pose estimation. The latter evaluation indicates promising resultsdespite the lack of paired training data. Finally, qualitative results using adataset of horse images show the potential of the setting to adapt to otheranimal species.</description><author>Jose Sosa, Sharn Perry, Jane Alty, David Hogg</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 10:31:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13361v1</guid></item><item><title>MELON: NeRF with Unposed Images in SO(3)</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08096v2</link><description>Neural radiance fields enable novel-view synthesis and scene reconstructionwith photorealistic quality from a few images, but require known and accuratecamera poses. Conventional pose estimation algorithms fail on smooth orself-similar scenes, while methods performing inverse rendering from unposedviews require a rough initialization of the camera orientations. The maindifficulty of pose estimation lies in real-life objects being almost invariantunder certain transformations, making the photometric distance between renderedviews non-convex with respect to the camera parameters. Using an equivalencerelation that matches the distribution of local minima in camera space, wereduce this space to its quotient set, in which pose estimation becomes a moreconvex problem. Using a neural-network to regularize pose estimation, wedemonstrate that our method - MELON - can reconstruct a neural radiance fieldfrom unposed images with state-of-the-art accuracy while requiring ten timesfewer views than adversarial approaches.</description><author>Axel Levy, Mark Matthews, Matan Sela, Gordon Wetzstein, Dmitry Lagun</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 09:19:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08096v2</guid></item><item><title>IST-Net: Prior-free Category-level Pose Estimation with Implicit Space Transformation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13479v2</link><description>Category-level 6D pose estimation aims to predict the poses and sizes ofunseen objects from a specific category. Thanks to prior deformation, whichexplicitly adapts a category-specific 3D prior (i.e., a 3D template) to a givenobject instance, prior-based methods attained great success and have become amajor research stream. However, obtaining category-specific priors requirescollecting a large amount of 3D models, which is labor-consuming and often notaccessible in practice. This motivates us to investigate whether priors arenecessary to make prior-based methods effective. Our empirical study shows thatthe 3D prior itself is not the credit to the high performance. The keypointactually is the explicit deformation process, which aligns camera and worldcoordinates supervised by world-space 3D models (also called canonical space).Inspired by these observations, we introduce a simple prior-free implicit spacetransformation network, namely IST-Net, to transform camera-space features toworld-space counterparts and build correspondence between them in an implicitmanner without relying on 3D priors. Besides, we design camera- and world-spaceenhancers to enrich the features with pose-sensitive information andgeometrical constraints, respectively.

Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has been proven inherently suitable tomodel the human skeletal topology. However, current GCN-based 3D HPE methodsupdate the node features by aggregating their neighbors' information withoutconsidering the interaction of joints in different motion patterns. Althoughsome studies import limb information to learn the movement patterns, the latentsynergies among joints, such as maintaining balance in the motion are seldominvestigated. We propose a hop-wise GraphFormer with intragroup jointrefinement (HopFIR) to tackle the 3D HPE problem. The HopFIR mainly consists ofa novel Hop-wise GraphFormer(HGF) module and an Intragroup JointRefinement(IJR) module which leverages the prior limb information forperipheral joints refinement. The HGF module groups the joints by $k$-hopneighbors and utilizes a hop-wise transformer-like attention mechanism amongthese groups to discover latent joint synergy. Extensive experimental resultsshow that HopFIR outperforms the SOTA methods with a large margin (on theHuman3.6M dataset, the mean per joint position error (MPJPE) is 32.67mm).Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that previous SOTA GCN-based methods canbenefit from the proposed hop-wise attention mechanism efficiently withsignificant performance promotion, such as SemGCN and MGCN are improved by 8.9%and 4.5%, respectively.</description><author>Kai Zhai, Qiang Nie, Bo Ouyang, Xiang Li, ShanLin Yang</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2023 17:07:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14581v2</guid></item><item><title>Revisiting Fully Convolutional Geometric Features for Object 6D Pose Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15514v1</link><description>Recent works on 6D object pose estimation focus on learning keypointcorrespondences between images and object models, and then determine the objectpose through RANSAC-based algorithms or by directly regressing the pose withend-to-end optimisations.

Thesevotes, learned by a regression network to accumulate evidence for the keypointlocations, can be regressed more accurately compared to previous heuristickeypoint algorithms. The proposed KeyGNet, supervised by a combined lossmeasuring both Wassserstein distance and dispersion, learns the color andgeometry features of the target objects to estimate optimal keypoint locations.Experiments demonstrate the keypoints selected by KeyGNet improved the accuracyfor all evaluation metrics of all seven datasets tested, for three keypointvoting methods. The challenging Occlusion LINEMOD dataset notably improvedADD(S) by +16.4% on PVN3D, and all core BOP datasets showed an AR improvementfor all objects, of between +1% and +21.5%. There was also a notable increasein performance when transitioning from single object to multiple objecttraining using KeyGNet keypoints, essentially eliminating the SISO-MIMO gap forOcclusion LINEMOD.</description><author>Yangzheng Wu, Michael Greenspan</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 16:11:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07827v1</guid></item><item><title>LU-NeRF: Scene and Pose Estimation by Synchronizing Local Unposed NeRFs</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05410v1</link><description>A critical obstacle preventing NeRF models from being deployed broadly in thewild is their reliance on accurate camera poses. Consequently, there is growinginterest in extending NeRF models to jointly optimize camera poses and scenerepresentation, which offers an alternative to off-the-shelf SfM pipelineswhich have well-understood failure modes. Existing approaches for unposed NeRFoperate under limited assumptions, such as a prior pose distribution or coarsepose initialization, making them less effective in a general setting. In thiswork, we propose a novel approach, LU-NeRF, that jointly estimates camera posesand neural radiance fields with relaxed assumptions on pose configuration. Ourapproach operates in a local-to-global manner, where we first optimize overlocal subsets of the data, dubbed mini-scenes. LU-NeRF estimates local pose andgeometry for this challenging few-shot task. The mini-scene poses are broughtinto a global reference frame through a robust pose synchronization step, wherea final global optimization of pose and scene can be performed. We show ourLU-NeRF pipeline outperforms prior attempts at unposed NeRF without makingrestrictive assumptions on the pose prior. This allows us to operate in thegeneral SE(3) pose setting, unlike the baselines. Our results also indicate ourmodel can be complementary to feature-based SfM pipelines as it comparesfavorably to COLMAP on low-texture and low-resolution images.</description><author>Zezhou Cheng, Carlos Esteves, Varun Jampani, Abhishek Kar, Subhransu Maji, Ameesh Makadia</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 18:56:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05410v1</guid></item><item><title>Occlusion Robust 3D Human Pose Estimation with StridedPoseGraphFormer and Data Augmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12069v1</link><description>Occlusion is an omnipresent challenge in 3D human pose estimation (HPE). Inspite of the large amount of research dedicated to 3D HPE, only a limitednumber of studies address the problem of occlusion explicitly. To fill thisgap, we propose to combine exploitation of spatio-temporal features withsynthetic occlusion augmentation during training to deal with occlusion. Tothis end, we build a spatio-temporal 3D HPE model, StridedPoseGraphFormer basedon graph convolution and transformers, and train it using occlusionaugmentation. Unlike the existing occlusion-aware methods, that are only testedfor limited occlusion, we extensively evaluate our method for varying degreesof occlusion. We show that our proposed method compares favorably with thestate-of-the-art (SoA). Our experimental results also reveal that in theabsence of any occlusion handling mechanism, the performance of SoA 3D HPEmethods degrades significantly when they encounter occlusion.</description><author>Soubarna Banik, Patricia GschoÃmann, Alejandro Mendoza Garcia, Alois Knoll</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 14:05:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12069v1</guid></item><item><title>LPFormer: LiDAR Pose Estimation Transformer with Multi-Task Network</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12525v1</link><description>In this technical report, we present the 1st place solution for the 2023Waymo Open Dataset Pose Estimation challenge. Due to the difficulty ofacquiring large-scale 3D human keypoint annotation, previous methods havecommonly relied on 2D image features and 2D sequential annotations for 3D humanpose estimation. In contrast, our proposed method, named LPFormer, uses onlyLiDAR as its input along with its corresponding 3D annotations. LPFormerconsists of two stages: the first stage detects the human bounding box andextracts multi-level feature representations, while the second stage employs atransformer-based network to regress the human keypoints using these features.Experimental results on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the top performance,and improvements even compared to previous multi-modal solutions.</description><author>Dongqiangzi Ye, Yufei Xie, Weijia Chen, Zixiang Zhou, Hassan Foroosh</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 20:20:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12525v1</guid></item><item><title>Hand Pose Estimation with Mems-Ultrasonic Sensors</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12652v1</link><description>Hand tracking is an important aspect of human-computer interaction and has awide range of applications in extended reality devices. However, current handmotion capture methods suffer from various limitations. For instance,visual-based hand pose estimation is susceptible to self-occlusion and changesin lighting conditions, while IMU-based tracking gloves experience significantdrift and are not resistant to external magnetic field interference. To addressthese issues, we propose a novel and low-cost hand-tracking glove that utilizesseveral MEMS-ultrasonic sensors attached to the fingers, to measure thedistance matrix among the sensors. Our lightweight deep network thenreconstructs the hand pose from the distance matrix. Our experimental resultsdemonstrate that this approach is both accurate, size-agnostic, and robust toexternal interference. We also show the design logic for the sensor selection,sensor configurations, circuit diagram, as well as model architecture.</description><author>Qiang Zhang, Yuanqiao Lin, Yubin Lin, Szymon Rusinkiewicz</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 04:41:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12652v1</guid></item><item><title>Next-generation Surgical Navigation: Multi-view Marker-less 6DoF Pose Estimation of Surgical Instruments</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03535v1</link><description>State-of-the-art research of traditional computer vision is increasinglyleveraged in the surgical domain. A particular focus in computer-assistedsurgery is to replace marker-based tracking systems for instrument localizationwith pure image-based 6DoF pose estimation. However, the state of the art hasnot yet met the accuracy required for surgical navigation. In this context, wepropose a high-fidelity marker-less optical tracking system for surgicalinstrument localization. We developed a multi-view camera setup consisting ofstatic and mobile cameras and collected a large-scale RGB-D video dataset withdedicated synchronization and data fusions methods. Different state-of-the-artpose estimation methods were integrated into a deep learning pipeline andevaluated on multiple camera configurations. Furthermore, the performanceimpacts of different input modalities and camera positions, as well as trainingon purely synthetic data, were compared. The best model achieved an averageposition and orientation error of 1.3 mm and 1.0{\deg} for a surgical drill aswell as 3.8 mm and 5.2{\deg} for a screwdriver. These results significantlyoutperform related methods in the literature and are close to clinical-gradeaccuracy, demonstrating that marker-less tracking of surgical instruments isbecoming a feasible alternative to existing marker-based systems.</description><author>Jonas Hein, Nicola Cavalcanti, Daniel Suter, Lukas Zingg, Fabio Carrillo, Mazda Farshad, Marc Pollefeys, Nassir Navab, Philipp FÃ¼rnstahl</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 14:42:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03535v1</guid></item><item><title>A Real-time Human Pose Estimation Approach for Optimal Sensor Placement in Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02906v1</link><description>Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition facilitates unobtrusive monitoring ofhuman movements.

To achieve this, we employ a dense 2D-to-3Dcorrespondence predictor that regresses 3D model coordinates for every pixel.In addition to the 3D coordinates, our model also estimates the pixel-wisecoordinate error to discard correspondences that are likely wrong. This allowsus to generate multiple 6D pose hypotheses of the object, which we then refineiteratively using a highly efficient region-based approach. We also introduce anovel pixel-wise posterior formulation by which we can estimate the probabilityfor each hypothesis and select the most likely one. As we show in experiments,our approach is capable of dealing with extreme visual conditions includingoverexposure, high contrast, or low signal-to-noise ratio. This makes it apowerful technique for the particularly challenging task of estimating the poseof tumbling satellites for in-orbit robotic applications. Our method achievesstate-of-the-art performance on the SPEED+ dataset and has won the SPEC2021post-mortem competition.</description><author>Maximilian Ulmer, Maximilian Durner, Martin Sundermeyer, Manuel Stoiber, Rudolph Triebel</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 15:36:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13241v3</guid></item></channel></rss>

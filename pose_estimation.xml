However, due to incomplete observation measurements andsparsity of the LiDAR point cloud, it is challenging to achieve satisfactorypose extraction based on 3D LiDAR by using the existing pose estimationmethods. In addition, the requirement for real-time performance furtherincreases the difficulty of the pose estimation task. In this paper, weproposed a novel convex hull-based vehicle pose estimation method. Theextracted 3D cluster is reduced to the convex hull, reducing the computationburden and retaining contour information. Then a novel criterion based on theminimum occlusion area is developed for the search-based algorithm, which canachieve accurate pose estimation. This criterion also makes the proposedalgorithm especially suitable for obstacle avoidance. The proposed algorithm isvalidated on the KITTI dataset and a manually labeled dataset acquired at anindustrial park. The results show that our proposed method can achieve betteraccuracy than the state-of-the-art pose estimation method while maintainingreal-time speed.</description><author>Ningning Ding</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2023 00:47:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01034v2</guid></item><item><title>Certifiable 3D Object Pose Estimation: Foundations, Learning Models, and Self-Training</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11215v4</link><description>We consider a certifiable object pose estimation problem, where -- given apartial point cloud of an object -- the goal is to not only estimate the objectpose, but also to provide a certificate of correctness for the resultingestimate. Our first contribution is a general theory of certification forend-to-end perception models. In particular, we introduce the notion of$\zeta$-correctness, which bounds the distance between an estimate and theground truth. We show that $\zeta$-correctness can be assessed by implementingtwo certificates: (i) a certificate of observable correctness, that asserts ifthe model output is consistent with the input data and prior information, (ii)a certificate of non-degeneracy, that asserts whether the input data issufficient to compute a unique estimate. Our second contribution is to applythis theory and design a new learning-based certifiable pose estimator. Wepropose C-3PO, a semantic-keypoint-based pose estimation model, augmented withthe two certificates, to solve the certifiable pose estimation problem. C-3POalso includes a keypoint corrector, implemented as a differentiableoptimization layer, that can correct large detection errors (e.g. due to thesim-to-real gap). Our third contribution is a novel self-supervised trainingapproach that uses our certificate of observable correctness to provide thesupervisory signal to C-3PO during training. In it, the model trains only onthe observably correct input-output pairs, in each training iteration. Astraining progresses, we see that the observably correct input-output pairsgrow, eventually reaching near 100% in many cases. Our experiments show that(i) standard semantic-keypoint-based methods outperform more recentalternatives, (ii) C-3PO further improves performance and significantlyoutperforms all the baselines, and (iii) C-3PO's certificates are able todiscern correct pose estimates.</description><author>Rajat Talak, Lisa Peng, Luca Carlone</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 20:47:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11215v4</guid></item><item><title>A Correct-and-Certify Approach to Self-Supervise Object Pose Estimators via Ensemble Self-Training</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06019v2</link><description>Real-world robotics applications demand object pose estimation methods thatwork reliably across a variety of scenarios. Modern learning-based approachesrequire large labeled datasets and tend to perform poorly outside the trainingdomain. Our first contribution is to develop a robust corrector module thatcorrects pose estimates using depth information, thus enabling existing methodsto better generalize to new test domains; the corrector operates on semantickeypoints (but is also applicable to other pose estimators) and is fullydifferentiable. Our second contribution is an ensemble self-training approachthat simultaneously trains multiple pose estimators in a self-supervisedmanner. Our ensemble self-training architecture uses the robust corrector torefine the output of each pose estimator; then, it evaluates the quality of theoutputs using observable correctness certificates; finally, it uses theobservably correct outputs for further training, without requiring externalsupervision. As an additional contribution, we propose small improvements to aregression-based keypoint detection architecture, to enhance its robustness tooutliers; these improvements include a robust pooling scheme and a robustcentroid computation. Experiments on the YCBV and TLESS datasets show theproposed ensemble self-training outperforms fully supervised baselines whilenot requiring 3D annotations on real data.</description><author>Jingnan Shi, Rajat Talak, Dominic Maggio, Luca Carlone</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 19:46:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06019v2</guid></item><item><title>Affine Correspondences between Multi-Camera Systems for Relative Pose Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12996v1</link><description>We present a novel method to compute the relative pose of multi-camerasystems using two affine correspondences (ACs). Existing solutions to themulti-camera relative pose estimation are either restricted to special cases ofmotion, have too high computational complexity, or require too many pointcorrespondences (PCs). Thus, these solvers impede an efficient or accuraterelative pose estimation when applying RANSAC as a robust estimator. This papershows that the 6DOF relative pose estimation problem using ACs permits afeasible minimal solution, when exploiting the geometric constraints betweenACs and multi-camera systems using a special parameterization. We present aproblem formulation based on two ACs that encompass two common types of ACsacross two views, i.e., inter-camera and intra-camera. Moreover, the frameworkfor generating the minimal solvers can be extended to solve various relativepose estimation problems, e.g., 5DOF relative pose estimation with knownrotation angle prior. Experiments on both virtual and real multi-camera systemsprove that the proposed solvers are more efficient than the state-of-the-artalgorithms, while resulting in a better relative pose accuracy.

Unlike generalhuman pose estimation, goalie pose estimation is much more complex as itinvolves not only the detection of keypoints corresponding to the joints of thegoalie concealed under thick padding and mask, but also a large number ofnon-human keypoints corresponding to the large leg pads and gloves worn, thestick, as well as the hockey net. To tackle this challenge, we introduceGoalieNet, a multi-stage deep neural network for jointly estimating the pose ofthe goalie, their equipment, and the net. Experimental results using NHLbenchmark data demonstrate that the proposed GoalieNet can achieve an averageof 84\% accuracy across all keypoints, where 22 out of 29 keypoints aredetected with more than 80\% accuracy. This indicates that such a joint poseestimation approach can be a promising research direction.</description><author>Marjan Shahi, David Clausi, Alexander Wong</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2023 02:00:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15853v1</guid></item><item><title>Mutual Information-Based Temporal Difference Learning for Human Pose Estimation in Video</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08475v2</link><description>Temporal modeling is crucial for multi-frame human pose estimation. Mostexisting methods directly employ optical flow or deformable convolution topredict full-spectrum motion fields, which might incur numerous irrelevantcues, such as a nearby person or background. Without further efforts toexcavate meaningful motion priors, their results are suboptimal, especially incomplicated spatiotemporal interactions. On the other hand, the temporaldifference has the ability to encode representative motion information whichcan potentially be valuable for pose estimation but has not been fullyexploited. In this paper, we present a novel multi-frame human pose estimationframework, which employs temporal differences across frames to model dynamiccontexts and engages mutual information objectively to facilitate useful motioninformation disentanglement. To be specific, we design a multi-stage TemporalDifference Encoder that performs incremental cascaded learning conditioned onmulti-stage feature difference sequences to derive informative motionrepresentation. We further propose a Representation Disentanglement module fromthe mutual information perspective, which can grasp discriminativetask-relevant motion signals by explicitly defining useful and noisyconstituents of the raw motion features and minimizing their mutualinformation.

Although most state-of-the-art methods exploit low-levelprimitives such as points or lines, the emergence of very effective CNN-basedobject detectors in the recent years has paved the way to the use ofhigher-level features carrying semantically meaningful information. Pioneeringworks in that direction have shown that modelling 3D objects by ellipsoids and2D detections by ellipses offers a convenient manner to link 2D and 3D data.However, the mathematical formalism most often used in the related litteraturedoes not enable to easily distinguish ellipsoids and ellipses from otherquadrics and conics, leading to a loss of specificity potentially detrimentalin some developments. Moreover, the linearization process of the projectionequation creates an over-representation of the camera parameters, also possiblycausing an efficiency loss. In this paper, we therefore introduce anellipsoid-specific theoretical framework and demonstrate its beneficialproperties in the context of pose estimation. More precisely, we first showthat the proposed formalism enables to reduce the pose estimation problem to aposition or orientation-only estimation problem in which the remaining unknownscan be derived in closed-form. Then, we demonstrate that it can be furtherreduced to a 1 Degree-of-Freedom (1DoF) problem and provide the analyticalderivations of the pose as a function of that unique scalar unknown. Weillustrate our theoretical considerations by visual examples and include adiscussion on the practical aspects. Finally, we release this paper along withthe corresponding source code in order to contribute towards more efficientresolutions of ellipsoid-related pose estimation problems.</description><author>Vincent Gaudillière, Gilles Simon, Marie-Odile Berger</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 13:09:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12513v3</guid></item><item><title>SPAC-Net: Synthetic Pose-aware Animal ControlNet for Enhanced Pose Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17845v1</link><description>Animal pose estimation has become a crucial area of research, but thescarcity of annotated data is a significant challenge in developing accuratemodels. Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative, but itfrequently exhibits domain discrepancies with real data. Style transferalgorithms have been proposed to address this issue, but they suffer frominsufficient spatial correspondence, leading to the loss of label information.In this work, we present a new approach called Synthetic Pose-aware AnimalControlNet (SPAC-Net), which incorporates ControlNet into the previouslyproposed Prior-Aware Synthetic animal data generation (PASyn) pipeline. Weleverage the plausible pose data generated by the Variational Auto-Encoder(VAE)-based data generation pipeline as input for the ControlNetHolistically-nested Edge Detection (HED) boundary task model to generatesynthetic data with pose labels that are closer to real data, making itpossible to train a high-precision pose estimation network without the need forreal data. In addition, we propose the Bi-ControlNet structure to separatelydetect the HED boundary of animals and backgrounds, improving the precision andstability of the generated data. Using the SPAC-Net pipeline, we generatesynthetic zebra and rhino images and test them on the AP10K real dataset,demonstrating superior performance compared to using only real images orsynthetic data generated by other methods. Our work demonstrates the potentialfor synthetic data to overcome the challenge of limited annotated data inanimal pose estimation.</description><author>Le Jiang, Sarah Ostadabbas</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 02:56:42 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17845v1</guid></item><item><title>A Survey on Deep Learning-Based Monocular Spacecraft Pose Estimation: Current State, Limitations and Prospects</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07348v3</link><description>Estimating the pose of an uncooperative spacecraft is an important computervision problem for enabling the deployment of automatic vision-based systems inorbit, with applications ranging from on-orbit servicing to space debrisremoval.

Inparticular, we study how pose can be estimated from force and tactile dataarising from contact. Using data derived from contact is challenging because itis inherently less information-dense than visual data, and thus the poseestimation problem is severely under-constrained when there are few contacts.Rather than attempting to estimate the true pose of the object, which is nottractable without a large number of contacts, we seek to estimate a plausibleset of poses which obey the constraints imposed by the sensor data. Existingmethods struggle to estimate this set because they are either designed forsingle pose estimates or require informative priors to be effective. Ourapproach to this problem, Constrained pose Hypothesis Set Elimination (CHSEL),has three key attributes: 1) It considers volumetric information, which allowsus to account for known free space; 2) It uses a novel differentiablevolumetric cost function to take advantage of powerful gradient-basedoptimization tools; and 3) It uses methods from the Quality Diversity (QD)optimization literature to produce a diverse set of high-quality poses. To ourknowledge, QD methods have not been used previously for pose registration. Wealso show how to update our plausible pose estimates online as more data isgathered by the robot. Our experiments suggest that CHSEL shows largeperformance improvements over several baseline methods for both simulated andreal-world data.</description><author>Sheng Zhong, Nima Fazeli, Dmitry Berenson</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2023 02:43:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08042v1</guid></item><item><title>Neural Voting Field for Camera-Space 3D Hand Pose Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04328v1</link><description>We present a unified framework for camera-space 3D hand pose estimation froma single RGB image based on 3D implicit representation. As opposed to recentworks, most of which first adopt holistic or pixel-level dense regression toobtain relative 3D hand pose and then follow with complex second-stageoperations for 3D global root or scale recovery, we propose a novel unified 3Ddense regression scheme to estimate camera-space 3D hand pose via dense 3Dpoint-wise voting in camera frustum. Through direct dense modeling in 3D domaininspired by Pixel-aligned Implicit Functions for 3D detailed reconstruction,our proposed Neural Voting Field (NVF) fully models 3D dense local evidence andhand global geometry, helping to alleviate common 2D-to-3D ambiguities.Specifically, for a 3D query point in camera frustum and its pixel-alignedimage feature, NVF, represented by a Multi-Layer Perceptron, regresses: (i) itssigned distance to the hand surface; (ii) a set of 4D offset vectors (1D votingweight and 3D directional vector to each hand joint). Following a vote-castingscheme, 4D offset vectors from near-surface points are selected to calculatethe 3D hand joint coordinates by a weighted average. Experiments demonstratethat NVF outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on FreiHAND datasetfor camera-space 3D hand pose estimation. We also adapt NVF to the classic taskof root-relative 3D hand pose estimation, for which NVF also obtainsstate-of-the-art results on HO3D dataset.</description><author>Lin Huang, Chung-Ching Lin, Kevin Lin, Lin Liang, Lijuan Wang, Junsong Yuan, Zicheng Liu</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2023 17:51:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04328v1</guid></item><item><title>Relation-Based Associative Joint Location for Human Pose Estimation in Videos</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03591v3</link><description>Video-based human pose estimation (VHPE) is a vital yet challenging task.While deep learning methods have made significant progress for the VHPE, mostapproaches to this task implicitly model the long-range interaction betweenjoints by enlarging the receptive field of the convolution. Unlike priormethods, we design a lightweight and plug-and-play joint relation extractor(JRE) to model the associative relationship between joints explicitly andautomatically. The JRE takes the pseudo heatmaps of joints as input andcalculates the similarity between pseudo heatmaps. In this way, the JREflexibly learns the relationship between any two joints, allowing it to learnthe rich spatial configuration of human poses. Moreover, the JRE can inferinvisible joints according to the relationship between joints, which isbeneficial for the model to locate occluded joints. Then, combined withtemporal semantic continuity modeling, we propose a Relation-based PoseSemantics Transfer Network (RPSTN) for video-based human pose estimation.Specifically, to capture the temporal dynamics of poses, the pose semanticinformation of the current frame is transferred to the next with a jointrelation guided pose semantics propagator (JRPSP). The proposed model cantransfer the pose semantic features from the non-occluded frame to the occludedframe, making our method robust to the occlusion. Furthermore, the proposed JREmodule is also suitable for image-based human pose estimation. The proposedRPSTN achieves state-of-the-art results on the video-based Penn Action dataset,Sub-JHMDB dataset, and PoseTrack2018 dataset.

These limitationsmainly come from the necessity of 3D models, closed-category detection, and alarge number of densely annotated support views. To mitigate this issue, wepropose a general paradigm for object pose estimation, called Promptable ObjectPose Estimation (POPE). The proposed approach POPE enables zero-shot 6DoFobject pose estimation for any target object in any scene, while only a singlereference is adopted as the support view. To achieve this, POPE leverages thepower of the pre-trained large-scale 2D foundation model, employs a frameworkwith hierarchical feature representation and 3D geometry principles. Moreover,it estimates the relative camera pose between object prompts and the targetobject in new views, enabling both two-view and multi-view 6DoF pose estimationtasks. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that POPE exhibitsunrivaled robust performance in zero-shot settings, by achieving a significantreduction in the averaged Median Pose Error by 52.38% and 50.47% on the LINEMODand OnePose datasets, respectively. We also conduct more challenging testingsin causally captured images (see Figure 1), which further demonstrates therobustness of POPE.

However, it usually suffers from a lack of generalization to newinstances and object types. Most widely used methods learn to infer the objectpose in a discriminative setup where the model filters useful information toinfer the exact pose of the object. While such methods offer accurate poses,the model does not store enough information to generalize to new objects. Inthis work, we address the generalization capability of pose estimation usingmodels that contain enough information about the object to render it indifferent poses. We follow the line of work that inverts neural renderers toinfer the pose. We propose i-$\sigma$SRN to maximize the information flowingfrom the input pose to the rendered scene and invert them to infer the posegiven an input image. Specifically, we extend Scene Representation Networks(SRNs) by incorporating a separate network for density estimation and introducea new way of obtaining a weighted scene representation.

However, this task becomes more challenging in poor lightingconditions or when dealing with textureless objects. To address this issue,depth images are becoming an increasingly popular choice due to theirinvariance to a scene's appearance and the implicit incorporation of essentialgeometric characteristics. However, fully leveraging depth information toimprove the performance of pose estimation remains a difficult andunder-investigated problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novelframework called SwinDePose, that uses only geometric information from depthimages to achieve accurate 6D pose estimation. SwinDePose first calculates theangles between each normal vector defined in a depth image and the threecoordinate axes in the camera coordinate system. The resulting angles are thenformed into an image, which is encoded using Swin Transformer. Additionally, weapply RandLA-Net to learn the representations from point clouds. The resultingimage and point clouds embeddings are concatenated and fed into a semanticsegmentation module and a 3D keypoints localization module. Finally, weestimate 6D poses using a least-square fitting approach based on the targetobject's predicted semantic mask and 3D keypoints. In experiments on theLineMod and Occlusion LineMod datasets, SwinDePose outperforms existingstate-of-the-art methods for 6D object pose estimation using depth images.

However, the quest for better performance stillpersists especially for accurate robotics manipulation. This quest extends tothe Agri-robotics domain. In this paper, we propose TransPose, an improvedTransformer-based 6D pose estimation with a depth refinement module. Thearchitecture takes in only an RGB image as input with no additionalsupplementing modalities such as depth or thermal images. The architectureencompasses an innovative lighter depth estimation network that estimates depthfrom an RGB image using feature pyramid with an up-sampling method. Atransformer-based detection network with additional prediction heads isproposed to directly regress the object's centre and predict the 6D pose of thetarget.

In order to bridge thisgap, we empirically explore key factors in pose estimation including paradigm,model architecture, training strategy, and deployment, and present ahigh-performance real-time multi-person pose estimation framework, RTMPose,based on MMPose. Our RTMPose-m achieves 75.8% AP on COCO with 90+ FPS on anIntel i7-11700 CPU and 430+ FPS on an NVIDIA GTX 1660 Ti GPU, and RTMPose-lachieves 67.0% AP on COCO-WholeBody with 130+ FPS. To further evaluateRTMPose's capability in critical real-time applications, we also report theperformance after deploying on the mobile device.

A critical aspect of thisinterpretation is pose estimation: inferring quantities that describe theposition and orientation of an object in 3D space. Most existing approaches topose estimation make limiting assumptions, often working only for specific,known object instances, or at best generalising to an object category usinglarge pose-labelled datasets. In this work, we present a method for achievingcategory-level pose estimation by inspection of just a single object from adesired category. We show that we can subsequently perform accurate poseestimation for unseen objects from an inspected category, and considerablyoutperform prior work by exploiting multi-view correspondences. We demonstratethat our method runs in real-time, enabling a robot manipulator equipped withan RGBD sensor to perform online 6D pose estimation for novel objects. Finally,we showcase our method in a continual learning setting, with a robot able todetermine whether objects belong to known categories, and if not, use activeperception to produce a one-shot category representation for subsequent poseestimation.</description><author>Walter Goodwin, Ioannis Havoutis, Ingmar Posner</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 02:32:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12626v1</guid></item><item><title>GLA-GCN: Global-local Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network for 3D Human</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05853v1</link><description>3D human pose estimation has been researched for decades with promisingfruits. 3D human pose lifting is one of the promising research directionstoward the task where both estimated pose and ground truth pose data are usedfor training. Existing pose lifting works mainly focus on improving theperformance of estimated pose, but they usually underperform when testing onthe ground truth pose data. We observe that the performance of the estimatedpose can be easily improved by preparing good quality 2D pose, such asfine-tuning the 2D pose or using advanced 2D pose detectors. As such, weconcentrate on improving the 3D human pose lifting via ground truth data forthe future improvement of more quality estimated pose data. Towards this goal,a simple yet effective model called Global-local Adaptive Graph ConvolutionalNetwork (GLA-GCN) is proposed in this work. Our GLA-GCN globally models thespatiotemporal structure via a graph representation and backtraces local jointfeatures for 3D human pose estimation via individually connected layers. Tovalidate our model design, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmarkdatasets: Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP. Experimental results showthat our GLA-GCN implemented with ground truth 2D poses significantlyoutperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., up to around 3%, 17%, and 13% errorreductions on Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP, respectively).</description><author>Bruce X.

Existing methods primarily focus on pair-wise interaction ofbody joints, which is insufficient for scenarios involving overlapping jointsand rapidly changing poses. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novelapproach, the High-order Directed Transformer (HDFormer), which leverageshigh-order bone and joint relationships for improved pose estimation.Specifically, HDFormer incorporates both self-attention and high-orderattention to formulate a multi-order attention module. This module facilitatesfirst-order "joint$\leftrightarrow$joint", second-order"bone$\leftrightarrow$joint", and high-order "hyperbone$\leftrightarrow$joint"interactions, effectively addressing issues in complex and occlusion-heavysituations. In addition, modern CNN techniques are integrated into thetransformer-based architecture, balancing the trade-off between performance andefficiency. HDFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) modelson Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, requiring only 1/10 of the parametersand significantly lower computational costs.

However, mostof these methods tend to focus on learning relationships between body joints ofthe skeleton using first-order neighbors, ignoring higher-order neighbors andhence limiting their ability to exploit relationships between distant joints.In this paper, we introduce a higher-order regular splitting graph network(RS-Net) for 2D-to-3D human pose estimation using matrix splitting inconjunction with weight and adjacency modulation. The core idea is to capturelong-range dependencies between body joints using multi-hop neighborhoods andalso to learn different modulation vectors for different body joints as well asa modulation matrix added to the adjacency matrix associated to the skeleton.This learnable modulation matrix helps adjust the graph structure by addingextra graph edges in an effort to learn additional connections between bodyjoints. Instead of using a shared weight matrix for all neighboring bodyjoints, the proposed RS-Net model applies weight unsharing before aggregatingthe feature vectors associated to the joints in order to capture the differentrelations between them.

To improve the accuracyof the estimated pose, state-of-the-art approaches in 6D object pose estimationuse observational data from one or more modalities, e.g., RGB images, depth,and tactile readings. However, existing approaches make limited use of theunderlying geometric structure of the object captured by these modalities,thereby, increasing their reliance on visual features. This results in poorperformance when presented with objects that lack such visual features or whenvisual features are simply occluded. Furthermore, current approaches do nottake advantage of the proprioceptive information embedded in the position ofthe fingers. To address these limitations, in this paper: (1) we introduce ahierarchical graph neural network architecture for combining multimodal (visionand touch) data that allows for a geometrically informed 6D object poseestimation, (2) we introduce a hierarchical message passing operation thatflows the information within and across modalities to learn a graph-basedobject representation, and (3) we introduce a method that accounts for theproprioceptive information for in-hand object representation. We evaluate ourmodel on a diverse subset of objects from the YCB Object and Model Set, andshow that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art workin accuracy and robustness to occlusion.

From the statisticalpoint of view, those additional processes for identifying instances arenecessary to bypass learning the high-dimensional joint distribution of humankeypoints, which is a critical factor for another major challenge, theocclusion scenario. In this work, we propose a novel framework of single-stageinstance-aware pose estimation by modeling the joint distribution of humankeypoints with a mixture density model, termed as MDPose.

Once a target location has been reached, drones do not have toremain active during the mission. It is possible for the vehicle to perch andstop its motors in such situations to conserve energy, as well as maintain astatic position in unfavorable flying conditions. In the perching targetestimation phase, the steady and accuracy of a visual camera with markers is asignificant challenge. It is rapidly detectable from afar when using a largemarker, but when the drone approaches, it quickly disappears as out of cameraview. In this paper, a vision-based target poses estimation method usingmultiple markers is proposed to deal with the above-mentioned problems. First,a perching target with a small marker inside a larger one is designed toimprove detection capability at wide and close ranges. Second, the relativeposes of the flying vehicle are calculated from detected markers using amonocular camera. Next, a Kalman filter is applied to provide a more stable andreliable pose estimation, especially when the measurement data is missing dueto unexpected reasons. Finally, we introduced an algorithm for merging theposes data from multi markers. The poses are then sent to the positioncontroller to align the drone and the marker's center and steer it to perch onthe target. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness andfeasibility of the adopted approach. The drone can perch successfully onto thecenter of the markers with the attached 25mm-diameter rounded magnet.</description><author>Truong-Dong Do, Nguyen Xuan-Mung, Sung-Kyung Hong</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 17:51:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14838v1</guid></item><item><title>Human Body Pose Estimation for Gait Identification: A Comprehensive Survey of Datasets and Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13765v1</link><description>Person identification is a problem that has received substantial attention,particularly in security domains.

Conventional pose estimation algorithms fail on smooth orself-similar scenes, while methods performing inverse rendering from unposedviews require a rough initialization of the camera orientations. The maindifficulty of pose estimation lies in real-life objects being almost invariantunder certain transformations, making the photometric distance between renderedviews non-convex with respect to the camera parameters.

Thanks to prior deformation, whichexplicitly adapts a category-specific 3D prior (i.e., a 3D template) to a givenobject instance, prior-based methods attained great success and have become amajor research stream. However, obtaining category-specific priors requirescollecting a large amount of 3D models, which is labor-consuming and often notaccessible in practice. This motivates us to investigate whether priors arenecessary to make prior-based methods effective. Our empirical study shows thatthe 3D prior itself is not the credit to the high performance. The keypointactually is the explicit deformation process, which aligns camera and worldcoordinates supervised by world-space 3D models (also called canonical space).Inspired by these observations, we introduce a simple prior-free implicit spacetransformation network, namely IST-Net, to transform camera-space features toworld-space counterparts and build correspondence between them in an implicitmanner without relying on 3D priors. Besides, we design camera- and world-spaceenhancers to enrich the features with pose-sensitive information andgeometrical constraints, respectively.

Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has been proven inherently suitable tomodel the human skeletal topology. However, current GCN-based 3D HPE methodsupdate the node features by aggregating their neighbors' information withoutconsidering the interaction of joints in different motion patterns. Althoughsome studies import limb information to learn the movement patterns, the latentsynergies among joints, such as maintaining balance in the motion are seldominvestigated. We propose a hop-wise GraphFormer with intragroup jointrefinement (HopFIR) to tackle the 3D HPE problem. The HopFIR mainly consists ofa novel Hop-wise GraphFormer(HGF) module and an Intragroup JointRefinement(IJR) module which leverages the prior limb information forperipheral joints refinement. The HGF module groups the joints by $k$-hopneighbors and utilizes a hop-wise transformer-like attention mechanism amongthese groups to discover latent joint synergy. Extensive experimental resultsshow that HopFIR outperforms the SOTA methods with a large margin (on theHuman3.6M dataset, the mean per joint position error (MPJPE) is 32.67mm).Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that previous SOTA GCN-based methods canbenefit from the proposed hop-wise attention mechanism efficiently withsignificant performance promotion, such as SemGCN and MGCN are improved by 8.9%and 4.5%, respectively.</description><author>Kai Zhai, Qiang Nie, Bo Ouyang, Xiang Li, ShanLin Yang</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2023 17:07:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14581v2</guid></item><item><title>Improving 2D Human Pose Estimation across Unseen Camera Views with Synthetic Data</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06737v1</link><description>Human Pose Estimation is a thoroughly researched problem; however, mostdatasets focus on the side and front-view scenarios.

In thispaper, we propose MPM, a unified 2D-3D human pose representation framework viamasked pose modeling. We treat 2D and 3D poses as two different modalities likevision and language and build a single-stream transformer-based architecture.We apply three pretext tasks, which are masked 2D pose modeling, masked 3D posemodeling, and masked 2D pose lifting to pre-train our network and usefull-supervision to perform further fine-tuning. A high masking ratio of 72.5%in total with a spatio-temporal mask sampling strategy leading to betterrelation modeling both in spatial and temporal domains.

Under the status quo, acquiring such annotated 3D handposes is challenging, e.g., due to the difficulty of 3D annotation and thepresence of occlusion. To reveal this problem, we review the pros and cons ofexisting annotation methods classified as manual, synthetic-model-based,hand-sensor-based, and computational approaches.

Consequently, there is growinginterest in extending NeRF models to jointly optimize camera poses and scenerepresentation, which offers an alternative to off-the-shelf SfM pipelineswhich have well-understood failure modes. Existing approaches for unposed NeRFoperate under limited assumptions, such as a prior pose distribution or coarsepose initialization, making them less effective in a general setting. In thiswork, we propose a novel approach, LU-NeRF, that jointly estimates camera posesand neural radiance fields with relaxed assumptions on pose configuration. Ourapproach operates in a local-to-global manner, where we first optimize overlocal subsets of the data, dubbed mini-scenes. LU-NeRF estimates local pose andgeometry for this challenging few-shot task. The mini-scene poses are broughtinto a global reference frame through a robust pose synchronization step, wherea final global optimization of pose and scene can be performed. We show ourLU-NeRF pipeline outperforms prior attempts at unposed NeRF without makingrestrictive assumptions on the pose prior. This allows us to operate in thegeneral SE(3) pose setting, unlike the baselines. Our results also indicate ourmodel can be complementary to feature-based SfM pipelines as it comparesfavorably to COLMAP on low-texture and low-resolution images.</description><author>Zezhou Cheng, Carlos Esteves, Varun Jampani, Abhishek Kar, Subhransu Maji, Ameesh Makadia</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 18:56:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05410v1</guid></item><item><title>Occlusion Robust 3D Human Pose Estimation with StridedPoseGraphFormer and Data Augmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12069v1</link><description>Occlusion is an omnipresent challenge in 3D human pose estimation (HPE).

In real-world scenarios, however, we are met withchallenging visual conditions, coarticulated signing, small datasets, and theneed for signer independent models. To tackle this difficult problem, werequire a robust feature extractor to process the sign language videos. Onecould expect human pose estimators to be ideal candidates. However, due to adomain mismatch with their training sets and challenging poses in signlanguage, they lack robustness on sign language data and image based modelsoften still outperform keypoint based models. Furthermore, whereas the commonpractice of transfer learning with image based models yields even higheraccuracy, keypoint based models are typically trained from scratch on every SLRdataset. These factors limit their usefulness for SLR. From the existingliterature, it is also not clear which, if any, pose estimator performs bestfor SLR. We compare the three most popular pose estimators for SLR: OpenPose,MMPose and MediaPipe. We show that through keypoint normalization, missingkeypoint imputation, and learning a pose embedding, we can obtain significantlybetter results and enable transfer learning. We show that keypoint-basedembeddings contain cross-lingual features: they can transfer between signlanguages and achieve competitive performance even when fine-tuning only theclassifier layer of an SLR model on a target sign language. We furthermoreachieve better performance using fine-tuned transferred embeddings than modelstrained only on the target sign language.

Although many hand-designed soft functions have been proposedas gradient estimators to better approximate gradients, their mechanism is notclear and there are still huge performance gaps between binary models and theirfull-precision counterparts. To address these issues and reduce gradient error,we propose to tackle network binarization as a binary classification problemand use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as the classifier in the forward passand gradient estimator in the backward pass. Benefiting from the MLP'stheoretical capability to fit any continuous function, it can be adaptivelylearned to binarize networks and backpropagate gradients without any priorknowledge of soft functions. From this perspective, we further empiricallyjustify that even a simple linear function can outperform previous complex softfunctions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yieldssurprising performance both in image classification and human pose estimationtasks. Specifically, we achieve $65.7\%$ top-1 accuracy of ResNet-34 onImageNet dataset, with an absolute improvement of $2.6\%$.

Instead, in this work, we explore the feasibility of estimating body poseusing IMUs already in devices that many users own -- namely smartphones,smartwatches, and earbuds. This approach has several challenges, includingnoisy data from low-cost commodity IMUs, and the fact that the number ofinstrumentation points on a users body is both sparse and in flux. Our pipelinereceives whatever subset of IMU data is available, potentially from just asingle device, and produces a best-guess pose.

However,these methods present rotation semantic ambiguity, rotation error accumulation,and shape estimation overfitting, which also leads to errors in the estimatedpose. Additionally, these methods have not efficiently leveraged theadvancements in another hot topic, human pose estimation. To address theseissues, we propose a novel approach, Decomposition of 3D Rotation and Lift from2D Joint to 3D mesh (D3L). We disentangle 3D joint rotation into bone directionand bone twist direction so that the human mesh recovery task is broken downinto estimation of pose, twist, and shape, which can be handled independently.Then we design a 2D-to-3D lifting network for estimating twist direction and 3Djoint position from 2D joint position sequences and introduce a nonlinearoptimization method for fitting shape parameters and bone directions. Ourapproach can leverage human pose estimation methods, and avoid pose errorsintroduced by shape estimation overfitting. We conduct experiments on theHuman3.6M dataset and demonstrate improved performance compared to existingmethods by a large margin.</description><author>Xiaoyang Hao, Han Li, Jun Cheng, Lei Wang</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jun 2023 11:41:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06406v1</guid></item><item><title>Digital Twin-Based 3D Map Management for Edge-Assisted Mobile Augmented Reality</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16571v1</link><description>In this paper, we design a 3D map management scheme for edge-assisted mobileaugmented reality (MAR) to support the pose estimation of individual MARdevice, which uploads camera frames to an edge server. Our objective is tominimize the pose estimation uncertainty of the MAR device by periodicallyselecting a proper set of camera frames for uploading to update the 3D map. Toaddress the challenges of the dynamic uplink data rate and the time-varyingpose of the MAR device, we propose a digital twin (DT)-based approach to 3D mapmanagement. First, a DT is created for the MAR device, which emulates 3D mapmanagement based on predicting subsequent camera frames. Second, a model-basedreinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithm is developed, utilizing the datacollected from both the actual and the emulated data to manage the 3D map. Withextensive emulated data provided by the DT, the MBRL algorithm can quicklyprovide an adaptive map management policy in a highly dynamic environment.Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DT-based 3D map managementoutperforms benchmark schemes by achieving lower pose estimation uncertaintyand higher data efficiency in dynamic environments.</description><author>Conghao Zhou, Jie Gao, Mushu Li, Nan Cheng, Xuemin Shen, Weihua Zhuang</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 02:38:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16571v1</guid></item><item><title>CLAMP: Prompt-based Contrastive Learning for Connecting Language and Animal Pose</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11752v3</link><description>Animal pose estimation is challenging for existing image-based methodsbecause of limited training data and large intra- and inter-species variances.Motivated by the progress of visual-language research, we propose thatpre-trained language models (e.g., CLIP) can facilitate animal pose estimationby providing rich prior knowledge for describing animal keypoints in text.However, we found that building effective connections between pre-trainedlanguage models and visual animal keypoints is non-trivial since the gapbetween text-based descriptions and keypoint-based visual features about animalpose can be significant.

Despite its significance,existing works mostly assume that humans interact with rigid objects using onlya few body parts, limiting their scope. In this paper, we address thechallenging problem of f-AHOI, wherein the whole human bodies interact witharticulated objects, whose parts are connected by movable joints. We presentCHAIRS, a large-scale motion-captured f-AHOI dataset, consisting of 16.2 hoursof versatile interactions between 46 participants and 81 articulated and rigidsittable objects. CHAIRS provides 3D meshes of both humans and articulatedobjects during the entire interactive process, as well as realistic andphysically plausible full-body interactions. We show the value of CHAIRS withobject pose estimation. By learning the geometrical relationships in HOI, wedevise the very first model that leverage human pose estimation to tackle theestimation of articulated object poses and shapes during whole-bodyinteractions. Given an image and an estimated human pose, our model firstreconstructs the pose and shape of the object, then optimizes thereconstruction according to a learned interaction prior. Under both evaluationsettings (e.g., with or without the knowledge of objects'geometries/structures), our model significantly outperforms baselines.

We consider an active shapemodel, where -for an object category- we are given a library of potential CADmodels describing objects in that category, and we adopt a standard formulationwhere pose and shape are estimated from 2D or 3D keypoints via non-convexoptimization. Our first contribution is to develop PACE3D* and PACE2D*, thefirst certifiably optimal solvers for pose and shape estimation using 3D and 2Dkeypoints, respectively.

However,existing methods for 6DoF pose estimation often depend on CAD templates ordense support views, restricting their usefulness in realworld situations. Inthis study, we present a new cascade framework named Cas6D for few-shot 6DoFpose estimation that is generalizable and uses only RGB images. To address thefalse positives of target object detection in the extreme few-shot setting, ourframework utilizes a selfsupervised pre-trained ViT to learn robust featurerepresentations. Then, we initialize the nearest top-K pose candidates based onsimilarity score and refine the initial poses using feature pyramids toformulate and update the cascade warped feature volume, which encodes contextat increasingly finer scales. By discretizing the pose search range usingmultiple pose bins and progressively narrowing the pose search range in eachstage using predictions from the previous stage, Cas6D can overcome the largegap between pose candidates and ground truth poses, which is a common failuremode in sparse-view scenarios. Experimental results on the LINEMOD and GenMOPdatasets demonstrate that Cas6D outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 9.2%and 3.8% accuracy (Proj-5) under the 32-shot setting compared to OnePose++ andGen6D.</description><author>Panwang Pan, Zhiwen Fan, Brandon Y.

This process is repeated to incrementally refinethe estimate at each iteration. The DeepRM architecture incorporates LSTM unitsto propagate information through each refinement step, significantly improvingoverall performance. In contrast to current 2-stage Perspective-n-Point basedsolutions, DeepRM is trained end-to-end, and uses a scalable backbone that canbe tuned via a single parameter for accuracy and efficiency.

Recently,detector-free local feature matchers based on transformers have shown promisingresults, which largely outperform pure Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) basedones. But correlations produced by transformer-based methods are spatiallylimited to the center of source views' coarse patches, because of the costlyattention learning. In this work, we rethink this issue and find that suchmatching formulation degrades pose estimation, especially for low-resolutionimages. So we propose a transformer-based cascade matching model -- Cascadefeature Matching TRansformer (CasMTR), to efficiently learn dense featurecorrelations, which allows us to choose more reliable matching pairs for therelative pose estimation. Instead of re-training a new detector, we use asimple yet effective Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) post-process to filterkeypoints through the confidence map, and largely improve the matchingprecision.

This requiresactor-specific pose estimation (e.g., humans vs. animals), leading tocumbersome model design complexity and high maintenance costs. Moreover, theyoften focus on learning the visual modality alone and single-labelclassification whilst neglecting other available information sources (e.g.,class name text) and the concurrent occurrence of multiple actions. To overcomethese limitations, we propose a new approach called 'actor-agnostic multi-modalmulti-label action recognition,' which offers a unified solution for varioustypes of actors, including humans and animals. We further formulate a novelMulti-modal Semantic Query Network (MSQNet) model in a transformer-based objectdetection framework (e.g., DETR), characterized by leveraging visual andtextual modalities to represent the action classes better. The elimination ofactor-specific model designs is a key advantage, as it removes the need foractor pose estimation altogether. Extensive experiments on five publiclyavailable benchmarks show that our MSQNet consistently outperforms the priorarts of actor-specific alternatives on human and animal single- and multi-labelaction recognition tasks by up to 50%.

Common challenges include occlusions, theinherent ambiguities in the 2D to 3D mapping and the computational complexityof video processing. Existing methods ignore the ambiguities of thereconstruction and provide a single deterministic estimate for the 3D pose. Inorder to address these issues, we present a Temporal Attention basedProbabilistic human pose and shape Estimation method (TAPE) that operates on anRGB video. More specifically, we propose to use a neural network to encodevideo frames to temporal features using an attention-based neural network.Given these features, we output a per-frame but temporally-informed probabilitydistribution for the human pose using Normalizing Flows. We show that TAPEoutperforms state-of-the-art methods in standard benchmarks and serves as aneffective video-based prior for optimization-based human pose and shapeestimation.

Recent approachespredict a probability distribution over plausible 3D pose and shape parametersconditioned on the image. We show that these approaches exhibit a trade-offbetween three key properties: (i) accuracy - the likelihood of the ground-truth3D solution under the predicted distribution, (ii) sample-input consistency -the extent to which 3D samples from the predicted distribution match thevisible 2D image evidence, and (iii) sample diversity - the range of plausible3D solutions modelled by the predicted distribution. Our method, HuManiFlow,predicts simultaneously accurate, consistent and diverse distributions. We usethe human kinematic tree to factorise full body pose into ancestor-conditionedper-body-part pose distributions in an autoregressive manner. Per-body-partdistributions are implemented using normalising flows that respect the manifoldstructure of SO(3), the Lie group of per-body-part poses. We show thatill-posed, but ubiquitous, 3D point estimate losses reduce sample diversity,and employ only probabilistic training losses.

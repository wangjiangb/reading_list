This paper presents MANGO, a methodology for distillinghigh-accuracy, high-recall assertions of cultural knowledge. We judiciously anditeratively prompt LLMs for this purpose from two entry points, concepts andcultures. Outputs are consolidated via clustering and generative summarization.Running the MANGO method with GPT-3.5 as underlying LLM yields 167Khigh-accuracy assertions for 30K concepts and 11K cultures, surpassing priorresources by a large margin in quality and size. In an extrinsic evaluation forintercultural dialogues, we explore augmenting dialogue systems with culturalknowledge assertions. Notably, despite LLMs inherently possessing culturalknowledge, we find that adding knowledge from MANGO improves the overallquality, specificity, and cultural sensitivity of dialogue responses, as judgedby human annotators.

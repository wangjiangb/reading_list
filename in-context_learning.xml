The precise nature of LLMcapabilities is often mysterious, and different prompts can elicit differentcapabilities through in-context learning. We propose a framework that enablesus to analyze in-context learning dynamics to understand latent conceptsunderlying LLMs' behavioral patterns. This provides a more nuancedunderstanding than success-or-failure evaluation benchmarks, but does notrequire observing internal activations as a mechanistic interpretation ofcircuits would. Inspired by the cognitive science of human randomnessperception, we use random binary sequences as context and study dynamics ofin-context learning by manipulating properties of context data, such assequence length. In the latest GPT-3.5+ models, we find emergent abilities togenerate seemingly random numbers and learn basic formal languages, withstriking in-context learning dynamics where model outputs transition sharplyfrom seemingly random behaviors to deterministic repetition.</description><author>Eric J.

Toovercome these limitations, we propose an alternative approach that recastsin-context learning as in-context vectors (ICV). Using ICV has two steps. Wefirst use a forward pass on demonstration examples to create the in-contextvector from the latent embedding of the LLM. This vector captures essentialinformation about the intended task. On a new query, instead of addingdemonstrations to the prompt, we shift the latent states of the LLM using theICV. The ICV approach has several benefits: 1) it enables the LLM to moreeffectively follow the demonstration examples; 2) it's easy to control byadjusting the magnitude of the ICV; 3) it reduces the length of the prompt byremoving the in-context demonstrations; 4) ICV is computationally much moreefficient than fine-tuning. We demonstrate that ICV achieves better performancecompared to standard in-context learning and fine-tuning on diverse tasksincluding safety, style transfer, role-playing and formatting. Moreover, weshow that we can flexibly teach LLM to simultaneously follow different types ofinstructions by simple vector arithmetics on the corresponding ICVs.</description><author>Sheng Liu, Haotian Ye, Lei Xing, James Zou</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 22:37:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06668v3</guid></item><item><title>The Impact of Demonstrations on Multilingual In-Context Learning: A Multidimensional Analysis</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12976v1</link><description>In-context learning is a popular inference strategy where large languagemodels solve a task using only a few labelled demonstrations without needingany parameter updates. Compared to work on monolingual (English) in-contextlearning, multilingual in-context learning is under-explored, and we lack anin-depth understanding of the role of demonstrations in this context. Toaddress this gap, we conduct a multidimensional analysis of multilingualin-context learning, experimenting with 5 models from different model families,9 datasets covering classification and generation tasks, and 56 typologicallydiverse languages. Our results reveal that the effectiveness of demonstrationsvaries significantly across models, tasks, and languages. We also find thatLlama 2-Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 are largely insensitive to the quality ofdemonstrations. Instead, a carefully crafted template often eliminates thebenefits of demonstrations for some tasks and languages altogether. Thesefindings show that the importance of demonstrations might be overestimated.

Exploring the Relationship Between Model Architecture and In-Context Learning Ability</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08049v3</link><description>What is the relationship between model architecture and the ability toperform in-context learning? In this empirical study, we take the first stepstoward answering this question. We evaluate thirteen model architecturescapable of causal language modeling across a suite of synthetic in-contextlearning tasks. These selected architectures represent a broad range ofparadigms, including recurrent and convolution-based neural networks,transformers, state space model inspired, and other emerging attentionalternatives. We discover that all the considered architectures can performin-context learning under a wider range of conditions than previouslydocumented. Additionally, we observe stark differences in statisticalefficiency and consistency by varying the number of in-context examples andtask difficulty. We also measure each architecture's predisposition towardsin-context learning when presented with the option to memorize rather thanleverage in-context examples. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, we find thatseveral attention alternatives are sometimes competitive with or betterin-context learners than transformers. However, no single architecturedemonstrates consistency across all tasks, with performance either plateauingor declining when confronted with a significantly larger number of in-contextexamples than those encountered during gradient-based training.</description><author>Ivan Lee, Nan Jiang, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 02:54:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08049v3</guid></item><item><title>Understanding In-Context Learning from Repetitions</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00297v3</link><description>This paper explores the elusive mechanism underpinning in-context learning inLarge Language Models (LLMs).

The recent progress in large-scale generativemodels has further expanded their use in real-world language applications.However, the critical challenge of improving the generalizability andfactuality of LLMs in natural language understanding and question answeringremains under-explored. While previous in-context learning research has focusedon enhancing models to adhere to users' specific instructions and qualityexpectations, and to avoid undesired outputs, little to no work has exploredthe use of task-Specific fine-tuned Language Models (SLMs) to improve LLMs'in-context learning during the inference stage. Our primary contribution is theestablishment of a simple yet effective framework that enhances the reliabilityof LLMs as it: 1) generalizes out-of-distribution data, 2) elucidates how LLMsbenefit from discriminative models, and 3) minimizes hallucinations ingenerative tasks. Using our proposed plug-in method, enhanced versions of Llama2 and ChatGPT surpass their original versions regarding generalizability andfactuality.

In this paper, we addressthe limitation above by 1) introducing vision-language Model with Multi-ModalIn-Context Learning(MMICL), a new approach to allow the VLM to deal withmulti-modal inputs efficiently; 2) proposing a novel context scheme to augmentthe in-context learning ability of the VLM; 3) constructing the Multi-modalIn-Context Learning (MIC) dataset, designed to enhance the VLM's ability tounderstand complex multi-modal prompts. Our experiments confirm that MMICLachieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on a wide range of generalvision-language tasks, especially for complex benchmarks, including MME andMMBench. Our analysis demonstrates that MMICL effectively tackles the challengeof complex multi-modal prompt understanding and emerges the impressive ICLability. Furthermore, we observe that MMICL successfully alleviates languagebias in VLMs, a common issue for VLMs that often leads to hallucination whenfaced with extensive textual context.

We aim to close these gaps by proposing atheoretical framework, the Pelican Soup Framework. In this framework, weintroduce (1) the notion of a common sense knowledge base, (2) a generalformalism for natural language classification tasks, and the notion of (3)meaning association. Under this framework, we can establish a$\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ loss bound for in-context learning, where $T$ is the numberof example-label pairs in the demonstration. Compared with previous works, ourbound reflects the effect of the choice of verbalizers and the effect ofinstruction tuning. An additional notion of \textit{atom concepts} makes ourframework possible to explain the generalization to tasks unseen in thelanguage model training data. Finally, we propose a toy setup, Calcutec, and adigit addition task that mimics types of distribution shifts a model needs toovercome to perform in-context learning.

Although researchers are exploring the use offew-shot information extraction through in-context learning with LLMs, theytend to focus only on using correct or positive examples for demonstration,neglecting the potential value of incorporating incorrect or negative examplesinto the learning process. In this paper, we present c-ICL, a novel few-shottechnique that leverages both correct and incorrect sample constructions tocreate in-context learning demonstrations. This approach enhances the abilityof LLMs to extract entities and relations by utilizing prompts that incorporatenot only the positive samples but also the reasoning behind them. This methodallows for the identification and correction of potential interface errors.Specifically, our proposed method taps into the inherent contextual informationand valuable information in hard negative samples and the nearest positiveneighbors to the test and then applies the in-context learning demonstrationsbased on LLMs. Our experiments on various datasets indicate that c-ICLoutperforms previous few-shot in-context learning methods, deliveringsubstantial enhancements in performance across a broad spectrum of relatedtasks.

Despite being widely applied, in-context learning isvulnerable to malicious attacks. In this work, we raise security concernsregarding this paradigm. Our studies demonstrate that an attacker canmanipulate the behavior of large language models by poisoning the demonstrationcontext, without the need for fine-tuning the model. Specifically, we design anew backdoor attack method, named ICLAttack, to target large language modelsbased on in-context learning. Our method encompasses two types of attacks:poisoning demonstration examples and poisoning demonstration prompts, which canmake models behave in alignment with predefined intentions. ICLAttack does notrequire additional fine-tuning to implant a backdoor, thus preserving themodel's generality. Furthermore, the poisoned examples are correctly labeled,enhancing the natural stealth of our attack method. Extensive experimentalresults across several language models, ranging in size from 1.3B to 180Bparameters, demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack method, exemplified bya high average attack success rate of 95.0% across the three datasets on OPTmodels.</description><author>Shuai Zhao, Meihuizi Jia, Luu Anh Tuan, Fengjun Pan, Jinming Wen</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 13:45:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05949v4</guid></item><item><title>RAVEN: In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07922v2</link><description>In this paper, we investigate the in-context learning ability ofretrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models.

A promising avenue for guiding LLMs in intricatereasoning tasks involves the utilization of intermediate reasoning steps withinthe Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm. Nevertheless, the central challenge liesin the effective selection of exemplars for facilitating in-context learning.In this study, we introduce a framework that leverages Dual Queries andLow-rank approximation Re-ranking (DQ-LoRe) to automatically select exemplarsfor in-context learning. Dual Queries first query LLM to obtain LLM-generatedknowledge such as CoT, then query the retriever to obtain the final exemplarsvia both question and the knowledge. Moreover, for the second query, LoReemploys dimensionality reduction techniques to refine exemplar selection,ensuring close alignment with the input question's knowledge. Through extensiveexperiments, we demonstrate that DQ-LoRe significantly outperforms priorstate-of-the-art methods in the automatic selection of exemplars for GPT-4,enhancing performance from 92.5% to 94.2%. Our comprehensive analysis furtherreveals that DQ-LoRe consistently outperforms retrieval-based approaches interms of both performance and adaptability, especially in scenarioscharacterized by distribution shifts.

To gain a better understanding of LLMs, we conducta detailed analysis of the operations of attention heads and aim to betterunderstand the in-context learning of LLMs. Specifically, we investigatewhether attention heads encode two types of relationships between tokenspresent in natural languages: the syntactic dependency parsed from sentencesand the relation within knowledge graphs. We find that certain attention headsexhibit a pattern where, when attending to head tokens, they recall tail tokensand increase the output logits of those tail tokens.

The study ofsemantic attention heads advances our understanding of the intricate operationsof attention heads in transformers, and further provides new insights into thein-context learning of LLMs.</description><author>Jie Ren, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Dongrui Liu, Xipeng Qiu, Dahua Lin</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 14:43:39 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13055v1</guid></item><item><title>Dual Operating Modes of In-Context Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18819v1</link><description>In-context learning (ICL) exhibits dual operating modes: task learning, i.e.,acquiring a new skill from in-context samples, and task retrieval, i.e.,locating and activating a relevant pretrained skill. Recent theoretical workinvestigates various mathematical models to analyze ICL, but existing modelsexplain only one operating mode at a time. We introduce a probabilistic model,with which one can explain the dual operating modes of ICL simultaneously.Focusing on in-context learning of linear functions, we extend existing modelsfor pretraining data by introducing multiple task groups and task-dependentinput distributions. We then analyze the behavior of the optimally pretrainedmodel under the squared loss, i.e., the MMSE estimator of the label givenin-context examples. Regarding pretraining task distribution as prior andin-context examples as the observation, we derive the closed-form expression ofthe task posterior distribution. With the closed-form expression, we obtain aquantitative understanding of the two operating modes of ICL. Furthermore, weshed light on an unexplained phenomenon observed in practice: under certainsettings, the ICL risk initially increases and then decreases with morein-context examples. Our model offers a plausible explanation for this "earlyascent" phenomenon: a limited number of in-context samples may lead to theretrieval of an incorrect skill, thereby increasing the risk, which willeventually diminish as task learning takes effect with more in-context samples.We also theoretically analyze ICL with biased labels, e.g., zero-shot ICL,where in-context examples are assigned random labels. Lastly, we validate ourfindings and predictions via experiments involving Transformers and largelanguage models.</description><author>Ziqian Lin, Kangwook Lee</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 03:06:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18819v1</guid></item><item><title>SQL-Encoder: Improving NL2SQL In-Context Learning Through a Context-Aware Encoder</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16204v1</link><description>Detecting structural similarity between queries is essential for selectingexamples in in-context learning models.

In this work, seeking data efficiency,we design unsupervised pretraining and in-context learning methods for PDEoperator learning. To reduce the need for training data with simulatedsolutions, we pretrain neural operators on unlabeled PDE data usingreconstruction-based proxy tasks.

However, the current research fails toadequately address the prediction of mental health conditions from social mediadata in low-resource African languages like Swahili. This study introduces twodistinct approaches utilising model-agnostic meta-learning and leveraging largelanguage models (LLMs) to address this gap. Experiments are conducted on threedatasets translated to low-resource language and applied to four mental healthtasks, which include stress, depression, depression severity and suicidalideation prediction. we first apply a meta-learning model withself-supervision, which results in improved model initialisation for rapidadaptation and cross-lingual transfer. The results show that our meta-trainedmodel performs significantly better than standard fine-tuning methods,outperforming the baseline fine-tuning in macro F1 score with 18\% and 0.8\%over XLM-R and mBERT. In parallel, we use LLMs' in-context learningcapabilities to assess their performance accuracy across the Swahili mentalhealth prediction tasks by analysing different cross-lingual promptingapproaches. Our analysis showed that Swahili prompts performed better thancross-lingual prompts but less than English prompts. Our findings show thatin-context learning can be achieved through cross-lingual transfer throughcarefully crafted prompt templates with examples and instructions.</description><author>Zita Lifelo, Huansheng Ning, Sahraoui Dhelim</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 18:11:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09045v1</guid></item><item><title>The Evolution of Statistical Induction Heads: In-Context Learning Markov Chains</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11004v1</link><description>Large language models have the ability to generate text that mimics patternsin their inputs. We introduce a simple Markov Chain sequence modeling task inorder to study how this in-context learning (ICL) capability emerges. In oursetting, each example is sampled from a Markov chain drawn from a priordistribution over Markov chains. Transformers trained on this task form\emph{statistical induction heads} which compute accurate next-tokenprobabilities given the bigram statistics of the context. During the course oftraining, models pass through multiple phases: after an initial stage in whichpredictions are uniform, they learn to sub-optimally predict using in-contextsingle-token statistics (unigrams); then, there is a rapid phase transition tothe correct in-context bigram solution. We conduct an empirical and theoreticalinvestigation of this multi-phase process, showing how successful learningresults from the interaction between the transformer's layers, and uncoveringevidence that the presence of the simpler unigram solution may delay formationof the final bigram solution. We examine how learning is affected by varyingthe prior distribution over Markov chains, and consider the generalization ofour in-context learning of Markov chains (ICL-MC) task to $n$-grams for $n &gt;2$.</description><author>Benjamin L.

As intraditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player gamebetween the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generaterealistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given aninput prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generatorproduces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying thegenerator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on thediscriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to thegenerator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve theadversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significantimprovements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both openand closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks includingsummarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-textgeneration, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks.

A mechanistic study of in-context learning circuits and their formation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07129v1</link><description>In-context learning is a powerful emergent ability in transformer models.Prior work in mechanistic interpretability has identified a circuit elementthat may be critical for in-context learning -- the induction head (IH), whichperforms a match-and-copy operation. During training of large transformers onnatural language data, IHs emerge around the same time as a notable phasechange in the loss. Despite the robust evidence for IHs and this interestingcoincidence with the phase change, relatively little is known about thediversity and emergence dynamics of IHs. Why is there more than one IH, and howare they dependent on each other? Why do IHs appear all of a sudden, and whatare the subcircuits that enable them to emerge? We answer these questions bystudying IH emergence dynamics in a controlled setting by training on syntheticdata. In doing so, we develop and share a novel optogenetics-inspired causalframework for modifying activations throughout training. Using this framework,we delineate the diverse and additive nature of IHs. By clamping subsets ofactivations throughout training, we then identify three underlying subcircuitsthat interact to drive IH formation, yielding the phase change. Furthermore,these subcircuits shed light on data-dependent properties of formation, such asphase change timing, already showing the promise of this more in-depthunderstanding of subcircuits that need to "go right" for an induction head.</description><author>Aaditya K.

However, itsapplication in 3D point cloud tasks remains largely unexplored. In this work,we introduce Point-In-Context (PIC), a novel framework for 3D point cloudunderstanding via in-context learning. We address the technical challenge ofeffectively extending masked point modeling to 3D point clouds by introducing aJoint Sampling module and proposing a vanilla version of PIC calledPoint-In-Context-Generalist (PIC-G). PIC-G is designed as a generalist modelfor various 3D point cloud tasks, with inputs and outputs modeled ascoordinates. In this paradigm, the challenging segmentation task is achieved byassigning label points with XYZ coordinates for each category; the finalprediction is then chosen based on the label point closest to the predictions.To break the limitation by the fixed label-coordinate assignment, which haspoor generalization upon novel classes, we propose two novel trainingstrategies, In-Context Labeling and In-Context Enhancing, forming an extendedversion of PIC named Point-In-Context-Segmenter (PIC-S), targeting improvingdynamic context labeling and model training. By utilizing dynamic in-contextlabels and extra in-context pairs, PIC-S achieves enhanced performance andgeneralization capability in and across part segmentation datasets. PIC is ageneral framework so that other tasks or datasets can be seamlessly introducedinto our PIC through a unified data format. We conduct extensive experiments tovalidate the versatility and adaptability of our proposed methods in handling awide range of tasks and segmenting multi-datasets. Our PIC-S is capable ofgeneralizing unseen datasets and performing novel part segmentation bycustomizing prompts.</description><author>Mengyuan Liu, Zhongbin Fang, Xia Li, Joachim M.

Built on top ofLLMs, vision large language models (VLLMs) have advanced significantly in areassuch as recognition, reasoning, and grounding. However, investigations into\emph{multimodal ICL} have predominantly focused on few-shot visual questionanswering (VQA), and image captioning, which we will show neither exploit thestrengths of ICL, nor test its limitations. The broader capabilities andlimitations of multimodal ICL remain under-explored. In this study, weintroduce a comprehensive benchmark VL-ICL Bench for multimodal in-contextlearning, encompassing a broad spectrum of tasks that involve both images andtext as inputs and outputs, and different types of challenges, from {perceptionto reasoning and long context length}. We evaluate the abilities ofstate-of-the-art VLLMs against this benchmark suite, revealing their diversestrengths and weaknesses, and showing that even the most advanced models, suchas GPT-4, find the tasks challenging.

While existing research narrowlyfocuses on single-domain applications constrained by methodological limitationsand data scarcity, the reality is that sentiment naturally traverses multipledomains. Although large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution forABSA, it is difficult to integrate effectively with established techniques,including graph-based models and linguistics, because modifying their internalarchitecture is not easy. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novelframework, Feature-aware In-context Learning for Multi-domain ABSA (FaiMA). Thecore insight of FaiMA is to utilize in-context learning (ICL) as afeature-aware mechanism that facilitates adaptive learning in multi-domain ABSAtasks. Specifically, we employ a multi-head graph attention network as a textencoder optimized by heuristic rules for linguistic, domain, and sentimentfeatures. Through contrastive learning, we optimize sentence representations byfocusing on these diverse features. Additionally, we construct an efficientindexing mechanism, allowing FaiMA to stably retrieve highly relevant examplesacross multiple dimensions for any given input. To evaluate the efficacy ofFaiMA, we build the first multi-domain ABSA benchmark dataset. Extensiveexperimental results demonstrate that FaiMA achieves significant performanceimprovements in multiple domains compared to baselines, increasing F1 by 2.07%on average.

This poses a growing risk of misuse of LLMs and demandsthe development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. However, existingdetectors lack robustness against attacks: they degrade detection accuracy bysimply paraphrasing LLM-generated texts. Furthermore, a malicious user mightattempt to deliberately evade the detectors based on detection results, butthis has not been assumed in previous studies. In this paper, we proposeOUTFOX, a framework that improves the robustness of LLM-generated-textdetectors by allowing both the detector and the attacker to consider eachother's output. In this framework, the attacker uses the detector's predictionlabels as examples for in-context learning and adversarially generates essaysthat are harder to detect, while the detector uses the adversarially generatedessays as examples for in-context learning to learn to detect essays from astrong attacker. Experiments in the domain of student essays show that theproposed detector improves the detection performance on the attacker-generatedtexts by up to +41.3 points F1-score. Furthermore, the proposed detector showsa state-of-the-art detection performance: up to 96.9 points F1-score, beatingexisting detectors on non-attacked texts. Finally, the proposed attackerdrastically degrades the performance of detectors by up to -57.0 pointsF1-score, massively outperforming the baseline paraphrasing method for evadingdetection.</description><author>Ryuto Koike, Masahiro Kaneko, Naoaki Okazaki</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2024 12:25:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11729v3</guid></item><item><title>GPT-DETOX: An In-Context Learning-Based Paraphraser for Text Detoxification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03052v1</link><description>Harmful and offensive communication or content is detrimental to socialbonding and the mental state of users on social media platforms. Textdetoxification is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP), wherethe goal is removing profanity and toxicity from text while preserving itscontent. Supervised and unsupervised learning are common approaches fordesigning text detoxification solutions. However, these methods necessitatefine-tuning, leading to computational overhead. In this paper, we proposeGPT-DETOX as a framework for prompt-based in-context learning for textdetoxification using GPT-3.5 Turbo. We utilize zero-shot and few-shot promptingtechniques for detoxifying input sentences. To generate few-shot prompts, wepropose two methods: word-matching example selection (WMES) andcontext-matching example selection (CMES). We additionally take into accountensemble in-context learning (EICL) where the ensemble is shaped by baseprompts from zero-shot and all few-shot settings. We use ParaDetox and APPDIAas benchmark detoxification datasets. Our experimental results show that thezero-shot solution achieves promising performance, while our best few-shotsetting outperforms the state-of-the-art models on ParaDetox and showscomparable results on APPDIA. Our EICL solutions obtain the greatestperformance, adding at least 10% improvement, against both datasets.</description><author>Ali Pesaranghader, Nikhil Verma, Manasa Bharadwaj</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 21:35:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03052v1</guid></item><item><title>EchoPrompt: Instructing the Model to Rephrase Queries for Improved In-context Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10687v3</link><description>Language models are achieving impressive performance on various tasks byaggressively adopting inference-time prompting techniques, such as zero-shotand few-shot prompting. In this work, we introduce EchoPrompt, a simple yeteffective approach that prompts the model to rephrase its queries beforeanswering them. EchoPrompt is adapted for both zero-shot and few-shotin-context learning with standard and chain-of-thought prompting. Experimentalresults show that EchoPrompt yields substantial improvements across all thesesettings for four families of causal language models. These improvements areobserved across various numerical reasoning (e.g. GSM8K, SVAMP), readingcomprehension (e.g. DROP), and logical reasoning (e.g. Coin Flipping) tasks. Onaverage, EchoPrompt improves the Zero-shot-CoT performance of code-davinci-002by 5% in numerical tasks and 13% in reading comprehension tasks. We investigatethe factors contributing to EchoPrompt's effectiveness through ablationstudies, which reveal that both the original query and the model-generatedrephrased version are instrumental in its performance gains.

By instructing LLMsusing few-shot demonstrative examples, ICL enables them to perform a wide rangeof tasks without updating millions of parameters. However, the precisecontributions of demonstrations towards improving end-task performance have notbeen thoroughly investigated in recent analytical studies. In this paper, weempirically decompose the overall performance of ICL into three dimensions,label space, format, and discrimination, and we evaluate four general-purposeLLMs across a diverse range of tasks. Counter-intuitively, we find that thedemonstrations have a marginal impact on provoking discriminative knowledge oflanguage models. However, ICL exhibits significant efficacy in regulating thelabel space and format which helps LLMs to respond in desired label words. Wethen demonstrate this ability functions similar to detailed instructions forLLMs to follow. We additionally provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanismof retrieval helping with ICL and find that retrieving the most semanticallysimilar examples notably boosts model's discriminative capability.</description><author>Quanyu Long, Yin Wu, Wenya Wang, Sinno Jialin Pan</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 09:20:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07546v1</guid></item><item><title>NoisyICL: A Little Noise in Model Parameters Calibrates In-context Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05515v2</link><description>In-Context Learning (ICL) is suffering from unsatisfactory performance andunder-calibration due to high prior bias and unfaithful confidence.

However, there is currently no consensus about how thisin-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs works. For example, while Xie et al.(2021) liken ICL to a general-purpose learning algorithm, Min et al. (2022)argue ICL does not even learn label relationships from in-context examples. Inthis paper, we provide novel insights into how ICL leverages label information,revealing both capabilities and limitations. To ensure we obtain acomprehensive picture of ICL behavior, we study probabilistic aspects of ICLpredictions and thoroughly examine the dynamics of ICL as more examples areprovided. Our experiments show that ICL predictions almost always depend onin-context labels and that ICL can learn truly novel tasks in-context. However,we also find that ICL struggles to fully overcome prediction preferencesacquired from pre-training data and, further, that ICL does not consider allin-context information equally.</description><author>Jannik Kossen, Yarin Gal, Tom Rainforth</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 16:00:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12375v4</guid></item><item><title>ICXML: An In-Context Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Extreme Multi-Label Classification</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09649v2</link><description>This paper focuses on the task of Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMC)whose goal is to predict multiple labels for each instance from an extremelylarge label space.

The standard random baseline -- the expected accuracyof guessing labels uniformly at random -- is stable when the evaluation set isused only once or when the dataset is large. We account for the common practiceof validation set reuse and existing small datasets with a stronger randombaseline: the expected maximum accuracy across multiple random classifiers.When choosing the best prompt demonstrations across six quantized languagemodels applied to 16 BIG-bench Lite tasks, more than 20\% of the few-shotresults that exceed the standard baseline do not exceed this stronger randombaseline. When held-out test sets are available, this stronger baseline is alsoa better predictor of held-out performance than the standard baseline, avoidingunnecessary test set evaluations. This maximum random baseline provides aneasily calculated drop-in replacement for the standard baseline.</description><author>Gregory Yauney, David Mimno</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2024 18:30:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13020v1</guid></item><item><title>Contextrast: Contextual Contrastive Learning for Semantic Segmentation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10633v1</link><description>Despite great improvements in semantic segmentation, challenges persistbecause of the lack of local/global contexts and the relationship between them.In this paper, we propose Contextrast, a contrastive learning-based semanticsegmentation method that allows to capture local/global contexts and comprehendtheir relationships.

Meanwhile, BANE sampling selects embeddingfeatures along the boundaries of incorrectly predicted regions to employ themas harder negative samples on our contrastive learning, resolving segmentationissues along the boundary region by exploiting fine-grained details.

Achieving bestperformance with these models often leverages in-context learning, where amodel performs a (possibly new) task given one or more examples. However,recent work has shown that the choice of examples can have a large impact ontask performance and that finding an optimal set of examples is non-trivial.While there are many existing methods for selecting in-context examples, theygenerally score examples independently, ignoring the dependency between themand the order in which they are provided to the model. In this work, we proposeRetrieval for In-Context Learning (RetICL), a learnable method for modeling andoptimally selecting examples sequentially for in-context learning. We frame theproblem of sequential example selection as a Markov decision process and trainan example retriever using reinforcement learning. We evaluate RetICL on mathword problem solving and scientific question answering tasks and show that itconsistently outperforms or matches heuristic and learnable baselines. We alsouse case studies to show that RetICL implicitly learns representations ofproblem solving strategies.</description><author>Alexander Scarlatos, Andrew Lan</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 18:25:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14502v2</guid></item><item><title>Many-Shot In-Context Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11018v1</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) excel at few-shot in-context learning (ICL) --learning from a few examples provided in context at inference, without anyweight updates. Newly expanded context windows allow us to investigate ICL withhundreds or thousands of examples -- the many-shot regime. Going from few-shotto many-shot, we observe significant performance gains across a wide variety ofgenerative and discriminative tasks. While promising, many-shot ICL can bebottlenecked by the available amount of human-generated examples. To mitigatethis limitation, we explore two new settings: Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL.Reinforced ICL uses model-generated chain-of-thought rationales in place ofhuman examples. Unsupervised ICL removes rationales from the prompt altogether,and prompts the model only with domain-specific questions. We find that bothReinforced and Unsupervised ICL can be quite effective in the many-shot regime,particularly on complex reasoning tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that, unlikefew-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding pretrainingbiases and can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs.

However, learning to parseto rare domain-specific languages (DSLs) from just a few demonstrations ischallenging, limiting the performance of even the most capable LLMs. In thiswork, we improve the effectiveness of ICL for semantic parsing by (1) usinggeneral-purpose programming languages such as Python instead of DSLs, and (2)augmenting prompts with a structured domain description that includes, e.g.,the available classes and functions. We show that both these changessignificantly improve accuracy across three popular datasets. Combined, theylead to dramatic improvements (e.g. 7.9% to 66.5% on SMCalFlow compositionalsplit), nearly closing the performance gap between easier i.i.d.\ and hardercompositional splits when used with a strong model, and reducing the need for alarge number of demonstrations.

Consequently, ICEE can solve Bayesian optimization problemsas efficiently as Gaussian process biased methods do, but in significantly lesstime.

Recently, stylizedmeta-learning-like ICL setups have been devised that train transformers onsequences of input-output pairs $(x, f(x))$. The function $f$ comes from afunction class and generalization is checked by evaluating on sequencesgenerated from unseen functions from the same class. One of the maindiscoveries in this line of research has been that for several functionclasses, such as linear regression, transformers successfully generalize to newfunctions in the class. However, the inductive biases of these models resultingin this behavior are not clearly understood. A model with unlimited trainingdata and compute is a Bayesian predictor: it learns the pretrainingdistribution. In this paper we empirically examine how far this Bayesianperspective can help us understand ICL. To this end, we generalize the previousmeta-ICL setup to hierarchical meta-ICL setup which involve unions of multipletask families. We instantiate this setup on a diverse range of linear andnonlinear function families and find that transformers can do ICL in thissetting as well. Where Bayesian inference is tractable, we find evidence thathigh-capacity transformers mimic the Bayesian predictor. The Bayesianperspective provides insights into the inductive bias of ICL and howtransformers perform a particular task when they are trained on multiple tasks.We also find that transformers can learn to generalize to new function classesthat were not seen during pretraining. This involves deviation from theBayesian predictor. We examine these deviations in more depth offering newinsights and hypotheses.</description><author>Madhur Panwar, Kabir Ahuja, Navin Goyal</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2024 06:12:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04891v2</guid></item><item><title>In-context Learning and Gradient Descent Revisited</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07772v4</link><description>In-context learning (ICL) has shown impressive results in few-shot learningtasks, yet its underlying mechanism is still not fully understood.

Previous explanations of the ICL mechanism, such as$n$-gram induction head, cannot fully account for this phenomenon.</description><author>Jiashu Pu, Yajing Wan, Yuru Zhang, Jing Chen, Ling Cheng, Qian Shao, Yongzhu Chang, Tangjie Lv, Rongsheng Zhang</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2024 06:11:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09954v2</guid></item><item><title>Batch-ICL: Effective, Efficient, and Order-Agnostic In-Context Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06469v2</link><description>In this paper, by treating in-context learning (ICL) as a meta-optimizationprocess, we explain why LLMs are sensitive to the order of ICL examples. Thisunderstanding leads us to the development of Batch-ICL, an effective,efficient, and order-agnostic inference algorithm for ICL. Differing from thestandard N-shot learning approach, Batch-ICL employs $N$ separate 1-shotforward computations and aggregates the resulting meta-gradients. Theseaggregated meta-gradients are then applied to the forward computation of azero-shot query to generate the final prediction. This batch processingapproach renders the LLM agnostic to the order of ICL examples. Throughextensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that Batch-ICL consistentlyoutperforms most permutations of ICL examples. In some cases, it even exceedsthe performance of the best order for standard ICL, all while reducing thecomputational resources required. Furthermore, we develop a novel variant ofBatch-ICL featuring multiple "epochs" of meta-optimization.

We address this question using transformations tasks and an NLI taskthat assess sensitivity to syntax - a requirement for robust languageunderstanding. We further investigate whether out-of-distributiongeneralization can be improved via chain-of-thought prompting, where the modelis provided with a sequence of intermediate computation steps that illustratehow the task ought to be performed. In experiments with models from the GPT,PaLM, and Llama 2 families, we find large variance across LMs. The variance isexplained more by the composition of the pre-training corpus and supervisionmethods than by model size; in particular, models pre-trained on codegeneralize better, and benefit more from chain-of-thought prompting.</description><author>Aaron Mueller, Albert Webson, Jackson Petty, Tal Linzen</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 16:38:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07811v2</guid></item><item><title>Empowering Molecule Discovery for Molecule-Caption Translation with Large Language Models: A ChatGPT Perspective</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06615v2</link><description>Molecule discovery plays a crucial role in various scientific fields,advancing the design of tailored materials and drugs. However, most of theexisting methods heavily rely on domain experts, require excessivecomputational cost, or suffer from sub-optimal performance. On the other hand,Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have shown remarkable performancein various cross-modal tasks due to their powerful capabilities in naturallanguage understanding, generalization, and in-context learning (ICL), whichprovides unprecedented opportunities to advance molecule discovery. Despiteseveral previous works trying to apply LLMs in this task, the lack ofdomain-specific corpus and difficulties in training specialized LLMs stillremain challenges. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based framework(MolReGPT) for molecule-caption translation, where an In-Context Few-ShotMolecule Learning paradigm is introduced to empower molecule discovery withLLMs like ChatGPT to perform their in-context learning capability withoutdomain-specific pre-training and fine-tuning. MolReGPT leverages the principleof molecular similarity to retrieve similar molecules and their textdescriptions from a local database to enable LLMs to learn the task knowledgefrom context examples. We evaluate the effectiveness of MolReGPT onmolecule-caption translation, including molecule understanding and text-basedmolecule generation. Experimental results show that compared to fine-tunedmodels, MolReGPT outperforms MolT5-base and is comparable to MolT5-largewithout additional training. To the best of our knowledge, MolReGPT is thefirst work to leverage LLMs via in-context learning in molecule-captiontranslation for advancing molecule discovery.

However, it is unclear where this capability comes fromas there is a stark distribution shift between pre-training text and ICLprompts. In this work, we study what patterns of the pre-training datacontribute to ICL. We find that LMs' ICL ability depends on $\textit{parallelstructures}$ in the pre-training data -- pairs of phrases following similartemplates in the same context window. Specifically, we detect parallelstructures by checking whether training on one phrase improves prediction ofthe other, and conduct ablation experiments to study their effect on ICL. Weshow that removing parallel structures in the pre-training data reduces LMs'ICL accuracy by 51% (vs 2% from random ablation). This drop persists even whenexcluding common patterns such as n-gram repetitions and long-range dependency,showing the diversity and generality of parallel structures. A closer look atthe detected parallel structures indicates that they cover diverse linguistictasks and span long distances in the data.</description><author>Yanda Chen, Chen Zhao, Zhou Yu, Kathleen McKeown, He He</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2024 20:40:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12530v1</guid></item><item><title>Cell-Free Multi-User MIMO Equalization via In-Context Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05538v1</link><description>Large pre-trained sequence models, such as transformers, excel as few-shotlearners capable of in-context learning (ICL).

Nevertheless, applying LLMs as atext recognizer is unacceptably resource-consuming. Moreover, our pilotexperiments on LLMs show that ICL fails in STR, mainly attributed to theinsufficient incorporation of contextual information from diverse samples inthe training stage. To this end, we introduce E$^2$STR, a STR model trainedwith context-rich scene text sequences, where the sequences are generated viaour proposed in-context training strategy.

Nonetheless, the success of ICL largely hinges on thechoice of few-shot demonstration examples, making the selection processincreasingly crucial. Existing methods have delved into optimizing the quantityand semantic similarity of these examples to improve ICL performances. However,our preliminary experiments indicate that the effectiveness of ICL is limitedby the length of the input context.

To address this, we propose a novel method named parallel in-contextlearning (ParaICL) that effectively utilizes all demonstration examples withoutexceeding the manageable input context length.

Traditional approachesleverage heuristic methods based on widely observed connectivity patterns,offering broad applicability and generalizability without the need for modeltraining. Despite their utility, these methods are limited by their reliance onhuman-derived heuristics and lack the adaptability of data-driven approaches.Conversely, parametric link predictors excel in automatically learning theconnectivity patterns from data and achieving state-of-the-art but fail shortto directly transfer across different graphs. Instead, it requires the cost ofextensive training and hyperparameter optimization to adapt to the targetgraph. In this work, we introduce the Universal Link Predictor (UniLP), a novelmodel that combines the generalizability of heuristic approaches with thepattern learning capabilities of parametric models. UniLP is designed toautonomously identify connectivity patterns across diverse graphs, ready forimmediate application to any unseen graph dataset without targeted training. Weaddress the challenge of conflicting connectivity patterns-arising from theunique distributions of different graphs-through the implementation ofIn-context Learning (ICL). This approach allows UniLP to dynamically adjust tovarious target graphs based on contextual demonstrations, thereby avoidingnegative transfer. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate UniLP'seffectiveness in adapting to new, unseen graphs at test time, showcasing itsability to perform comparably or even outperform parametric models that havebeen finetuned for specific datasets. Our findings highlight UniLP's potentialto set a new standard in link prediction, combining the strengths of heuristicand parametric methods in a single, versatile framework.</description><author>Kaiwen Dong, Haitao Mao, Zhichun Guo, Nitesh V.

In this paper, we raise the fundamental question that whetherhuman-generated demonstrations are necessary for ICL. To answer this question,we propose self-contemplation prompting strategy (SEC), a paradigm free fromhuman-crafted demonstrations. The key point of SEC is that, instead of usinghand-crafted examples as demonstrations in ICL, SEC asks LLMs to first createdemonstrations on their own, based on which the final output is generated. SECis a flexible framework and can be adapted to both the vanilla ICL and thechain-of-thought (CoT), but with greater ease: as the manual-generation processof both examples and rationale can be saved. Extensive experiments inarithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, multi-task language understanding,and code generation benchmarks, show that SEC, which does not requirehand-crafted demonstrations, significantly outperforms the zero-shot learningstrategy, and achieves comparable results to ICL with hand-crafteddemonstrations. This demonstrates that, for many tasks, contemporary LLMspossess a sufficient level of competence to exclusively depend on their owncapacity for decision making, removing the need for external training data.Code is available at https://github.com/ruili33/SEC.</description><author>Rui Li, Guoyin Wang, Jiwei Li</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2024 05:49:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14681v4</guid></item><item><title>DEEP-ICL: Definition-Enriched Experts for Language Model In-Context Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04233v1</link><description>It has long been assumed that the sheer number of parameters in largelanguage models (LLMs) drives in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enablingremarkable performance improvements by leveraging task-specific demonstrations.Challenging this hypothesis, we introduce DEEP-ICL, a novel task DefinitionEnriched ExPert Ensembling methodology for ICL.

However, so far limitedattention has been given to transferring (and evaluating) one of the core LLMcapabilities to the emerging VLMs, namely the In-Context Learning (ICL)ability, or in other words to guide VLMs to desired target downstream tasks oroutput structure using in-context image+text demonstrations. In this work, wedive deeper into analyzing the capabilities of some of the state-of-the-artVLMs to follow ICL instructions, discovering them to be somewhat lacking. Wediscover that even models that underwent large-scale mixed modalitypre-training and were implicitly guided to make use of interleaved image andtext information (intended to consume helpful context from multiple images)under-perform when prompted with few-shot (ICL) demonstrations, likely due totheir lack of `direct' ICL instruction tuning.

Weestablish the global convergence of gradient flow under suitable choices ofinitialization. In addition, we prove that an interesting "task allocation"phenomenon emerges during the gradient flow dynamics, where each attention headfocuses on solving a single task of the multi-task model. Specifically, weprove that the gradient flow dynamics can be split into three phases -- awarm-up phase where the loss decreases rather slowly and the attention headsgradually build up their inclination towards individual tasks, an emergencephase where each head selects a single task and the loss rapidly decreases, anda convergence phase where the attention parameters converge to a limit.Furthermore, we prove the optimality of gradient flow in the sense that thelimiting model learned by gradient flow is on par with the best possiblemulti-head softmax attention model up to a constant factor. Our analysis alsodelineates a strict separation in terms of the prediction accuracy of ICLbetween single-head and multi-head attention models. The key technique for ourconvergence analysis is to map the gradient flow dynamics in the parameterspace to a set of ordinary differential equations in the spectral domain, wherethe relative magnitudes of the semi-singular values of the attention weightsdetermines task allocation. To our best knowledge, our work provides the firstconvergence result for the multi-head softmax attention model.</description><author>Siyu Chen, Heejune Sheen, Tianhao Wang, Zhuoran Yang</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 18:43:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19442v1</guid></item><item><title>Let's Learn Step by Step: Enhancing In-Context Learning Ability with Curriculum Learning</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10738v1</link><description>Demonstration ordering, which is an important strategy for in-contextlearning (ICL), can significantly affects the performance of large languagemodels (LLMs).

Recent advancementsin Multi-Modal Large Language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential inenhancing the explainability as a driving agent by producing controlpredictions along with natural language explanations.

To address this limitation, existing workstypically perform transfer learning or design dedicated pretraining-finetuningstages to learn representative features. However, the mismatch between thesource and target domain can make it challenging to learn optimalrepresentation for volumetric data, while the multi-stage training demandshigher compute as well as careful selection of stage-specific design choices.In contrast, we propose a universal training framework called MedContext thatis architecture-agnostic and can be incorporated into any existing trainingframework for 3D medical segmentation.

To address the broader challenge,we start with the simpler setting of contextual reinforcement learning (cRL),assuming observability of the context values that parameterize the variation inthe system's dynamics, such as the mass or dimensions of a robot, withoutmaking further simplifying assumptions about the observability of the Markovianstate. Toward the goal of ZSG to unseen variation in context, we propose thecontextual recurrent state-space model (cRSSM), which introduces changes to theworld model of the Dreamer (v3) (Hafner et al., 2023). This allows the worldmodel to incorporate context for inferring latent Markovian states from theobservations and modeling the latent dynamics. Our experiments show that suchsystematic incorporation of the context improves the ZSG of the policiestrained on the ``dreams'' of the world model. We further find qualitativelythat our approach allows Dreamer to disentangle the latent state from context,allowing it to extrapolate its dreams to the many worlds of unseen contexts.The code for all our experiments is available at\url{https://github.com/sai-prasanna/dreaming_of_many_worlds}.</description><author>Sai Prasanna, Karim Farid, Raghu Rajan, André Biedenkapp</author><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2024 17:29:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10967v1</guid></item><item><title>Towards More Unified In-context Visual Understanding</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02520v2</link><description>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated theemergence of in-context learning (ICL) as a cutting-edge approach in thenatural language processing domain.

However, existing visual ICL framework can notenable producing content across multiple modalities, which limits theirpotential usage scenarios. To address this issue, we present a new ICLframework for visual understanding with multi-modal output enabled.

These AIassistants are known to be robust to minor prompt modifications, mostly due toalignment techniques that use human feedback. In contrast, the underlyingpre-trained LLMs they use as a backbone are known to be brittle in thisrespect. Building high-quality backbone models remains a core challenge, and acommon approach to assessing their quality is to conduct few-shot evaluation.Such evaluation is notorious for being highly sensitive to minor promptmodifications, as well as the choice of specific in-context examples. Priorwork has examined how modifying different elements of the prompt can affectmodel performance. However, these earlier studies tended to concentrate on alimited number of specific prompt attributes and often produced contradictoryresults. Additionally, previous research either focused on models with fewerthan 15 billion parameters or exclusively examined black-box models like GPT-3or PaLM, making replication challenging. In the present study, we decompose theentire prompt into four components: task description, demonstration inputs,labels, and inline instructions provided for each demonstration. We investigatethe effects of structural and semantic corruptions of these elements on modelperformance. We study models ranging from 1.5B to 70B in size, using tendatasets covering classification and generation tasks. We find that repeatingtext within the prompt boosts model performance, and bigger models ($\geq$30B)are more sensitive to the semantics of the prompt. Finally, we observe thatadding task and inline instructions to the demonstrations enhances modelperformance even when the instructions are semantically corrupted.</description><author>Namrata Shivagunde, Vladislav Lialin, Sherin Muckatira, Anna Rumshisky</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 16:50:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02054v1</guid></item></channel></rss>

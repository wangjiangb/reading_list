Yet, prior to this, no such work has attempted tounify 2D and 3D pose representations in the shared feature space. In thispaper, we propose MPM, a unified 2D-3D human pose representation framework viamasked pose modeling. We treat 2D and 3D poses as two different modalities likevision and language and build a single-stream transformer-based architecture.We apply three pretext tasks, which are masked 2D pose modeling, masked 3D posemodeling, and masked 2D pose lifting to pre-train our network and usefull-supervision to perform further fine-tuning. A high masking ratio of 72.5%in total with a spatio-temporal mask sampling strategy leading to betterrelation modeling both in spatial and temporal domains. MPM can handle multipletasks including 3D human pose estimation, 3D pose estimation from occluded 2Dpose, and 3D pose completion in a single framework. We conduct extensiveexperiments and ablation studies on several widely used human pose datasets andachieve state-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.

On the one hand, D3DP generatesmultiple possible 3D pose hypotheses for a single 2D observation. It graduallydiffuses the ground truth 3D poses to a random distribution, and learns adenoiser conditioned on 2D keypoints to recover the uncontaminated 3D poses.The proposed D3DP is compatible with existing 3D pose estimators and supportsusers to balance efficiency and accuracy during inference through twocustomizable parameters. On the other hand, JPMA is proposed to assemblemultiple hypotheses generated by D3DP into a single 3D pose for practical use.It reprojects 3D pose hypotheses to the 2D camera plane, selects the besthypothesis joint-by-joint based on the reprojection errors, and combines theselected joints into the final pose. The proposed JPMA conducts aggregation atthe joint level and makes use of the 2D prior information, both of which havebeen overlooked by previous approaches. Extensive experiments on Human3.6M andMPI-INF-3DHP datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-artdeterministic and probabilistic approaches by 1.5% and 8.9%, respectively.

Tackling the reverse problem (i.e., refining a 3D pose basedon some natural language feedback) could help for assisted 3D characteranimation or robot teaching, for instance. Although a few recent works explorethe connections between natural language and 3D human pose, none focus ondescribing 3D body pose differences. In this paper, we tackle the problem ofcorrecting 3D human poses with natural language. To this end, we introduce thePoseFix dataset, which consists of several thousand paired 3D poses and theircorresponding text feedback, that describe how the source pose needs to bemodified to obtain the target pose. We demonstrate the potential of thisdataset on two tasks: (1) text-based pose editing, that aims at generatingcorrected 3D body poses given a query pose and a text modifier; and (2)correctional text generation, where instructions are generated based on thedifferences between two body poses.</description><author>Ginger Delmas, Philippe Weinzaepfel, Francesc Moreno-Noguer, Gr√©gory Rogez</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 16:36:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08480v1</guid></item><item><title>Animal3D: A Comprehensive Dataset of 3D Animal Pose and Shape</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11737v1</link><description>Accurately estimating the 3D pose and shape is an essential step towardsunderstanding animal behavior, and can potentially benefit many downstreamapplications, such as wildlife conservation. However, research in this area isheld back by the lack of a comprehensive and diverse dataset with high-quality3D pose and shape annotations. In this paper, we propose Animal3D, the firstcomprehensive dataset for mammal animal 3D pose and shape estimation. Animal3Dconsists of 3379 images collected from 40 mammal species, high-qualityannotations of 26 keypoints, and importantly the pose and shape parameters ofthe SMAL model. All annotations were labeled and checked manually in amulti-stage process to ensure highest quality results. Based on the Animal3Ddataset, we benchmark representative shape and pose estimation models at: (1)supervised learning from only the Animal3D data, (2) synthetic to real transferfrom synthetically generated images, and (3) fine-tuning human pose and shapeestimation models. Our experimental results demonstrate that predicting the 3Dshape and pose of animals across species remains a very challenging task,despite significant advances in human pose estimation. Our results furtherdemonstrate that synthetic pre-training is a viable strategy to boost the modelperformance. Overall, Animal3D opens new directions for facilitating futureresearch in animal 3D pose and shape estimation, and is publicly available.</description><author>Jiacong Xu, Yi Zhang, Jiawei Peng, Wufei Ma, Artur Jesslen, Pengliang Ji, Qixin Hu, Jiehua Zhang, Qihao Liu, Jiahao Wang, Wei Ji, Chen Wang, Xiaoding Yuan, Prakhar Kaushik, Guofeng Zhang, Jie Liu, Yushan Xie, Yawen Cui, Alan Yuille, Adam Kortylewski</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 19:57:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11737v1</guid></item><item><title>DiffuPose: Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation via Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02796v3</link><description>Thanks to the development of 2D keypoint detectors, monocular 3D human poseestimation (HPE) via 2D-to-3D uplifting approaches have achieved remarkableimprovements. Still, monocular 3D HPE is a challenging problem due to theinherent depth ambiguities and occlusions. To handle this problem, manyprevious works exploit temporal information to mitigate such difficulties.However, there are many real-world applications where frame sequences are notaccessible. This paper focuses on reconstructing a 3D pose from a single 2Dkeypoint detection. Rather than exploiting temporal information, we alleviatethe depth ambiguity by generating multiple 3D pose candidates which can bemapped to an identical 2D keypoint. We build a novel diffusion-based frameworkto effectively sample diverse 3D poses from an off-the-shelf 2D detector. Byconsidering the correlation between human joints by replacing the conventionaldenoising U-Net with graph convolutional network, our approach accomplishesfurther performance improvements. We evaluate our method on the widely adoptedHuman3.6M and HumanEva-I datasets. Comprehensive experiments are conducted toprove the efficacy of the proposed method, and they confirm that our modeloutperforms state-of-the-art multi-hypothesis 3D HPE methods.</description><author>Jeongjun Choi, Dongseok Shim, H.

We present the \textit{Multi-Hypothesis \textbf{P}ose \textbf{Syn}thesis\textbf{D}omain \textbf{A}daptation} (\textbf{PoSynDA}) framework to overcomethis issue without extensive target domain annotation. Utilizing adiffusion-centric structure, PoSynDA simulates the 3D pose distribution in thetarget domain, filling the data diversity gap. By incorporating amulti-hypothesis network, it creates diverse pose hypotheses and aligns themwith the target domain. Target-specific source augmentation obtains the targetdomain distribution data from the source domain by decoupling the scale andposition parameters. The teacher-student paradigm and low-rank adaptationfurther refine the process. PoSynDA demonstrates competitive performance onbenchmarks, such as Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW, even comparable with thetarget-trained MixSTE model~\cite{zhang2022mixste}.

This makes the results useful for downstream tasks likehuman action recognition or 3D graphics. Yet, no regressor is perfect, andaccuracy can be affected by ambiguous image evidence or by poses and appearancethat are unseen during training. Most current HPS regressors, however, do notreport the confidence of their outputs, meaning that downstream tasks cannotdifferentiate accurate estimates from inaccurate ones. To address this, wedevelop POCO, a novel framework for training HPS regressors to estimate notonly a 3D human body, but also their confidence, in a single feed-forward pass.Specifically, POCO estimates both the 3D body pose and a per-sample variance.The key idea is to introduce a Dual Conditioning Strategy (DCS) for regressinguncertainty that is highly correlated to pose reconstruction quality. The POCOframework can be applied to any HPS regressor and here we evaluate it bymodifying HMR, PARE, and CLIFF. In all cases, training the network to reasonabout uncertainty helps it learn to more accurately estimate 3D pose. Whilethis was not our goal, the improvement is modest but consistent. Our mainmotivation is to provide uncertainty estimates for downstream tasks; wedemonstrate this in two ways: (1) We use the confidence estimates to bootstrapHPS training. Given unlabelled image data, we take the confident estimates of aPOCO-trained regressor as pseudo ground truth. Retraining with thisautomatically-curated data improves accuracy. (2) We exploit uncertainty invideo pose estimation by automatically identifying uncertain frames (e.g. dueto occlusion) and inpainting these from confident frames.

We presenta method that combines Forward Kinematics (FK) with neural networks to ensure afast and valid prediction of 3D pose. Pose is represented as a hierarchicaltree/graph with nodes corresponding to human joints that model their physicallimits. Given a 2D detection of keypoints in the image, we lift the skeleton to3D using neural networks to predict both the joint rotations and bone lengths.These predictions are then combined with skeletal constraints using an FK layerimplemented as a network layer in PyTorch. The result is a fast and accurateapproach to the estimation of 3D skeletal pose. Through quantitative andqualitative evaluation, we demonstrate the method is significantly moreaccurate than MediaPipe in terms of both per joint positional error and visualappearance.

Our annotation modeluses multi-view feature fusion and an iterative refinement scheme, and achievesan average keypoint error of 4.20 mm, which is 85% lower than the error of theoriginal annotations in Assembly101. AssemblyHands provides 3.0M annotatedimages, including 490K egocentric images, making it the largest existingbenchmark dataset for egocentric 3D hand pose estimation. Using this data, wedevelop a strong single-view baseline of 3D hand pose estimation fromegocentric images.

As opposed to recentworks, most of which first adopt holistic or pixel-level dense regression toobtain relative 3D hand pose and then follow with complex second-stageoperations for 3D global root or scale recovery, we propose a novel unified 3Ddense regression scheme to estimate camera-space 3D hand pose via dense 3Dpoint-wise voting in camera frustum. Through direct dense modeling in 3D domaininspired by Pixel-aligned Implicit Functions for 3D detailed reconstruction,our proposed Neural Voting Field (NVF) fully models 3D dense local evidence andhand global geometry, helping to alleviate common 2D-to-3D ambiguities.Specifically, for a 3D query point in camera frustum and its pixel-alignedimage feature, NVF, represented by a Multi-Layer Perceptron, regresses: (i) itssigned distance to the hand surface; (ii) a set of 4D offset vectors (1D votingweight and 3D directional vector to each hand joint). Following a vote-castingscheme, 4D offset vectors from near-surface points are selected to calculatethe 3D hand joint coordinates by a weighted average. Experiments demonstratethat NVF outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on FreiHAND datasetfor camera-space 3D hand pose estimation.

Existing video-based methods generally recover human mesh byestimating the complex pose and shape parameters from coupled image features,whose high complexity and low representation ability often result ininconsistent pose motion and limited shape patterns. To alleviate this issue,we introduce 3D pose as the intermediary and propose a Pose and MeshCo-Evolution network (PMCE) that decouples this task into two parts: 1)video-based 3D human pose estimation and 2) mesh vertices regression from theestimated 3D pose and temporal image feature. Specifically, we propose atwo-stream encoder that estimates mid-frame 3D pose and extracts a temporalimage feature from the input image sequence. In addition, we design aco-evolution decoder that performs pose and mesh interactions with theimage-guided Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) to make pose and mesh fit thehuman body shape. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PMCEoutperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of both per-frameaccuracy and temporal consistency on three benchmark datasets: 3DPW, Human3.6M,and MPI-INF-3DHP.

In addition, the meshes with different numbers of vertices alsoincrease the difficulty of pose transfer. In this work, we propose a Dual-SideFeature Fusion Pose Transfer Network to improve the pose transfer accuracy ofthe lightweight method. Our method takes the pose features as one of the sideinputs to the decoding network and fuses them into the target mesh layer bylayer at multiple scales. Our proposed Feature Fusion Adaptive InstanceNormalization has the characteristic of having two side input channels thatfuse pose features and identity features as denormalization parameters, thusenhancing the pose transfer capability of the network.

Existing pose lifting works mainly focus on improving theperformance of estimated pose, but they usually underperform when testing onthe ground truth pose data. We observe that the performance of the estimatedpose can be easily improved by preparing good quality 2D pose, such asfine-tuning the 2D pose or using advanced 2D pose detectors. As such, weconcentrate on improving the 3D human pose lifting via ground truth data forthe future improvement of more quality estimated pose data. Towards this goal,a simple yet effective model called Global-local Adaptive Graph ConvolutionalNetwork (GLA-GCN) is proposed in this work. Our GLA-GCN globally models thespatiotemporal structure via a graph representation and backtraces local jointfeatures for 3D human pose estimation via individually connected layers. Tovalidate our model design, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmarkdatasets: Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP. Experimental results showthat our GLA-GCN implemented with ground truth 2D poses significantlyoutperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., up to around 3%, 17%, and 14% errorreductions on Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP, respectively).

We observe that the degradation is caused by two factors:1) the large distribution gap over global positions of poses between the sourceand target datasets due to variant camera parameters and settings, and 2) thedeficient diversity of local structures of poses in training. To this end, wecombine \textbf{global adaptation} and \textbf{local generalization} in\textit{PoseDA}, a simple yet effective framework of unsupervised domainadaptation for 3D human pose estimation. Specifically, global adaptation aimsto align global positions of poses from the source domain to the target domainwith a proposed global position alignment (GPA) module. And localgeneralization is designed to enhance the diversity of 2D-3D pose mapping witha local pose augmentation (LPA) module. These modules bring significantperformance improvement without introducing additional learnable parameters. Inaddition, we propose local pose augmentation (LPA) to enhance the diversity of3D poses following an adversarial training scheme consisting of 1) aaugmentation generator that generates the parameters of pre-defined posetransformations and 2) an anchor discriminator to ensure the reality andquality of the augmented data. Our approach can be applicable to almost all2D-3D lifting models. \textit{PoseDA} achieves 61.3 mm of MPJPE on MPI-INF-3DHPunder a cross-dataset evaluation setup, improving upon the previousstate-of-the-art method by 10.2\%.</description><author>Wenhao Chai, Zhongyu Jiang, Jenq-Neng Hwang, Gaoang Wang</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 07:55:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16456v2</guid></item><item><title>Human-M3: A Multi-view Multi-modal Dataset for 3D Human Pose Estimation in Outdoor Scenes</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00628v2</link><description>3D human pose estimation in outdoor environments has garnered increasingattention recently.

Under the status quo, acquiring such annotated 3D handposes is challenging, e.g., due to the difficulty of 3D annotation and thepresence of occlusion. To reveal this problem, we review the pros and cons ofexisting annotation methods classified as manual, synthetic-model-based,hand-sensor-based, and computational approaches. Additionally, we examinemethods for learning 3D hand poses when annotated data are scarce, includingself-supervised pretraining, semi-supervised learning, and domain adaptation.Based on the study of efficient annotation and learning, we further discusslimitations and possible future directions in this field.</description><author>Takehiko Ohkawa, Ryosuke Furuta, Yoichi Sato</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 07:45:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02257v3</guid></item><item><title>Canonical Fields: Self-Supervised Learning of Pose-Canonicalized Neural Fields</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02493v3</link><description>Coordinate-based implicit neural networks, or neural fields, have emerged asuseful representations of shape and appearance in 3D computer vision. Despiteadvances, however, it remains challenging to build neural fields for categoriesof objects without datasets like ShapeNet that provide "canonicalized" objectinstances that are consistently aligned for their 3D position and orientation(pose). We present Canonical Field Network (CaFi-Net), a self-supervised methodto canonicalize the 3D pose of instances from an object category represented asneural fields, specifically neural radiance fields (NeRFs). CaFi-Net directlylearns from continuous and noisy radiance fields using a Siamese networkarchitecture that is designed to extract equivariant field features forcategory-level canonicalization. During inference, our method takes pre-trainedneural radiance fields of novel object instances at arbitrary 3D pose andestimates a canonical field with consistent 3D pose across the entire category.Extensive experiments on a new dataset of 1300 NeRF models across 13 objectcategories show that our method matches or exceeds the performance of 3D pointcloud-based methods.</description><author>Rohith Agaram, Shaurya Dewan, Rahul Sajnani, Adrien Poulenard, Madhava Krishna, Srinath Sridhar</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 12:02:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02493v3</guid></item><item><title>Snipper: A Spatiotemporal Transformer for Simultaneous Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation Tracking and Forecasting on a Video Snippet</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04320v3</link><description>Multi-person pose understanding from RGB videos involves three complex tasks:pose estimation, tracking and motion forecasting. Intuitively, accuratemulti-person pose estimation facilitates robust tracking, and robust trackingbuilds crucial history for correct motion forecasting. Most existing workseither focus on a single task or employ multi-stage approaches to solvingmultiple tasks separately, which tends to make sub-optimal decision at eachstage and also fail to exploit correlations among the three tasks. In thispaper, we propose Snipper, a unified framework to perform multi-person 3D poseestimation, tracking, and motion forecasting simultaneously in a single stage.We propose an efficient yet powerful deformable attention mechanism toaggregate spatiotemporal information from the video snippet. Building upon thisdeformable attention, a video transformer is learned to encode thespatiotemporal features from the multi-frame snippet and to decode informativepose features for multi-person pose queries. Finally, these pose queries areregressed to predict multi-person pose trajectories and future motions in asingle shot. In the experiments, we show the effectiveness of Snipper on threechallenging public datasets where our generic model rivals specializedstate-of-art baselines for pose estimation, tracking, and forecasting.</description><author>Shihao Zou, Yuanlu Xu, Chao Li, Lingni Ma, Li Cheng, Minh Vo</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 22:21:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04320v3</guid></item><item><title>Weakly Supervised Multi-Modal 3D Human Body Pose Estimation for Autonomous Driving</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14889v1</link><description>Accurate 3D human pose estimation (3D HPE) is crucial for enabling autonomousvehicles (AVs) to make informed decisions and respond proactively in criticalroad scenarios. Promising results of 3D HPE have been gained in several domainssuch as human-computer interaction, robotics, sports and medical analytics,often based on data collected in well-controlled laboratory environments.Nevertheless, the transfer of 3D HPE methods to AVs has received limitedresearch attention, due to the challenges posed by obtaining accurate 3D poseannotations and the limited suitability of data from other domains. We present a simple yet efficient weakly supervised approach for 3D HPE inthe AV context by employing a high-level sensor fusion between camera and LiDARdata. The weakly supervised setting enables training on the target datasetswithout any 2D/3D keypoint labels by using an off-the-shelf 2D joint extractorand pseudo labels generated from LiDAR to image projections. Our approachoutperforms state-of-the-art results by up to $\sim$ 13% on the Waymo OpenDataset in the weakly supervised setting and achieves state-of-the-art resultsin the supervised setting.</description><author>Peter Bauer, Arij Bouazizi, Ulrich Kressel, Fabian B.

Our main contributions lie in twodimensions: learning the part-wise motion context and employing the poseensemble to utilize 2D and 3D pose jointly. First, our empirical observationimplies that part-wise context encoding benefits the performance of signlanguage recognition. While previous methods of sign language recognitionlearned motion context from the sequence of the entire pose, we argue that suchmethods cannot exploit part-specific motion context. In order to utilizepart-wise motion context, we propose the alternating combination of a part-wiseencoding Transformer (PET) and a whole-body encoding Transformer (WET). PETencodes the motion contexts from a part sequence, while WET merges them into aunified context. By learning part-wise motion context, our P3D achievessuperior performance on WLASL compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.Second, our framework is the first to ensemble 2D and 3D poses for signlanguage recognition.

This task carries great importance forfields like AIGC and human-robot interaction. In practice, 3D human poseestimation in real-world settings is a critical initial step in solving thisproblem. However, the current datasets, often collected under controlledlaboratory conditions using complex motion capture equipment and unvaryingbackgrounds, are insufficient. The absence of real-world datasets is stallingthe progress of this crucial task. To facilitate the development of 3D poseestimation, we present FreeMan, the first large-scale, real-world multi-viewdataset. FreeMan was captured by synchronizing 8 smartphones across diversescenarios. It comprises 11M frames from 8000 sequences, viewed from differentperspectives. These sequences cover 40 subjects across 10 different scenarios,each with varying lighting conditions. We have also established an automated,precise labeling pipeline that allows for large-scale processing efficiently.We provide comprehensive evaluation baselines for a range of tasks, underliningthe significant challenges posed by FreeMan. Further evaluations of standardindoor/outdoor human sensing datasets reveal that FreeMan offers robustrepresentation transferability in real and complex scenes.

To overcome this gap in the literature, we present 3D-MuPPET, aframework to estimate and track 3D poses of up to 10 pigeons at interactivespeed using multiple-views. We train a pose estimator to infer 2D keypoints andbounding boxes of multiple pigeons, then triangulate the keypoints to 3D. Forcorrespondence matching, we first dynamically match 2D detections to globalidentities in the first frame, then use a 2D tracker to maintaincorrespondences accross views in subsequent frames. We achieve comparableaccuracy to a state of the art 3D pose estimator for Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) and Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK). We also showcase a novel usecase where our model trained with data of single pigeons provides comparableresults on data containing multiple pigeons. This can simplify the domain shiftto new species because annotating single animal data is less labour intensivethan multi-animal data. Additionally, we benchmark the inference speed of3D-MuPPET, with up to 10 fps in 2D and 1.5 fps in 3D, and perform quantitativetracking evaluation, which yields encouraging results. Finally, we show that3D-MuPPET also works in natural environments without model fine-tuning onadditional annotations.

Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has been proven inherently suitable tomodel the human skeletal topology. However, current GCN-based 3D HPE methodsupdate the node features by aggregating their neighbors' information withoutconsidering the interaction of joints in different motion patterns. Althoughsome studies import limb information to learn the movement patterns, the latentsynergies among joints, such as maintaining balance in the motion are seldominvestigated. We propose a hop-wise GraphFormer with intragroup jointrefinement (HopFIR) to tackle the 3D HPE problem. The HopFIR mainly consists ofa novel Hop-wise GraphFormer(HGF) module and an Intragroup JointRefinement(IJR) module which leverages the prior limb information forperipheral joints refinement. The HGF module groups the joints by $k$-hopneighbors and utilizes a hop-wise transformer-like attention mechanism amongthese groups to discover latent joint synergy. Extensive experimental resultsshow that HopFIR outperforms the SOTA methods with a large margin (on theHuman3.6M dataset, the mean per joint position error (MPJPE) is 32.67mm).Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that previous SOTA GCN-based methods canbenefit from the proposed hop-wise attention mechanism efficiently withsignificant performance promotion, such as SemGCN and MGCN are improved by 8.9%and 4.5%, respectively.</description><author>Kai Zhai, Qiang Nie, Bo Ouyang, Xiang Li, ShanLin Yang</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2023 17:07:55 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14581v2</guid></item><item><title>Denoising Diffusion for 3D Hand Pose Estimation from Images</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09523v1</link><description>Hand pose estimation from a single image has many applications.

As such, detailed hand-to-hand interactions are poorlyrepresented, especially during motion. We see this in the failure cases oftechniques such as OpenPose or MediaPipe. However, accurate hand poseestimation is crucial for many applications where the global body motion isless important than accurate hand pose estimation. This paper addresses the problem of 3D hand pose estimation from monocularimages or sequences. We present a novel end-to-end framework for 3D handregression that employs diffusion models that have shown excellent ability tocapture the distribution of data for generative purposes. Moreover, we enforcekinematic constraints to ensure realistic poses are generated by incorporatingan explicit forward kinematic layer as part of the network.

Existing pose lifting works mainly focus on improving theperformance of estimated pose, but they usually underperform when testing onthe ground truth pose data. We observe that the performance of the estimatedpose can be easily improved by preparing good quality 2D pose, such asfine-tuning the 2D pose or using advanced 2D pose detectors. As such, weconcentrate on improving the 3D human pose lifting via ground truth data forthe future improvement of more quality estimated pose data. Towards this goal,a simple yet effective model called Global-local Adaptive Graph ConvolutionalNetwork (GLA-GCN) is proposed in this work. Our GLA-GCN globally models thespatiotemporal structure via a graph representation and backtraces local jointfeatures for 3D human pose estimation via individually connected layers. Tovalidate our model design, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmarkdatasets: Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP. Experimental results showthat our GLA-GCN implemented with ground truth 2D poses significantlyoutperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., up to around 3%, 17%, and 13% errorreductions on Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP, respectively).</description><author>Bruce X.

Despite their success, most of thesemethods only consider spatial correlations between body joints and do not takeinto account temporal correlations, thereby limiting their ability to capturerelationships in the presence of occlusions and inherent ambiguity. To addressthis potential weakness, we propose a spatio-temporal network architecturecomposed of a joint-mixing multi-layer perceptron block that facilitatescommunication among different joints and a graph weighted Jacobi network blockthat enables communication among various feature channels. The major novelty ofour approach lies in a new weighted Jacobi feature propagation rule obtainedthrough graph filtering with implicit fairing. We leverage temporal informationfrom the 2D pose sequences, and integrate weight modulation into the model toenable untangling of the feature transformations of distinct nodes. We alsoemploy adjacency modulation with the aim of learning meaningful correlationsbeyond defined linkages between body joints by altering the graph topologythrough a learnable modulation matrix.

Currently, the lack of a fully annotated andaccurate 3D whole-body dataset results in deep networks being trainedseparately on specific body parts, which are combined during inference. Or theyrely on pseudo-groundtruth provided by parametric body models which are not asaccurate as detection based methods. To overcome these issues, we introduce theHuman3.6M 3D WholeBody (H3WB) dataset, which provides whole-body annotationsfor the Human3.6M dataset using the COCO Wholebody layout. H3WB comprises 133whole-body keypoint annotations on 100K images, made possible by our newmulti-view pipeline. We also propose three tasks: i) 3D whole-body pose liftingfrom 2D complete whole-body pose, ii) 3D whole-body pose lifting from 2Dincomplete whole-body pose, and iii) 3D whole-body pose estimation from asingle RGB image. Additionally, we report several baselines from popularmethods for these tasks.

Our approach follows a unique two-step process, whichinvolves first lifting the occluded 2D pose to the 3D domain, followed byfilling in the occluded parts using the partially reconstructed 3D coordinates.This lift-then-fill approach leads to significantly more accurate resultscompared to models that complete the pose in 2D space alone. Additionally, weimprove the stability and likelihood estimation of normalising flows through acustom sampling function replacing PCA dimensionality reduction previously usedin prior work. Furthermore, we are the first to investigate if different partsof the 2D kinematic skeleton can be lifted independently which we find byitself reduces the error of current lifting approaches. We attribute this tothe reduction of long-range keypoint correlations. In our detailed evaluation,we quantify the error under various realistic occlusion scenarios, showcasingthe versatility and applicability of our model. Our results consistentlydemonstrate the superiority of handling all types of occlusions in 3D spacewhen compared to others that complete the pose in 2D space. Our approach alsoexhibits consistent accuracy in scenarios without occlusion, as evidenced by a7.9% reduction in reconstruction error compared to prior works on the Human3.6Mdataset. Furthermore, our method excels in accurately retrieving complete 3Dposes even in the presence of occlusions, making it highly applicable insituations where complete 2D pose information is unavailable.</description><author>Peter Hardy, Hansung Kim</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2023 19:28:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07243v1</guid></item><item><title>Regular Splitting Graph Network for 3D Human Pose Estimation</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05785v1</link><description>In human pose estimation methods based on graph convolutional architectures,the human skeleton is usually modeled as an undirected graph whose nodes arebody joints and edges are connections between neighboring joints. However, mostof these methods tend to focus on learning relationships between body joints ofthe skeleton using first-order neighbors, ignoring higher-order neighbors andhence limiting their ability to exploit relationships between distant joints.In this paper, we introduce a higher-order regular splitting graph network(RS-Net) for 2D-to-3D human pose estimation using matrix splitting inconjunction with weight and adjacency modulation. The core idea is to capturelong-range dependencies between body joints using multi-hop neighborhoods andalso to learn different modulation vectors for different body joints as well asa modulation matrix added to the adjacency matrix associated to the skeleton.This learnable modulation matrix helps adjust the graph structure by addingextra graph edges in an effort to learn additional connections between bodyjoints. Instead of using a shared weight matrix for all neighboring bodyjoints, the proposed RS-Net model applies weight unsharing before aggregatingthe feature vectors associated to the joints in order to capture the differentrelations between them.

Existing methods primarily focus on pair-wise interaction ofbody joints, which is insufficient for scenarios involving overlapping jointsand rapidly changing poses. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novelapproach, the High-order Directed Transformer (HDFormer), which leverageshigh-order bone and joint relationships for improved pose estimation.Specifically, HDFormer incorporates both self-attention and high-orderattention to formulate a multi-order attention module. This module facilitatesfirst-order "joint$\leftrightarrow$joint", second-order"bone$\leftrightarrow$joint", and high-order "hyperbone$\leftrightarrow$joint"interactions, effectively addressing issues in complex and occlusion-heavysituations. In addition, modern CNN techniques are integrated into thetransformer-based architecture, balancing the trade-off between performance andefficiency. HDFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) modelson Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, requiring only 1/10 of the parametersand significantly lower computational costs.

Two reasons account for this issue: First,existing facial recognition methods struggle with extracting facial datacaptured from large camera angles or back views. Second, it is challenging tolearn a distribution of 3D portraits covering the one-quarter headshot regionfrom single-view data due to significant geometric deformation caused bydiverse body poses. To this end, we first create the dataset360{\deg}-Portrait-HQ (360{\deg}PHQ for short) which consists of high-qualitysingle-view real portraits annotated with a variety of camera parameters (theyaw angles span the entire 360{\deg} range) and body poses. We then propose3DPortraitGAN, the first 3D-aware one-quarter headshot portrait generator thatlearns a canonical 3D avatar distribution from the 360{\deg}PHQ dataset withbody pose self-learning.

Our first contribution is to develop PACE3D* and PACE2D*, thefirst certifiably optimal solvers for pose and shape estimation using 3D and 2Dkeypoints, respectively. Both solvers rely on the design of tight (i.e., exact)semidefinite relaxations. Our second contribution is to develop outlier-robustversions of both solvers, named PACE3D# and PACE2D#. Towards this goal, wepropose ROBIN, a general graph-theoretic framework to prune outliers, whichuses compatibility hypergraphs to model measurements' compatibility. We showthat in category-level perception problems these hypergraphs can be built fromthe winding orders of the keypoints (in 2D) or their convex hulls (in 3D), andmany outliers can be filtered out via maximum hyperclique computation. The lastcontribution is an extensive experimental evaluation. Besides providing anablation study on simulated datasets and on the PASCAL3D+ dataset, we combineour solver with a deep keypoint detector, and show that PACE3D# improves overthe state of the art in vehicle pose estimation in the ApolloScape datasets,and its runtime is compatible with practical applications.

Inspiredby biomechanics, we infer the pressure heatmap on the body, the Center ofPressure (CoP) from the heatmap, and the SMPL body's Center of Mass (CoM). Withthese, we develop IPMAN, to estimate a 3D body from a color image in a "stable"configuration by encouraging plausible floor contact and overlapping CoP andCoM. Our IP terms are intuitive, easy to implement, fast to compute,differentiable, and can be integrated into existing optimization and regressionmethods. We evaluate IPMAN on standard datasets and MoYo, a new dataset withsynchronized multi-view images, ground-truth 3D bodies with complex poses,body-floor contact, CoM and pressure. IPMAN produces more plausible resultsthan the state of the art, improving accuracy for static poses, while nothurting dynamic ones.

This ADT release contains 200 sequences of real-world activitiesconducted by Aria wearers in two real indoor scenes with 398 object instances(324 stationary and 74 dynamic). Each sequence consists of: a) raw data of twomonochrome camera streams, one RGB camera stream, two IMU streams; b) completesensor calibration; c) ground truth data including continuous6-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) poses of the Aria devices, object 6DoF poses, 3D eyegaze vectors, 3D human poses, 2D image segmentations, image depth maps; and d)photo-realistic synthetic renderings. To the best of our knowledge, there is noexisting egocentric dataset with a level of accuracy, photo-realism andcomprehensiveness comparable to ADT.

Recently, synthetic data has been widely used for poseestimation tasks, but most methods still rely on supervised learning paradigmsutilising synthetic images and labels. Can training be fully unsupervised? Is atiny synthetic dataset sufficient? What are the minimum assumptions that wecould make for estimating animal pose? Our proposal addresses these questionsthrough a simple yet effective self-supervised method that only assumes theavailability of unlabelled images and a small set of synthetic 2D poses. Wecompletely remove the need for any 3D or 2D pose annotations (or complex 3Danimal models), and surprisingly our approach can still learn accurate 3D and2D poses simultaneously. We train our method with unlabelled images of horsesmainly collected for YouTube videos and a prior consisting of 2D syntheticposes. The latter is three times smaller than the number of images needed fortraining. We test our method on a challenging set of horse images and evaluatethe predicted 3D and 2D poses. We demonstrate that it is possible to learnaccurate animal poses even with as few assumptions as unlabelled images and asmall set of 2D poses generated from synthetic data. Given the minimumrequirements and the abundance of unlabelled data, our method could be easilydeployed to different animals.</description><author>Jose Sosa, David Hogg</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2023 10:02:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03411v1</guid></item><item><title>An Efficient Convex Hull-based Vehicle Pose Estimation Method for 3D LiDAR</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01034v2</link><description>Vehicle pose estimation with LiDAR is essential in the perception technologyof autonomous driving. However, due to incomplete observation measurements andsparsity of the LiDAR point cloud, it is challenging to achieve satisfactorypose extraction based on 3D LiDAR by using the existing pose estimationmethods. In addition, the requirement for real-time performance furtherincreases the difficulty of the pose estimation task. In this paper, weproposed a novel convex hull-based vehicle pose estimation method. Theextracted 3D cluster is reduced to the convex hull, reducing the computationburden and retaining contour information. Then a novel criterion based on theminimum occlusion area is developed for the search-based algorithm, which canachieve accurate pose estimation. This criterion also makes the proposedalgorithm especially suitable for obstacle avoidance. The proposed algorithm isvalidated on the KITTI dataset and a manually labeled dataset acquired at anindustrial park. The results show that our proposed method can achieve betteraccuracy than the state-of-the-art pose estimation method while maintainingreal-time speed.</description><author>Ningning Ding</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2023 00:47:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01034v2</guid></item><item><title>PointHPS: Cascaded 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation from Point Clouds</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14492v1</link><description>Human pose and shape estimation (HPS) has attracted increasing attention inrecent years. While most existing studies focus on HPS from 2D images or videoswith inherent depth ambiguity, there are surging need to investigate HPS from3D point clouds as depth sensors have been frequently employed in commercialdevices. However, real-world sensory 3D points are usually noisy andincomplete, and also human bodies could have different poses of high diversity.To tackle these challenges, we propose a principled framework, PointHPS, foraccurate 3D HPS from point clouds captured in real-world settings, whichiteratively refines point features through a cascaded architecture.Specifically, each stage of PointHPS performs a series of downsampling andupsampling operations to extract and collate both local and global cues, whichare further enhanced by two novel modules: 1) Cross-stage Feature Fusion (CFF)for multi-scale feature propagation that allows information to flow effectivelythrough the stages, and 2) Intermediate Feature Enhancement (IFE) forbody-aware feature aggregation that improves feature quality after each stage.To facilitate a comprehensive study under various scenarios, we conduct ourexperiments on two large-scale benchmarks, comprising i) a dataset thatfeatures diverse subjects and actions captured by real commercial sensors in alaboratory environment, and ii) controlled synthetic data generated withrealistic considerations such as clothed humans in crowded outdoor scenes.Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointHPS, with its powerful pointfeature extraction and processing scheme, outperforms State-of-the-Art methodsby significant margins across the board.

Although the use of 2D keypoints joined by"stick-figure" limbs has shown promise as an intermediate step, stick-figuresdo not account for occlusion information that is often inherent in an image. Inthis paper, we propose a novel representation using opaque 3D limbs thatpreserves occlusion information while implicitly encoding joint locations.Crucially, when training on data with accurate three-dimensional keypoints andwithout part-maps, this representation allows training on abstract syntheticimages, with occlusion, from as many synthetic viewpoints as desired. Theresult is a pose defined by limb angles rather than joint positions$\unicode{x2013}$ because poses are, in the real world, independent of cameras$\unicode{x2013}$ allowing us to predict poses that are completely independentof camera viewpoint.

To represent the 2D object, ellipse labels haverecently been identified as a promising alternative to axis-aligned boundingboxes. This paper further considers 3D-aware ellipse labels, \textit{i.e.},ellipses which are projections of a 3D ellipsoidal approximation of the object,for 2D target localization. Indeed, projected ellipses carry more geometricinformation about the object geometry and pose (3D awareness) than traditional3D-agnostic bounding box labels. Moreover, such a generic 3D ellipsoidal modelallows for approximating known to coarsely known targets. We then propose tohave a new look at ellipse regression and replace the discontinuous geometricellipse parameters with the parameters of an implicit Gaussian distributionencoding object occupancy in the image. The models are trained to regress thevalues of this bivariate Gaussian distribution over the image pixels using astatistical loss function. We introduce a novel non-trainable differentiablelayer, E-DSNT, to extract the distribution parameters. Also, we describe how toreadily generate consistent 3D-aware Gaussian occupancy parameters using onlycoarse dimensions of the target and relative pose labels. We extend threeexisting spacecraft pose estimation datasets with 3D-aware Gaussian occupancylabels to validate our hypothesis.

The problem should beaddressed by a framework that takes multiple unconstrained images as inputs,and generates a shape-with-skinning avatar in the canonical space, finished inone feed-forward pass. To this end, we present 3D Avatar Reconstruction in thewild (ARwild), which first reconstructs the implicit skinning fields in amulti-level manner, by which the image features from multiple images arealigned and integrated to estimate a pixel-aligned implicit function thatrepresents the clothed shape. To enable the training and testing of the newframework, we contribute a large-scale dataset, MVP-Human (Multi-View andmulti-Pose 3D Human), which contains 400 subjects, each of which has 15 scansin different poses and 8-view images for each pose, providing 6,000 3D scansand 48,000 images in total.

Existing approachescan be categorized into geometry-based and learning-based methods. The formerleverages multi-view geometry but can face catastrophic failures due to thereliance on accurate pixel correspondence across views. The latter wasproffered to mitigate these issues by learning 2D or 3D representationdirectly. However, without a large-scale video or 3D training data, it canhardly generalize to diverse real-world scenarios due to the presence of tensof millions or even billions of optimization parameters in the deep network.Recently, robust monocular depth estimation models trained with large-scaledatasets have been proven to possess weak 3D geometry prior, but they areinsufficient for reconstruction due to the unknown camera parameters, theaffine-invariant property, and inter-frame inconsistency. Here, we propose anovel test-time optimization approach that can transfer the robustness ofaffine-invariant depth models such as LeReS to challenging diverse scenes whileensuring inter-frame consistency, with only dozens of parameters to optimizeper video frame. Specifically, our approach involves freezing the pre-trainedaffine-invariant depth model's depth predictions, rectifying them by optimizingthe unknown scale-shift values with a geometric consistency alignment module,and employing the resulting scale-consistent depth maps to robustly obtaincamera poses and achieve dense scene reconstruction, even in low-textureregions.

Our first contribution is a general theory of certification forend-to-end perception models. In particular, we introduce the notion of$\zeta$-correctness, which bounds the distance between an estimate and theground truth. We show that $\zeta$-correctness can be assessed by implementingtwo certificates: (i) a certificate of observable correctness, that asserts ifthe model output is consistent with the input data and prior information, (ii)a certificate of non-degeneracy, that asserts whether the input data issufficient to compute a unique estimate. Our second contribution is to applythis theory and design a new learning-based certifiable pose estimator. Wepropose C-3PO, a semantic-keypoint-based pose estimation model, augmented withthe two certificates, to solve the certifiable pose estimation problem. C-3POalso includes a keypoint corrector, implemented as a differentiableoptimization layer, that can correct large detection errors (e.g. due to thesim-to-real gap). Our third contribution is a novel self-supervised trainingapproach that uses our certificate of observable correctness to provide thesupervisory signal to C-3PO during training. In it, the model trains only onthe observably correct input-output pairs, in each training iteration. Astraining progresses, we see that the observably correct input-output pairsgrow, eventually reaching near 100% in many cases. Our experiments show that(i) standard semantic-keypoint-based methods outperform more recentalternatives, (ii) C-3PO further improves performance and significantlyoutperforms all the baselines, and (iii) C-3PO's certificates are able todiscern correct pose estimates.</description><author>Rajat Talak, Lisa Peng, Luca Carlone</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 20:47:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11215v4</guid></item><item><title>Few-View Object Reconstruction with Unknown Categories and Camera Poses</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04492v2</link><description>While object reconstruction has made great strides in recent years, currentmethods typically require densely captured images and/or known camera poses,and generalize poorly to novel object categories. To step toward objectreconstruction in the wild, this work explores reconstructing generalreal-world objects from a few images without known camera poses or objectcategories. The crux of our work is solving two fundamental 3D vision problems-- shape reconstruction and pose estimation -- in a unified approach. Ourapproach captures the synergies of these two problems: reliable camera poseestimation gives rise to accurate shape reconstruction, and the accuratereconstruction, in turn, induces robust correspondence between different viewsand facilitates pose estimation. Our method FORGE predicts 3D features fromeach view and leverages them in conjunction with the input images to establishcross-view correspondence for estimating relative camera poses. The 3D featuresare then transformed by the estimated poses into a shared space and are fusedinto a neural radiance field. The reconstruction results are rendered by volumerendering techniques, enabling us to train the model without 3D shapeground-truth. Our experiments show that FORGE reliably reconstructs objectsfrom five views. Our pose estimation method outperforms existing ones by alarge margin. The reconstruction results under predicted poses are comparableto the ones using ground-truth poses. The performance on novel testingcategories matches the results on categories seen during training.

For such applications, pose estimation for hand and surgicalinstruments from an egocentric perspective is a fundamental task and has beenstudied extensively in the computer vision field in recent years. However, thedevelopment of this field has been impeded by a lack of datasets, especially inthe surgical field, where bloody gloves and reflective metallic tools make ithard to obtain 3D pose annotations for hands and objects using conventionalmethods. To address this issue, we propose POV-Surgery, a large-scale,synthetic, egocentric dataset focusing on pose estimation for hands withdifferent surgical gloves and three orthopedic surgical instruments, namelyscalpel, friem, and diskplacer.

A critical prerequisite for realizing this collaborative paradigm isprecisely understanding the robot's 3D pose within its environment. Therefore,in this paper, we introduce a novel vision-based system leveraging depth datato accurately establish the 3D locations of robotic joints. Specifically, weprove the ability of the proposed system to enhance its current pose estimationaccuracy by jointly learning to forecast future poses. Indeed, we introduce theconcept of Pose Nowcasting, denoting the capability of a system to exploit thelearned knowledge of the future to improve the estimation of the present. Theexperimental evaluation is conducted on two different datasets, providingstate-of-the-art and real-time performance and confirming the validity of theproposed method on both the robotic and human scenarios.</description><author>Alessandro Simoni, Francesco Marchetti, Guido Borghi, Federico Becattini, Lorenzo Seidenari, Roberto Vezzani, Alberto Del Bimbo</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 17:40:47 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12914v1</guid></item><item><title>Real-time Simultaneous Multi-Object 3D Shape Reconstruction, 6DoF Pose Estimation and Dense Grasp Prediction</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09510v1</link><description>Robotic manipulation systems operating in complex environments rely onperception systems that provide information about the geometry (pose and 3Dshape) of the objects in the scene along with other semantic information suchas object labels. This information is then used for choosing the feasiblegrasps on relevant objects. In this paper, we present a novel method to providethis geometric and semantic information of all objects in the scene as well asfeasible grasps on those objects simultaneously. The main advantage of ourmethod is its speed as it avoids sequential perception and grasp planningsteps. With detailed quantitative analysis, we show that our method deliverscompetitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art dedicated methods forobject shape, pose, and grasp predictions while providing fast inference at 30frames per second speed.</description><author>Shubham Agrawal, Nikhil Chavan-Dafle, Isaac Kasahara, Selim Engin, Jinwook Huh, Volkan Isler</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 16:03:20 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09510v1</guid></item><item><title>EgoHumans: An Egocentric 3D Multi-Human Benchmark</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16487v1</link><description>We present EgoHumans, a new multi-view multi-human video benchmark to advancethe state-of-the-art of egocentric human 3D pose estimation and tracking.Existing egocentric benchmarks either capture single subject or indoor-onlyscenarios, which limit the generalization of computer vision algorithms forreal-world applications.

An ideal neural network architecturefor such tasks would leverage the fact that objects can be rotated andtranslated in three dimensions to make predictions about novel images. However,imposing SO(3)-equivariance on two-dimensional inputs is difficult because thegroup of three-dimensional rotations does not have a natural action on thetwo-dimensional plane. Specifically, it is possible that an element of SO(3)will rotate an image out of plane. We show that an algorithm that learns athree-dimensional representation of the world from two dimensional images mustsatisfy certain geometric consistency properties which we formulate asSO(2)-equivariance constraints. We use the induced and restrictedrepresentations of SO(2) on SO(3) to construct and classify architectures whichsatisfy these geometric consistency constraints. We prove that any architecturewhich respects said consistency constraints can be realized as an instance ofour construction. We show that three previously proposed neural architecturesfor 3D pose prediction are special cases of our construction. We propose a newalgorithm that is a learnable generalization of previously considered methods.We test our architecture on three pose predictions task and achieve SOTAresults on both the PASCAL3D+ and SYMSOL pose estimation tasks.</description><author>Owen Howell, David Klee, Ondrej Biza, Linfeng Zhao, Robin Walters</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 17:30:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03704v1</guid></item><item><title>Object pop-up: Can we infer 3D objects and their poses from human interactions alone?</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00777v1</link><description>The intimate entanglement between objects affordances and human poses is oflarge interest, among others, for behavioural sciences, cognitive psychology,and Computer Vision communities.

However, the inverse perspective issignificantly less explored: Can we infer 3D objects and their poses from humaninteractions alone? Our investigation follows this direction, showing that ageneric 3D human point cloud is enough to pop up an unobserved object, evenwhen the user is just imitating a functionality (e.g., looking through abinocular) without involving a tangible counterpart.

One specific instance of thischallenge is the acquisition of fingerspelling sign language in robots. In thispaper, we propose an approach for learning dexterous motor imitation from videoexamples without additional information. To achieve this, we first build a URDFmodel of a robotic hand with a single actuator for each joint. We then leveragepre-trained deep vision models to extract the 3D pose of the hand from RGBvideos. Next, using state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms formotion imitation (namely, proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic),we train a policy to reproduce the movement extracted from the demonstrations.We identify the optimal set of hyperparameters for imitation based on areference motion. Finally, we demonstrate the generalizability of our approachby testing it on six different tasks, corresponding to fingerspelled letters.Our results show that our approach is able to successfully imitate thesefine-grained movements without additional information, highlighting itspotential for real-world applications in robotics.</description><author>Federico Tavella, Aphrodite Galata, Angelo Cangelosi</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2023 13:56:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05135v3</guid></item><item><title>Listen, Denoise, Action!

We show that these models arean excellent fit for synthesising human motion that co-occurs with audio, e.g.,dancing and co-speech gesticulation, since motion is complex and highlyambiguous given audio, calling for a probabilistic description. Specifically,we adapt the DiffWave architecture to model 3D pose sequences, puttingConformers in place of dilated convolutions for improved modelling power. Wealso demonstrate control over motion style, using classifier-free guidance toadjust the strength of the stylistic expression. Experiments on gesture anddance generation confirm that the proposed method achieves top-of-the-linemotion quality, with distinctive styles whose expression can be made more orless pronounced. We also synthesise path-driven locomotion using the same modelarchitecture. Finally, we generalise the guidance procedure to obtainproduct-of-expert ensembles of diffusion models and demonstrate how these maybe used for, e.g., style interpolation, a contribution we believe is ofindependent interest.

Mostof the existing methods extract features from color images to estimate theroot-aligned hand meshes, which neglect the crucial depth and scale informationin the real world. Given the noisy sensor measurements with limited resolution,depth-based methods predict 3D keypoints rather than a dense mesh. Theselimitations motivate us to take advantage of these two complementary inputs toacquire dense hand meshes on a real-world scale. In this work, we propose anend-to-end framework for recovering dense meshes for both hands, which employsingle-view RGB-D image pairs as input. The primary challenge lies ineffectively utilizing two different input modalities to mitigate the blurringeffects in RGB images and noises in depth images. Instead of directly treatingdepth maps as additional channels for RGB images, we encode the depthinformation into the unordered point cloud to preserve more geometric details.Specifically, our framework employs ResNet50 and PointNet++ to derive featuresfrom RGB and point cloud, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a novelpyramid deep fusion network (PDFNet) to aggregate features at different scales,which demonstrates superior efficacy compared to previous fusion strategies.Furthermore, we employ a GCN-based decoder to process the fused features andrecover the corresponding 3D pose and dense mesh. Through comprehensiveablation experiments, we have not only demonstrated the effectiveness of ourproposed fusion algorithm but also outperformed the state-of-the-art approacheson publicly available datasets.

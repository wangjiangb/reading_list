The method approaches the challengemainly as an object segmentation and tracking problem. Video frames areprocessed with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and the resulting masks aretracked through subsequent frames with DeAOT, a method of hierarchicalpropagation for semi-supervised video object segmentation. The geometry of themasks' contours is simplified with the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. Finally,facial traits, pixelation and a basic shadow effect can be optionally added.The results show that the method exhibits an excellent temporal consistency andcan correctly process videos with different poses and appearances, dynamicshots, partial shots and diverse backgrounds. The proposed method provides amore simple and deterministic approach than diffusion models basedvideo-to-video translation pipelines, which suffer from temporal consistencyproblems and do not cope well with pixelated and schematic outputs. The methodis also much most practical than techniques based on 3D human pose estimation,which require custom handcrafted 3D models and are very limited with respect tothe type of scenes they can process.</description><author>Ruben Tous</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 11:15:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09883v1</guid></item><item><title>MogaNet: Multi-order Gated Aggregation Network</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03295v3</link><description>By contextualizing the kernel as global as possible, Modern ConvNets haveshown great potential in computer vision tasks. However, recent progress on\textit{multi-order game-theoretic interaction} within deep neural networks(DNNs) reveals the representation bottleneck of modern ConvNets, where theexpressive interactions have not been effectively encoded with the increasedkernel size. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new family of modernConvNets, dubbed MogaNet, for discriminative visual representation learning inpure ConvNet-based models with favorable complexity-performance trade-offs.MogaNet encapsulates conceptually simple yet effective convolutions and gatedaggregation into a compact module, where discriminative features areefficiently gathered and contextualized adaptively. MogaNet exhibits greatscalability, impressive efficiency of parameters, and competitive performancecompared to state-of-the-art ViTs and ConvNets on ImageNet and variousdownstream vision benchmarks, including COCO object detection, ADE20K semanticsegmentation, 2D\&amp;3D human pose estimation, and video prediction. Notably,MogaNet hits 80.0\% and 87.8\% accuracy with 5.2M and 181M parameters onImageNet-1K, outperforming ParC-Net and ConvNeXt-L, while saving 59\% FLOPs and17M parameters, respectively.

This paper addresses thislimitation and shows that robustness and generalisation to novel scene objectsin 3D object-aware character synthesis can be achieved by training a motionmodel with as few as one reference object. We leverage an implicit featurerepresentation trained on object-only datasets, which encodes anSE(3)-equivariant descriptor field around the object. Given an unseen objectand a reference pose-object pair, we optimise for the object-aware pose that isclosest in the feature space to the reference pose. Finally, we use l-NSM,i.e., our motion generation model that is trained to seamlessly transition fromlocomotion to object interaction with the proposed bidirectional pose blendingscheme. Through comprehensive numerical comparisons to state-of-the-art methodsand in a user study, we demonstrate substantial improvements in 3D virtualcharacter motion and interaction quality and robustness to scenarios withunseen objects.

In response, we introduceLoopy-SLAM that globally optimizes poses and the dense 3D model. We useframe-to-model tracking using a data-driven point-based submap generationmethod and trigger loop closures online by performing global place recognition.Robust pose graph optimization is used to rigidly align the local submaps. Asour representation is point based, map corrections can be performed efficientlywithout the need to store the entire history of input frames used for mappingas typically required by methods employing a grid based mapping structure.Evaluation on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD and ScanNetdatasets demonstrate competitive or superior performance in tracking, mapping,and rendering accuracy when compared to existing dense neural RGBD SLAMmethods.

In the multi-model registration problem, we are given twopoint clouds picturing a set of objects at different poses (and possiblyincluding points belonging to the background) and we want to simultaneouslyreconstruct how all objects moved between the two point clouds. This setupgeneralizes standard 3D registration where one wants to reconstruct a singlepose, e.g., the motion of the sensor picturing a static scene. Moreover, itprovides a mathematically grounded formulation for relevant roboticsapplications, e.g., where a depth sensor onboard a robot perceives a dynamicscene and has the goal of estimating its own motion (from the static portion ofthe scene) while simultaneously recovering the motion of all dynamic objects.We assume a correspondence-based setup where we have putative matches betweenthe two point clouds and consider the practical case where thesecorrespondences are plagued with outliers. We then propose a simple approachbased on Expectation-Maximization (EM) and establish theoretical conditionsunder which the EM approach converges to the ground truth. We evaluate theapproach in simulated and real datasets ranging from table-top scenes toself-driving scenarios and demonstrate its effectiveness when combined withstate-of-the-art scene flow methods to establish dense correspondences.</description><author>David Jin, Sushrut Karmalkar, Harry Zhang, Luca Carlone</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 18:01:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10865v1</guid></item></channel></rss>
